 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(new Error("Rejected instead of resolving."))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of being resolved with the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` call is removed, and the promise would never be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original object would be replaced with a null value when the promise is resolved.

DONE.
