  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the divisor is zero, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` method to return `Complex['NAN']` when the divisor is zero, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'] && this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the divisor is zero and the base is infinite, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
