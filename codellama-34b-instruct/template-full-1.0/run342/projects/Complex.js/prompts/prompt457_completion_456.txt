  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isFinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` returns `true` if the number is finite, but `isInfinite` returns `true` if the number is not at the zero or infinity poles.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.isNaN()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` returns `true` if the number is not a number, but `isInfinite` returns `true` if the number is not at the infinity pole.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.isZero()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` returns `true` if the number is zero, but `isInfinite` returns `true` if the number is not at the zero or infinity poles.

DONE.
