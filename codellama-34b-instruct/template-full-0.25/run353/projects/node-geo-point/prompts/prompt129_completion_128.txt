  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.toTile(this, zoom + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would be called with a different zoom level, which could change the resulting tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.toTile(this, zoom - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would be called with a different zoom level, which could change the resulting tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.toTile(this, zoom + 0.5);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would be called with a fractional zoom level, which could change the resulting tile coordinates.

DONE.
