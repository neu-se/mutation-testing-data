  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid JavaScript object, but it does not have a `dispatch` method, so `this.dispatch(...) => this.undefined.dispatch(...)` would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a JavaScript object and does not have any methods or properties, including `dispatch`. This would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `this.undefined.dispatch(...)`.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value and would evaluate to `false` in a condition, causing the code to fall through to the `else` clause, which would call `defer.reject(...)`.

DONE.
