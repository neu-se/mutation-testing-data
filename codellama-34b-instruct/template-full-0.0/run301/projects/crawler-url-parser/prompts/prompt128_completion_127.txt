  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if `pageurl` is null. If `pageurl` is null, the original code fragment would return "internal", while this new code fragment would return "external".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if `pageurl` is an empty string. If `pageurl` is an empty string, the original code fragment would return "internal", while this new code fragment would return "external".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.indexOf("http") == -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if `pageurl` contains
