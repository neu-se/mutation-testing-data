  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stripBom(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because the stripBom function would be applied to the content twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the JSON.parse function would receive an undefined value as the second argument, which would cause it to be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file
```
This would result in different behavior because the file variable would be passed as the second argument to the JSON.parse function, which would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
