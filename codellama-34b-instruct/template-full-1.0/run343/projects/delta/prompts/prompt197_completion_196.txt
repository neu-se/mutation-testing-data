  Sure, here are three options for mutating the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `newOp` would be set to `otherOp.retain`, which may not be the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of `newOp` would be set to `otherOp.attributes`, which may not be the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = Op.length(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `newOp` would be set to the length of `otherOp`, which may not be the expected behavior.

DONE.
