Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => accum
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the current operation (`curr`) and always returns the initial value, effectively making the `reduce` function return the initial value regardless of the operations in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(accum, curr, index) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds 1 to the accumulated value for each operation, which would lead to an incorrect total that does not reflect the actual operations being reduced.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(curr, accum, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the parameters passed to the predicate function, which may lead to incorrect calculations or logic errors depending on how the predicate is implemented.

DONE.
