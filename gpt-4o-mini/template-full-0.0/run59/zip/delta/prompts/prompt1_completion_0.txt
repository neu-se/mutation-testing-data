Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is an array instead of checking if it is an object, which would allow arrays to pass through while other non-object types (like strings or numbers) would still trigger the reset of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is a string, which would incorrectly reset `a` when it is a string, but would allow other object types to remain unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is strictly equal to `null`, which would not reset `a` for any other non-object types (like undefined or numbers), potentially leading to unexpected results when `a` is not an object.

DONE.
