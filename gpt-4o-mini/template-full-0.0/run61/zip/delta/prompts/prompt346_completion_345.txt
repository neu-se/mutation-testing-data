Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the data from the base operation instead of the operation data, potentially leading to incorrect transformations when inverting operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value to the handler's invert function, which may cause the handler to fail or return unexpected results, leading to incorrect inversion of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the retain value from the current operation instead of the operation data, which could lead to incorrect handling of embedded types and transformations during the inversion process.

DONE.
