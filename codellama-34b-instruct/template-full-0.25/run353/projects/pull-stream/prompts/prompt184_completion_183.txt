  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the next element in the array instead of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the previous element in the array instead of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i+1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the next element in the array instead of the current element, and it would also cause the function to skip over the current element.

DONE.
