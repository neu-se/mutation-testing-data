  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last operation is a deletion and the new operation is an insertion, while the buggy code fragment checks if the last operation is a deletion and the new operation is not null. This could result in different behavior if the last operation is a deletion and the new operation is not an insertion, such as if the last operation is a deletion and the new operation is a retain.
