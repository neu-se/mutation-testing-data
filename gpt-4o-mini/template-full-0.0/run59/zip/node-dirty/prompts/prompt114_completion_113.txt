Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits an 'error' event instead of a 'load' event, which could lead to the application handling the situation incorrectly, as it would expect a successful load event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'load' event with an incremented size value, which could mislead the application into thinking that there is one more item in the data than there actually is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'load' event with double the size of the data, which could cause the application to misinterpret the amount of data loaded, potentially leading to incorrect processing or assumptions about the data state.

DONE.
