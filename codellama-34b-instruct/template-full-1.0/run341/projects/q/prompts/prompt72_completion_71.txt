  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with an argument of `0`, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with an argument of `false`, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with an argument of `null`, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
