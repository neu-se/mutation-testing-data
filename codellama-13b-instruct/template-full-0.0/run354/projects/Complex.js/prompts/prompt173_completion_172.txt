  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `this['isInfinite']()` or `z['isInfinite']()` is true, while the modified code fragment checks if both are true. This could potentially cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `this['isZero']()` or `z['isZero']()` is true, while the modified code fragment checks if both are true. This could potentially cause the function to return `Complex['ZERO']` when it should not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because
