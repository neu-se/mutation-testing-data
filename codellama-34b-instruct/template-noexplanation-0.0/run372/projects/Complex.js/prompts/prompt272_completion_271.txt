  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This change will cause the `arg` method to return the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which may cause incorrect results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This change will cause the `arg` method to return a value that is one unit greater than the imaginary part of the complex number, which may cause incorrect results in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This change will cause the `arg` method to return a value that is twice the imaginary part of the complex number, which may cause incorrect results in some cases.

DONE.
