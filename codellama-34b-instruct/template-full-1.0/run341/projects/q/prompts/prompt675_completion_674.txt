  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+1` would cause the string to concatenate with an integer, resulting in an invalid method name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"+"toString"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the string to concatenate with the string "toString", resulting in the method name "applytoString", which is not defined in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[0]` would cause the first character of the string "apply" to be accessed, resulting in the character "a".

DONE.
