  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is equal to `true`, while the new code fragment checks if `end` is equal to `false`. If `end` is not equal to `false`, the new code fragment will return `end`, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
