  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "object" && module.exports === exports
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `module.exports` property is equal to the `exports` object, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "object" && module.exports !== exports
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `module.exports` property is not equal to the `exports` object, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "object" && module.exports === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `module.exports` property is equal to `null`, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
