  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the path to lowercase, which could cause the code to look for a file with a different name than the one that exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the path into an array of strings using the `/` character as a delimiter, and the `pop()` method would return the last element of the array, which could cause the code to look for a file in a different directory than the one that exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.replace('file.txt', 'file2.txt')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace the string `'file.txt'` with `'file2.txt'` in the path, which could cause the code to look for a file
