 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
void(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line is attempting to call the `fail` method on the result of `Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs)`, while the modified line does nothing due to the `void` keyword.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve;
