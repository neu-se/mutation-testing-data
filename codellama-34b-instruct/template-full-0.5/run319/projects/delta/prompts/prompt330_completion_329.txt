  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of the op, while `Op.length + 1` would return the length of the op plus one. This would cause the `slice` method to include one more character than it should, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of the op, while `Op.length - 1` would return the length of the op minus one. This would cause the `slice` method to exclude one character than it should, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of the op, while `Op.length * 2` would return the length of the op multiplied by two. This would cause
