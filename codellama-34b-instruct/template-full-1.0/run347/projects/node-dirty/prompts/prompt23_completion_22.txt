  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` call is removed, which could cause the `drain` event to not be emitted even if the queue is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); if (this._queue.size > 0) this.emit('drain'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition is inverted, which could cause the `drain` event to be emitted even if the queue is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); this._queue.clear(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_queue` is cleared, which could cause the `drain` event to be emitted multiple times.

DONE.
