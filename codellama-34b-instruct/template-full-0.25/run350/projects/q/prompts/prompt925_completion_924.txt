  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable that is not defined in the context of the code snippet, and would therefore cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function that creates a new deferred object, which would not be the same as the existing `deferred` object that is used in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` is a function that creates a new promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas the existing code uses `deferred.resolve()` to resolve the promise with the given value.

DONE.
