Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's values instead of its keys, which would cause the subsequent logic that relies on the key to fail or behave incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs, which would change the expected structure of the data being processed, potentially leading to errors in the transformation logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns all properties (including non-enumerable ones) of an object, which may not align with the original intent of only processing enumerable properties, leading to unexpected results in the transformation.

DONE.
