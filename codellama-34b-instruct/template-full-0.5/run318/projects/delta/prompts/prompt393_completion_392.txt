  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next element, which may not be the desired behavior in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move backward to the previous element, which may not be the desired behavior in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator, which may not be the desired behavior in this context.

DONE.
