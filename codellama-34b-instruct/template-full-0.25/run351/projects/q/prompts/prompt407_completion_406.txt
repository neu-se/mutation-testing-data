  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the result of the `isPromise` function, so if `value` is a promise, the resulting promise would be rejected, and if `value` is not a promise, the resulting promise would be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function checks if `value` is an object with a `then` method, which is a more relaxed check than `isPromise`. If `value` is a promise, the resulting promise would be fulfilled, but if `value` is not a promise, the resulting promise would be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPending(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPending` function checks if `value` is a promise that is
