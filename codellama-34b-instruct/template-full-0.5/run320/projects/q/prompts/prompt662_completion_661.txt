  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, which would result in a different subset of the `arguments` array being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, which would result in a different subset of the `arguments` array being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, which would result in a different subset of the `arguments` array being returned.

DONE.
