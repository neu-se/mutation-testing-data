  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
