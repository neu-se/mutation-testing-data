  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is expecting an `err` object as its first argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This could cause the program to behave unexpectedly when errors arise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is expecting an `err` object as its first argument, but `undefined` is being passed instead. This could cause the program to behave unexpectedly when errors arise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is expecting an `err` object as its first argument, but a string is being passed instead. This could cause the program to behave unexpectedly when errors arise.

DONE.
