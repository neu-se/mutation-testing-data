  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply(object, [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` is a function that applies a function to a list of arguments, but in this case, it is being used as a property accessor, which would result in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.invoke(object, key, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.invoke` is a function that invokes a method on an object, but in this case, it is being used as a property accessor, which would result in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.set(object, key, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set` is a function that sets a property on an object, but in this case, it is being used as a property accessor, which would result in a different value being returned.
