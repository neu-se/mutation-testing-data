  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(/[a-z]\)
```
This would result in different behavior because the RegExp pattern is different from the original code fragment, and it would split the linkurl_path at different positions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/[a-z]/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the RegExp pattern is different from the original code fragment, and it would replace a different string in linkurl_path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the RegExp pattern is different from the original code fragment, and it would replace a different string in linkurl_path.

DONE.
