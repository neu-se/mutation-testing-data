  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x => x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x => x` is the identity function, which returns its input unchanged. This would cause the program to not make any changes to the input value, making the function essentially a no-op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x => x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the input value, causing the function to have a different output for the same input.

DONE.
