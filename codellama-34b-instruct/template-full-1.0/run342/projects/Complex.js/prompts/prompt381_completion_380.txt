  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(a)` returns the hyperbolic cosine of `a`, while the new code fragment `cosh(a) + 1` returns the sum of the hyperbolic cosine of `a` and `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(a)` returns the hyperbolic cosine of `a`, while the new code fragment `sinh(a)` returns the hyperbolic sine of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(a)` returns the hyperbolic cosine of `a`, while the new code fragment `cosh(b)` returns the hyperbolic cosine of `b`.
