  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin()` and `Math.cos()` have different outputs for the same input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x => x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function being passed to `Complex` is now a different one, so the output of `sqrt` would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the function being passed to `Complex` always returns the same value, regardless of the input passed to `sqrt`.

DONE.
