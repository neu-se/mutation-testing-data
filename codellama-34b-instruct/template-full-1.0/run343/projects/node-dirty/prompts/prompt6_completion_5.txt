  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete()` method takes only one argument, but the original code fragment passed two arguments. This change would cause the method to delete the key-value pair from the Map, rather than setting the value of the key to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set()` method sets the value of the key to `val + 1`, rather than the original value of `val`. This change would cause the database to store incorrect data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val.toUpperCase());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set()` method sets the value of the key to the uppercase version of `val`, rather than the original value of `val`. This change would cause the database to store incorrect
