  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "d"
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operator `+` would cause the string "deleted" to be returned, which is not a valid property name and would result in a `ReferenceError` when trying to access the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator `+` would cause the string "delete" to be converted to a number, resulting in `NaN`, which would then be concatenated with the number `1`, resulting in the string "NaN1". This would not be a valid property name and would result in a `ReferenceError` when trying to access the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator `-` would cause the string "delete" to be converted to a number, resulting in `NaN`, which would then be subtract
