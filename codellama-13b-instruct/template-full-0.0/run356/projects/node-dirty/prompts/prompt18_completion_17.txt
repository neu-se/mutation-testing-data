  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the callbacks array, rather than the array itself. This could cause issues if the callbacks array is expected to be iterated over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the callbacks array, rather than the original array. This could cause issues if the callbacks array is expected to be modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with the callbacks array as its first element, rather than the original array. This could cause issues if the callbacks array is expected to be modified.

DONE.
