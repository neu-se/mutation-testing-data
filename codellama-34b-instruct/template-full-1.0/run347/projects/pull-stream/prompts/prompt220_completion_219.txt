  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `null` before passing it to the callback, but `abort` could be a truthy value that is also not `null`, which would cause the callback to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `null` before passing it to the callback, but `undefined` is a falsey value that is also not `null`, which would cause the callback to be called with `undefined` instead of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, since `null` is the value that is being checked for.

DONE.
