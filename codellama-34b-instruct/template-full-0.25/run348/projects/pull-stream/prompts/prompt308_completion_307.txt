  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, which means that the `ended` variable would be set to `true` instead of `false` when the `read` function is called with `end` set to `true`. This would cause the `terminate` function to be called instead of the `read` function, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `ended` variable to be set to `true` only if both `ended` and `end` are `true`. This would cause the `read` function to be called instead of the `terminate` function, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `ended` variable to be
