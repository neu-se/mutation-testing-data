  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the second argument would cause the `query` property of the returned URL object to be omitted, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the third argument would cause the `search` property of the returned URL object to be omitted, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value passed as the third argument would cause the `search` property of the returned URL object to be included, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

DONE.
