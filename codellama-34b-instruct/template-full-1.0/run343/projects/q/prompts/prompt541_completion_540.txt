  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code pass `undefined` as the `this` value to the `apply` method, which would likely cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code pass `null` as the `this` value to the `apply` method, which would likely cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code pass the current scope as the `this` value to the `apply` method, which would likely cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
