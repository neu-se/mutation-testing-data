  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the elements in the array would be reversed, which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array would contain two references to the same object, which could cause issues if the code relies on the array having unique elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array would contain two null references, which could cause issues if the code relies on the array having non-null elements.

DONE.
