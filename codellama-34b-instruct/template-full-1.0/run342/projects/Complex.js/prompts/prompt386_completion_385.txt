  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `b` to calculate the complex tangent, while the new code fragment uses `a`. This change would affect the calculation of the tangent and all subsequent operations that use it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `b` to calculate the complex tangent, while the new code fragment uses `1 / b`. This change would invert the tangent calculated, resulting in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `b` to calculate the complex tangent, while the new code fragment uses `b + 1`. This change would shift the tangent calculated to the right by one unit, resulting in a different value.

DONE.
