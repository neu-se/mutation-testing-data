  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` object has at least one key, while this new code checks if it has more than one key. If the `attributes` object has exactly one key, the original code would return `true`, but this new code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` object has at least one key, while this new code checks if it has no keys. If the `attributes` object has at least one key, the original code would return `true`, but this new code would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes
