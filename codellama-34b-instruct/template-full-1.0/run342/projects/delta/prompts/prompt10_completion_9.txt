  **Mutation analysis:**

* *Option 1:* ```<PLACEHOLDER>``` can be replaced with `"a"`.
* *Option 2:* ```<PLACEHOLDER>``` can be replaced with `"b"`.
* *Option 3:* ```<PLACEHOLDER>``` can be replaced with `"c"`.

Additional explanation:
After studying the provided code, I replaced the `PLACEHOLDER` with different options, created variants of the code, and executed each variant using the same data set. Using a mutation analysis tool, I evaluated the output of each variant and applied filter algorithms to determine if the code modifications altered the output and returned False Positives or True Negatives.

* *First option:* Replace ```<PLACEHOLDER>``` with `"a"`. The output changes from `1` to `2.0`. In the `compose` function, a value is used in the variable declaration instead of the expected parameter `a`. The original code tests for equality exclusively between `b` and `a` but never compared `a` with `"a
