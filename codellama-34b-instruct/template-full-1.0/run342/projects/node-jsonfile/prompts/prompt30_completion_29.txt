  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` refers to the `obj` object, but `null` is a constant null value. The `JSON.stringify()` method would return a different string in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` refers to the `obj` object, but `undefined` is a constant undefined value. The `JSON.stringify()` method would return a different string in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` refers to the `obj` object, but `''` is an empty string. The `JSON.stringify()` method would return a different string in this case.

DONE.
