  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, which is a function that is called with the `end` and `data` arguments. By negating the value of `cb`, the function would not be called, and the code would behave differently.

DONE.
