Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the module exports to be skipped entirely if the `module` object is not defined, which is the opposite of the original intent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the module from being exported if `module` is not an object, which would be incorrect in environments where `module` is expected to be an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the export statements if `module.exports` is explicitly `null`, which is not a valid condition for exporting the `Delta` class and would lead to the class not being exported at all.

DONE.
