  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `href` attribute of the `<base>` element, whereas the original code fragment would return the jQuery object for the `<base>` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the property value of the `href` property of the `<base>` element, whereas the original code fragment would return the jQuery object for the `<base>` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href', 'new_url')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `href` attribute of the `<base>` element to `new_url`, whereas the original code fragment would return the jQuery object for the `<base>` element.

DONE.
