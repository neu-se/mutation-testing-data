  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would no longer check for the specific case where both `a` and `b` are zero, and would instead check for any positive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would no longer check for the specific case where `a` and `b` are equal, and would instead check for any value where `a` and `b` are both equal to each other.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) < 1 && Math.abs(b) < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would check for the specific case where `a` and `b` are both negative, and would no longer check for the specific case where `a` and `b` are both equal to zero.

DONE.
