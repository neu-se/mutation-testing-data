  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head")
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it explicitly specifies the "head" property instead of relying on the default behavior of the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it explicitly specifies the "tail" property instead of relying on the default behavior of the `get` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head").get("tail")
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it explicitly specifies the "head" property and then gets the "tail" property of the resulting promise.

DONE.
