  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch(object, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is a function that is not defined in the provided code snippet, and it is not clear what its purpose is or how it should be implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[op](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object[op]` is a function that is not defined in the provided code snippet, and it is not clear what its purpose is or how it should be implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.op(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.op` is a function that is not defined in the provided code snippet, and it is not clear what its purpose is or how it should be implemented.

DONE.
