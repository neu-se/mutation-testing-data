  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/[^/]+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a capture group to match any character other than a slash, but the new code only matches a literal `/`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'[^/]+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a capture group to match any character other than a slash, but the new code matches any character other than a slash without using a capture group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'(?:[^/]+?)'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a capture group to match any character other than a slash, but the new code uses a non-capturing group to match the same pattern.

DONE.
