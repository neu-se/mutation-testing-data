  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'close' event is emitted when the output stream is closed, while the 'end' event is emitted when the output stream has finished writing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'close' event is emitted when the output stream is closed, while the 'finish' event is emitted when the output stream has finished writing and all data has been flushed to the underlying system.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'close' event is emitted when the output stream is closed, while the 'error' event is emitted when an error occurs while writing to the output stream.

DONE.
