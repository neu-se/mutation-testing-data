  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the first element of the `coordinates` array, while the original code fragment checks the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the second element of the `coordinates` array, while the original code fragment checks the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `coordinates` array, while the original code fragment checks the contents of the array.

DONE.
