  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because a retain operation is different from a delete operation. If the code is expecting a delete operation, it may not handle a retain operation correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain' && length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match if the length of the operation is greater than 0. If the operation has a length of 0, it would not match the condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because an insert operation is different from a delete operation. If the code is expecting a delete operation, it may not handle an insert operation correctly.

DONE.
