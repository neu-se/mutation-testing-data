Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function(v) { throw new Error("Buggy code"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).then(function(v) { throw new Error("Buggy code"); })` is a rejected promise with the error message "Bug
