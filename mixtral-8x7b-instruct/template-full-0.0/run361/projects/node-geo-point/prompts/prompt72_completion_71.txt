 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / (distance * radius)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of δ, which might cause incorrect calculations in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(distance) / radius
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always make δ positive, which might cause incorrect calculations in the `calculateDestination` method when the distance is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
distance * radius
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the distance by the radius instead of dividing, which would lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDestination` method.

DONE.
