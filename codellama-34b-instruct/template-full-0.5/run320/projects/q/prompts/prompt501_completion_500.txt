  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`. In the context of the code, `void 0` is used to indicate that the function should return `undefined` when called with no arguments. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to return `null` instead, which could potentially break the code that relies on the function returning `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`. In the context of the code, `void 0` is used to indicate that the function should return `undefined` when called with no arguments.
