  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `undefined`, which is a different value than `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `null`, which is a different value than `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Oops!"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with an error, rather than resolved with `value`.

DONE.
