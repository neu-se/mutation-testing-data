 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the result's imaginary part would be incorrect for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be incorrect for certain input values, especially when the input's imaginary part is zero or negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the result's sign would be incorrect for certain input values.

By introducing these changes, the mutated code will produce different results compared to the original code, revealing potential weaknesses in the test suite. DONE.
