 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison using `===` is more strict than using `!`. It would cause the code to only bypass the assignment of `cb` to `test` when `cb` is explicitly set to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison using `===` is more strict than using `!`. It would cause the code to only bypass the assignment of `cb` to `test` when `cb` is explicitly set to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `cb` is of the `undefined` type, rather than just checking if it is equal to `undefined`. This would cause the code to bypass the assignment of `cb` to `test` when `cb` is not defined (e.g.,
