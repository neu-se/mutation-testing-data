  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, while this code checks for greater than. If the number of parts in the link URL is greater than the number of parts in the page URL, the link would be considered "sublevel" instead of "internal".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, while this code checks for less than. If the number of parts in the link URL is less than the number of parts in the page URL, the link would be considered "uplevel" instead of "internal".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.length == pageurl_parts.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, while this code checks for equality of the length of the two arrays. If the number of parts in the link URL is
