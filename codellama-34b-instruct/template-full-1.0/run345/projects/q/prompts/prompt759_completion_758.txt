  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecate(allResolved, "allResolved", "allSettled");
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `deprecate` would be called instead of `allResolved`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved = allSettled;
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is being reassigned to `allSettled` instead of the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved = backSettled;
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is being reassigned to a non-existent function `backSettled`.

DONE.
