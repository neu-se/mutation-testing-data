 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty object as the second argument to `getCountryForTimezone`, whereas the original code passes the `options` variable, which might contain custom values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `null` as the second argument to `getCountryForTimezone`, whereas the original code passes the `options` variable, which might contain custom values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty object as the second argument to `getCountryForTimezone` when `options` is falsy, whereas the original code passes the `options` variable, which might contain custom values.

DONE.
