  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be resolved with `null`, instead of the original value of the promise `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be resolved with `undefined`, instead of the original value of the promise `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be resolved with a random number, instead of the original value of the promise `promise`.

DONE.
