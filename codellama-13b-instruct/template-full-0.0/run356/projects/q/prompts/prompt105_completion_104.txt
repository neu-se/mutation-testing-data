  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `basis` argument is not used in the original code fragment, and replacing it with `this[index]` would cause the function to return the value of the `index`th element in the array, rather than the `basis` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basis` argument as the initial value for the `reduce` function, and replacing it with `basis, this[index], index` would cause the function to use the `index`th element in the array as the initial value, rather than the `basis` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index], basis
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basis` argument as the initial value for the `reduce` function, and replacing it with `
