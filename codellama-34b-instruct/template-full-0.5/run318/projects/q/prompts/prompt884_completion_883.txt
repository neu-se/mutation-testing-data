  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nfapply` method to be called on the `this` object, which may not have the same behavior as calling `fapply` on the `deferred` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fapply` method to be called on the `deferred` object, which may not have the same behavior as calling `nfapply` on the `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fapply` method to be called on the `Q` object, which may not have the same behavior as calling `nfapply` on the `this` object.

DONE.
