  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is not an object, while this replacement checks if it is an object. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `lastOp` is an object, which would result in the `newOp` being inserted before the `lastOp` instead of after it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is not an object, while this replacement checks if the `insert` property of `lastOp` is not null. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `lastOp` is an object with a non-null `insert` property, which would result in the `newOp` being inserted before the `lastOp` instead of after it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
