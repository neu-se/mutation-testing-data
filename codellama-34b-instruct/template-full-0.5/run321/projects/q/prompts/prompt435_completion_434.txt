  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a function, and `typeof process.emit === "function"` would always evaluate to `true`, while `process.emit === "function"` would only evaluate to `true` if `process.emit` is a string that is equal to `"function"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a function, and `typeof process.emit === "function"` would always evaluate to `true`, while `process.emit === "function"` would only evaluate to `true` if `process.emit` is a string that is equal to `"function"`.

typeof process === "object" && typeof process.emit === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a
