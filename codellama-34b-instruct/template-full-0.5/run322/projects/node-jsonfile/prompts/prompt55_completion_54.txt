  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` argument is now 1 more than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` argument is now 1 less than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` argument is now twice the original value.

DONE.
