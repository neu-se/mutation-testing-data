 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.thenResolve` function would always return a promise that is immediately resolved with `undefined`, instead of resolving with the provided value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(value)))
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be resolved asynchronously, instead of synchronously. This could lead to unexpected behavior in code that relies on the promise being resolved immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject('An error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be rejected with an error message, instead of being resolved with the provided value. This could lead to unexpected behavior in code that expects the promise to be resolved successfully.

DONE.
