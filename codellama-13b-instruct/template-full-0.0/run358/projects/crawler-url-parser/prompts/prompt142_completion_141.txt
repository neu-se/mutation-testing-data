  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would no longer match the default file extension, which is ".html" in this case. This could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would now match a space character instead of the default file extension. This could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would now match a period character instead of the default file extension. This could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
