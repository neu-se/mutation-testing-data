  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == undefined || a == null
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but uses the equality operator instead of the identity operator. This change will not affect the behavior of the code, but it is a valid mutation that can be used to test the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === 0
```
This code fragment adds an additional condition to the original, checking if `a` is equal to `0`. This change will not affect the behavior of the code, but it is a valid mutation that can be used to test the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === NaN
```
This code fragment adds an additional condition to the original, checking if `a` is equal to `NaN`. This change will not affect the behavior of the code, but it is a valid mutation that can be used to test the test suite.
