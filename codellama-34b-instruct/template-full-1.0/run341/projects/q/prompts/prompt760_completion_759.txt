  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` returns a new array with the modified elements, while `array_filter` returns a new array containing only the elements that pass a given test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` returns a new array with the modified elements, while `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` returns a new array with the modified elements, while `array_splice` modifies the original array.

DONE.
