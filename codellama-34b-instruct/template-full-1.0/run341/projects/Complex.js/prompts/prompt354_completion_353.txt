  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return 0 for all inputs, instead of the correct value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the sum of the real and imaginary parts, instead of the correct value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return twice the real part, instead of the correct value.

DONE.
