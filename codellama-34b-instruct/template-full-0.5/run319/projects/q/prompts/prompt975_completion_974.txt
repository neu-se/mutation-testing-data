  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nmapply` method to always return the same array, regardless of the arguments passed to the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nmapply` method to return `null` instead of a promise, which would cause any code that relies on the promise to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nmapply` method to return the string "hello" instead of a promise, which would cause any code that relies on the promise to fail.

DONE.
