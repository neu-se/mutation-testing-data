  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op]()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `apply()` method to call the function stored in the `descriptor` object, while this alternative code fragment assumes that the function is a method of the `descriptor` object and calls it directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `args` array as an argument to the `apply()` method, while this alternative code fragment passes the `args` array as an argument to the function stored in the `descriptor` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op](resolve, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `resolve` function as the first argument to the `apply()` method, while this alternative code fragment passes the `resolve` function as the first argument to the function stored in the `descriptor`
