  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` is a different function than `Complex.pow`, and it may produce different results for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` is a different function than `Complex.exp`, and it may produce different results for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` is a different function than `Complex.sqrt`, and it may produce different results for certain inputs.

DONE.
