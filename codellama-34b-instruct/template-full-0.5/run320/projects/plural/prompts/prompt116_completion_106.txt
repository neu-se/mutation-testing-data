  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.concat(clothes, games, illnesses)
```
This would result in different behavior because `misc.concat(clothes, games, illnesses)` is a different array than `misc`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.slice(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because `misc.slice(0, 10)` is a different array than `misc`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.filter(function(word) { return word.length > 5 })
```
This would result in different behavior because `misc.filter(function(word) { return word.length > 5 })` is a different array than `misc`.

DONE.
