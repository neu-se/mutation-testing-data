  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data !== test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would test for strict inequality instead of strict equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.includes(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `data` object includes the `test` string, instead of checking if the two are strictly equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.indexOf(data) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `test` string contains the `data` object, instead of checking if the two are strictly equal.

DONE.
