  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to always resolve the promise with an array of all arguments, instead of just the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length >= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to always resolve the promise with an array of all arguments, instead of just the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to always resolve the promise with an array of all arguments, instead of just the second argument.

DONE.
