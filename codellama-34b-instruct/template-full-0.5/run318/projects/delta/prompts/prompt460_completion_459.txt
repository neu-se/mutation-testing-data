  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.index` variable is being incremented by 1, which would cause the `rest()` method to return a different subset of the `this.ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.ops.length` property is being subtracted from `this.index`, which would cause the `rest()` method to return a different subset of the `this.ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index % this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.index` variable is being moduloed by `this.ops.length`, which would cause the `rest()` method to return a different subset of the `this.ops` array.

DONE.
