  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `isPromise` function, potentially causing the `then` method to be called on a non-promise value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value is a promise-like object, which may have different behavior than the original `isPromise` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is fulfilled, which may cause the `then` method to be called on a fulfilled promise, potentially causing different behavior.

DONE.
