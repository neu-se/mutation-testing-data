  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return reject(new Error(exception));`, which creates a new Error object with the exception as the message, whereas the new code fragment simply returns the exception object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error(exception.message));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return reject(new Error(exception));`, which creates a new Error object with the exception as the message, whereas the new code fragment creates a new Error object with the exception's message as the message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error(exception.stack));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return reject(new Error(exception));`, which creates a new Error object with the exception as the message, whereas the new code fragment creates a new Error object with the exception's stack trace as the message.
