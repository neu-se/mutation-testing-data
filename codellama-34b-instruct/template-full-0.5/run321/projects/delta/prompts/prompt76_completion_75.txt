  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` is set to `null` instead of the original value, which could cause the `insert` method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain` is set to `-1` instead of the original value, which could cause the `retain` method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { foo: 'bar' };
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.attributes` is set to a different object than the original value, which could cause the `attributes` method to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
