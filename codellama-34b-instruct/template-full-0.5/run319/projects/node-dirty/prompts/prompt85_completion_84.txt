  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.split` splits the buffer into an array of substrings, while `buffer.split('')` splits the buffer into an array of individual characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.split` splits the buffer into an array of substrings, while `buffer.split(undefined)` splits the buffer into an array of substrings, but only if the separator is not found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.split` splits the buffer into an array of substrings, while `buffer.split(null)` splits the buffer into an array of substrings, but only if the separator is not found.

DONE.
