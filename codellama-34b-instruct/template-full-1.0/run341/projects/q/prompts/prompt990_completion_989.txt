  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an iterable object, unlike `arguments`, and it will throw a TypeError when trying to call `array_slice` on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first two arguments to `array_slice`, whereas the original code fragment passes all arguments except the first two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is a valid iterable object, but it has a different length and contents than `arguments`, and it will cause the `array_slice` method to behave differently.

DONE.
