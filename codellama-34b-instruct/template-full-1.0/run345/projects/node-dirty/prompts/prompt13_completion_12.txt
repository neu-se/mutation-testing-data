  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cbs` is not `undefined`, but `1` is truthy, so `cb` would be pushed to the `cbs` array even if `cbs` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cbs` is not `undefined`, but `!cbs` is `true` if `cbs` is `undefined`, so `cb` would not be pushed to the `cbs` array if `cbs` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cbs` is not `undefined`, but `cbs.length` is `0` if `cbs` is `undefined`, so `cb` would not be pushed to the `cbs
