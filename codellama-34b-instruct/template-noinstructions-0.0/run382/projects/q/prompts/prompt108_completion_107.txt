  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing an infinite loop or skipping over certain elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, potentially missing certain elements or processing them twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would restart from the beginning of the array instead of continuing from the current index, potentially causing an infinite loop or processing the same elements multiple times.

DONE.
