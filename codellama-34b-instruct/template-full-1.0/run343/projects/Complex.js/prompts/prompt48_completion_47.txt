  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] < 0 || a['arg'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `Complex.INFINITY`, regardless of the values of `a['abs']` and `a['arg']`. In the original code, `Complex.INFINITY` is only returned if `a['abs']` is not finite and `a['arg']` is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] > 0 && a['arg'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex.INFINITY` only if `a['abs']` is positive and `a['arg']` is negative. In the original code, `Complex.INFINITY` is returned if `a['abs']` is not finite and `a['arg']` is finite, regardless of their signs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'].
