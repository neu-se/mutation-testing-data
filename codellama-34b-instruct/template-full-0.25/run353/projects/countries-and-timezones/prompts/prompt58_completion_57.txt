  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeTimezone` is a different function than `memoizeCountry`, and it would cause the code to memoize timezones instead of countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeCountry(timezone)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to memoize countries instead of timezones, and it would pass the timezone object as an argument to the `memoizeCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(country)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to memoize timezones instead of countries, and it would pass the country object as an argument to the `memoizeTimezone` function.

DONE.
