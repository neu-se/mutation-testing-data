  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to the `array_slice` function would be different, potentially causing the function to return a different array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is not defined in the context of the `fbind` function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the `fbound` function, which does not have an `arguments` property.

DONE.
