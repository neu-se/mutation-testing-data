 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the object being constructed with `null`, which could cause issues when trying to access properties like `current` and `all`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the object being constructed with an empty object, which would not have the `current` and `all` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the object being constructed with an array containing the `id`, which would not have the `current` and `all` properties.

By introducing these changes, we can test the effectiveness of the project's test suite in catching unexpected behavior caused by mutations in the code. DONE.
