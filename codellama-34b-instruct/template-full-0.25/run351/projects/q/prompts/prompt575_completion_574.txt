  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is not called with the correct `this` context, which would cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is called with `null` as the `this` context, which would cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is called with `undefined` as the `this` context, which would cause the code to fail.

DONE.
