  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of `err`, so the code would enter the `else` branch if `err` is truthy, and the `if` branch if `err` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the code would enter the `if` branch if `err` is strictly equal to `false`, and the `else` branch if `err` is not strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the code would enter the `if` branch if `err` is strictly not equal to `true`, and the `else` branch if `err` is strictly equal to `true`.

DONE.
