  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.toString()` method is not defined in the browser environment, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object Object]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.toString()` method is not defined in the browser environment, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process` variable is not defined in the browser environment, so the comparison would always return `true`.

DONE.
