  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would remove the last element of the array, while `0` would remove the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would remove the last element of the array, while `-1` would remove the first element in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would remove the last element of the array, while `2` would remove the second-to-last element.

DONE.
