  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, leading to a different calculation of the magnitude and argument of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, leading to a different calculation of the magnitude and argument of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different formula for the magnitude and argument of the complex number, which would lead to different results in the calculations of the complex operations.

DONE.
