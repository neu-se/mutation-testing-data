 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''.concat(content.replace)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the result of `content.replace` to a string, which may cause issues if the result is expected to be a function or other data type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString().replace
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `content` to be converted to a string before calling the `replace` method, which may not match the expected behavior if `content` is a buffer or another non-string data type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/g/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regular expression passed to the `replace` method, potentially causing it to match or replace different parts of the string.

DONE.
