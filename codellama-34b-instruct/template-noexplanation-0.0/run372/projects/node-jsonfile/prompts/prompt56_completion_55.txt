  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replaceAll
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to replace all occurrences of `\n` with `EOL`, instead of just the first occurrence. This could potentially cause issues if the input string contains multiple lines, as the output string may not be properly formatted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/\\n/g, EOL)
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to replace all occurrences of `\\n` with `EOL`, instead of just the first occurrence. This could potentially cause issues if the input string contains multiple lines, as the output string may not be properly formatted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/\\n/g, EOL) + EOF
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to replace all occurrences of `\\n` with `EOL`, and then append `EOF` to the end of the output string. This could potentially cause issues
