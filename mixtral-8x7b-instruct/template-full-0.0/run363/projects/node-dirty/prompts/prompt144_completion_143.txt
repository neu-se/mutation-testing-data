 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0 || this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if there are more flights than in-progress writes or if `this._waitForDrain` is true, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._inFlightWrites || this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there are no in-flight writes or if `this._waitForDrain` is true, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there are more than 0 in-flight writes and if `this._waitForDrain` is false, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.
