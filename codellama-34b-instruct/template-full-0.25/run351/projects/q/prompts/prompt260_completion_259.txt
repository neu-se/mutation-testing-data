  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will invert the truthiness of the value, so if the original code fragment was `value`, the new code fragment would be `!value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator will add 1 to the value, so if the original code fragment was `value`, the new code fragment would be `value + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator will multiply the value by 2, so if the original code fragment was `value`, the new code fragment would be `value * 2`.

DONE.
