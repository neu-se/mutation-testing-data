  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`. In the context of the code, `null` would be passed as the `this` value to the `fulfilled` function, while `void 0` would be passed as `undefined`.

DONE.
