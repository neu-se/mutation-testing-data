 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would no longer be called with the new exception, but instead with the original value. This could mask errors and make it harder to detect issues in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with `null` instead of the new exception. This could cause unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the rejected promise to contain an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with a resolved promise instead of the new exception. This could cause unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the rejected promise to contain an error object.

DONE.
