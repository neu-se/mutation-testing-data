  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the `done` variable, so even if `done` is `true`, the expression would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than `||`, so the expression would evaluate to `false` if `done` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than `&&`, so the expression would evaluate to `true` if `done` is `false`.

DONE.
