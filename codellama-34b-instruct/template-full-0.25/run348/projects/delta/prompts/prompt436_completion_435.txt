  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not the same as the `delete` property, and the `retain` property is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is not the same as the `delete` property, and the `insert` property is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.attributes === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property is not the same as the `delete` property, and the `attributes` property is an object.

DONE.
