  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is used to specify the URL of an image, while the `href` attribute is used to specify the URL of a link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'text'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `text` attribute is used to specify the text content of an element, while the `href` attribute is used to specify the URL of a link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' + 'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` attribute is used to specify the URL of a link, while the `src` attribute is used to specify the URL of an image. By concatenating the two attributes, the resulting URL would be the combination of the two URLs, which would likely result in a broken link.

DONE.
