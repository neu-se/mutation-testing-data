  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` attribute of the `base` element, which may not be present in the HTML document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` property of the `base` element, which may not be present in the HTML document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('src')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `src` attribute of the `base` element, which may not be present in the HTML document.

DONE.
