  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, rather than the object on which the function was called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, rather than the object on which the function was called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to a new object, rather than the object on which the function was called.

DONE.
