 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` to the callback, while the buggy version passes `null`, which might cause issues if the calling code expects a non-null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` to the callback, while the buggy version passes `undefined`, which might cause issues if the calling code expects a non-undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` to the callback, while the buggy version passes `0`. If the calling code checks for truthy/falsy values, it might treat `0` differently than a non-null/non-undefined value.

DONE.
