  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "0" instead of the null character, which could cause issues in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "1" instead of the null character, which could cause issues in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "2" instead of the null character, which could cause issues in the code that uses the returned value.

DONE.
