  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - r
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function returns the arccosine of a value, which is a value between 0 and π. In contrast, `1 - r` returns a value between -1 and 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function returns a value between 0 and π, while `r * 2` returns a value between 0 and 2π.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function returns a value between 0 and π, while `r / 2` returns a value between 0 and π/2.

DONE.
