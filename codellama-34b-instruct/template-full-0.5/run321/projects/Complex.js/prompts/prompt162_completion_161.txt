  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](z)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['INFINITY']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `INFINITY` property is not defined on the `Complex` object, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` at runtime.

DONE.
