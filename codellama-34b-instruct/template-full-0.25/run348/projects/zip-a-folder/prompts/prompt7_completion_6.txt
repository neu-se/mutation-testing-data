  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `targetFilePath` string to uppercase, which could cause the file to be written to a different location than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would remove the first character of the `targetFilePath` string, which could cause the file to be written to a different location than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `targetFilePath` string with the string `'foo'`, which could cause the file to be written to a different location than expected.

DONE.
