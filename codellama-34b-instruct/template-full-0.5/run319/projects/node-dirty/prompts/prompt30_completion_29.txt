  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, which could cause the get() method to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the get() method to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be converted to uppercase, which could cause the get() method to return the wrong value.

DONE.
