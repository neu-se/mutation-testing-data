 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's `this` value would be set to the global object instead of `thisp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback would receive a number as its `this` value, which is unlikely to be expected by the code consuming the result of `array_map`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback would receive a function as its `this` value, which could cause unintended side effects or incorrect behavior in the code consuming the result of `array_map`.

DONE.
