 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is not called, and the promise's `inspected` property will be set to `null`. This could lead to unexpected behavior when checking the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function is assigned to `inspected`, which may not provide the expected information about the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because a resolved promise is assigned to `inspected`. This could lead to unexpected behavior when checking the promise's state, as the promise is already settled.

DONE.
