  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a method that resolves a promise with a given value, whereas `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with a given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that registers a callback to be invoked when a promise is resolved or rejected, whereas `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with a given reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that registers a callback to be invoked when a promise is rejected, whereas `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with a given reason.

DONE.
