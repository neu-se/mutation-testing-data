  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `nfapply` is expecting an array of arguments to be passed to the callback, but instead it would receive a string "foo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `nfapply` is expecting an array of arguments to be passed to the callback, but instead it would receive `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `nfapply` is expecting an array of arguments to be passed to the callback, but instead it would receive the number `0`.

DONE.
