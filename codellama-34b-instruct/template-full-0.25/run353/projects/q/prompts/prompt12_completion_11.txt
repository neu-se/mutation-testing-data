  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ses` variable is defined, while this replacement checks if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ses` variable is defined, while this replacement checks if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ses` variable is defined, while this replacement checks if it is not null.

DONE.
