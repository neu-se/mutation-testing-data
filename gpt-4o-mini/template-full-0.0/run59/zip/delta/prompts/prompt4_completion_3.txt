Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `b` is `null` or `undefined`, it will default to an empty object, potentially losing any attributes that were supposed to be copied from `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would copy attributes from `a` instead of `b`, which means the resulting `attributes` object would not contain any properties from `b`, leading to incorrect composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).length > 0 ? a : b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prioritize `a` over `b` when `a` has keys, which contradicts the intended behavior of merging attributes from both `a` and `b`.

DONE.
