  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` is used to parse a JSON string into an object, whereas `JSON.stringify` is used to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.replace` is used to replace a substring in a string, whereas `JSON.stringify` is used to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
RegExp.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because `RegExp.exec` is used to execute a regular expression pattern on a string, whereas `JSON.stringify` is used to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string.

DONE.
