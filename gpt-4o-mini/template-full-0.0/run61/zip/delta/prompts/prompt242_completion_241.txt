Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the `otherIter` instead of `thisIter`, potentially leading to incorrect deletions if the lengths of the two iterators differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length by 1, causing one extra element to be skipped or deleted, which could lead to data loss or incorrect state in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length returned by `thisIter.peekLength()`, which could result in attempting to delete more elements than actually exist, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior in the delta operations.

DONE.
