 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.prototype.bind` returns a new function that, when called, will have its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with arguments partially applied. This is different from `uncurryThis`, which simply calls the function with a given `this` value and arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval
