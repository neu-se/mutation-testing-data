  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(Promise.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise with the `Promise.prototype` as its prototype, which is not the same as the original code that used `object_create` to create a new object with `Promise.prototype` as its prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `promise` property of the `deferred` object to the `Promise.prototype` object, which is not the same as the original code that created a new promise object with `object_create`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `promise` property of the `deferred` object to a new function, which is not the same as the original code that created a new promise object with `object_create`.

DONE.
