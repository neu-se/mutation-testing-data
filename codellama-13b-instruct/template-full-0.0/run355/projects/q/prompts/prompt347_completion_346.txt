  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `rejected` argument is a function, while the buggy code fragment checks if the `rejected` argument is a string. This could cause the `rejected` function to be called with a string argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `rejected` argument is a function, while the buggy code fragment checks if the `rejected` argument is an instance of the `Function` class. This could cause the `rejected` function to be called with a different argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `rejected` argument is a
