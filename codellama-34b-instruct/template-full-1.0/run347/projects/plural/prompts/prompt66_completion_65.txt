  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('car', 'carrots')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original addRule() function adds a new rule to the rules list, but this new code fragment sets the result of pluralizing "car" to "carrots."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original addRule() function adds a new rule to the rules list, but this new code fragment sets the result of pluralizing "memo" to false, which would cause the entire plural function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', function(w) { return w + 'os' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original addRule() function adds a new rule to the rules list, but this new code fragment sets the result of pluralizing "memo" to a function that adds an "o" to the end
