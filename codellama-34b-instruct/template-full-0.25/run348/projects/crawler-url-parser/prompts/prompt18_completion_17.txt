  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `baseUrlStr` to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `URL.parse()` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in `baseUrlStr`, which could potentially cause the `URL.parse()` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove the `http://` or `https://` protocol from the beginning of `baseUrlStr`, which could potentially cause the `URL.parse()` method to return a different result.

DONE.
