  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the iterator by 1, potentially skipping over the next operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the iterator by 2, potentially skipping over the next two operations in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the iterator by 3, potentially skipping over the next three operations in the delta.

DONE.
