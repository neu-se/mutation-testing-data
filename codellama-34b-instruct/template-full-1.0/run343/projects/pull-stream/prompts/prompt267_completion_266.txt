  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the `end` variable, meaning that the `nextStream()` function would be called even if `end` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `end` is strictly equal to `true`, which would cause `nextStream()` to be called only if `end` is not only truthy but also strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `end` is not strictly equal to `true`, which would cause `nextStream()` to be called only if `end` is either truthy or strictly equal to `false`.

DONE.
