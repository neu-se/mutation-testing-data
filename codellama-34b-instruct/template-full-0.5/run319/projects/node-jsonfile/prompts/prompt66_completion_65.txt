  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag causes the regular expression to match all occurrences in the string, instead of just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag causes the regular expression to match case-insensitively, so it would also match the string "\uFEFF" instead of just "\uFEFF".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag causes the regular expression to match across multiple lines, so it would also match the string "\uFEFF" at the start of a line, instead of just at the start of the string.

DONE.
