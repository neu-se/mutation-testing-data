  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `object_keys(null)` would return an empty array, whereas `object_keys(value)` would return an array of property names of the `value` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `object_keys(undefined)` would return an empty array, whereas `object_keys(value)` would return an array of property names of the `value` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and `object_keys({})` would return an empty array, whereas `object_keys(value)` would return an array of property names of the `value` object.

DONE.
