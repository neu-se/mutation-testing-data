  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could cause the `allSettled` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sort()` method sorts the elements in the array, which could cause the `allSettled` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the elements from the given start index to the end of the array, which could cause the `allSettled` method to return a different result.

DONE.
