  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, zoom
```
This change will cause the `toTile` method to use the latitude instead of the longitude as the first argument, which will likely result in a different tile being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, zoom
```
This change will cause the `toTile` method to use the longitude instead of the latitude as the first argument, which will likely result in a different tile being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + this.longitude, zoom
```
This change will cause the `toTile` method to use the sum of the latitude and longitude as the first argument, which will likely result in a different tile being returned.

DONE.
