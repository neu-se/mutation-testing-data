  Of course, I can do that.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in the `_rejected` function being used when `_fulfilled` was expected, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled("ERROR")
```
This would result in a literal string "ERROR" being passed as the fulfilled value instead of the expected fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(reject("ERROR"))
```
This would result in the rejected function being used, which could throw an error and cause the program to fail.

**DONE.**
