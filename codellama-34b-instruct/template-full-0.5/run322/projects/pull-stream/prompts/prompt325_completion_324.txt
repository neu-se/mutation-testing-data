  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` operator is the logical NOT operator, which inverts the truthiness of the `end` variable. In the original code, the `end` variable is only passed to the `once` function if it is truthy, but with the `!end` operator, the `once` function would be called even if `end` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND operator, which evaluates the left-hand side expression and only evaluates the right-hand side expression if the left-hand side expression is truthy. In the original code, the `op` function is only called if `end` is truthy, but with the `end && op` expression, the `op` function would be called even if `end` is falsy, as long as `op` is a truthy value.

Option 3:
