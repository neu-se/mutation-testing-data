  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneDeep` would create a deep copy of `newOp`, which would result in a different object reference than the original `newOp` object. This could cause issues if the code relies on the object reference being the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` would create a shallow copy of `newOp`, which would result in a different object reference than the original `newOp` object. This could cause issues if the code relies on the object reference being the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.clone()` would create a deep copy of `newOp`, which would result in a different object reference than the original `newOp` object. This could cause issues if the code relies
