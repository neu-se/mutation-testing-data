  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.isInfinite() && !z.isZero()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the case where both `this` and `z` are zero or infinite, while this new code only checks if `z` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] > 0 && this['im'] === 0 && z['re'] > 0 && z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for any case where both `this` and `z` are not zero or infinite, while this new code only checks if `this` and `z` are both purely real and positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 2 && this['im'] === 0 && z['re'] === 3 && z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for any case where
