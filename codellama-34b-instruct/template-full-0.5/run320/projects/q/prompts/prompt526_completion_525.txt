  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `args` is an array of arguments passed to the `post` method, and `null` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `args` is an array of arguments passed to the `post` method, and `undefined` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `args` is an array of arguments passed to the `post` method, and `[]` is an empty array.

DONE.
