  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb && abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function, and calling it with `()` would execute the function, which is not the intended behavior in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb || abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `||` is a logical OR operator, and `abortCb` is a function, so this expression would always evaluate to `true`, even if `abortCb` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!= null` is a comparison operator, and `abortCb` is a function, so this expression would always evaluate to `true`, even if `abortCb` is not defined.

DONE.
