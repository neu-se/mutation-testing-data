  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is modified by adding 1 to it, which could change the result of the `field(data)` function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is modified by subtracting 1 from it, which could change the result of the `field(data)` function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is modified by multiplying it by 2, which could change the result of the `field(data)` function call.

DONE.
