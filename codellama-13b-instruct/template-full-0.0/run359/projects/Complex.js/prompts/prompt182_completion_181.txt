  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the method to return a different result.

DONE.
