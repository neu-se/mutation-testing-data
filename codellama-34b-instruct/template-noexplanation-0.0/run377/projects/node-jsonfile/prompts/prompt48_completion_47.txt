  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str + 'buggy'
```
This change will cause the `writeFileSync` function to write the string "buggy" to the file, instead of the expected JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `writeFileSync` function to write the value `null` to the file, instead of the expected JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `writeFileSync` function to write the value `undefined` to the file, instead of the expected JSON string.

DONE.
