  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.floor` to round the result to the nearest integer, while the new code fragment rounds down to the nearest integer. This could cause the calculated distance to be off by one meter in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.floor` to round the result to the nearest integer, while the new code fragment rounds up to the nearest integer. This could cause the calculated distance to be off by one meter in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.floor` to round the result to the nearest integer, while the new code fragment rounds to the nearest integer. This could cause the calculated distance to be off by one meter in certain cases.
