  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getTimezone(c, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function is different from the `getCountry` function, and it may return a different result for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { ...options, deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with a different set of options, which may affect its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getTimezonesForCountry(c, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesForCountry` function is different from the `getCountry` function, and it may return a different result for the same input.

DONE.
