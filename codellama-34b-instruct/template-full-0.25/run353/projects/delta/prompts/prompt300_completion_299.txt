  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by a different number of elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by a different number of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by a different number of elements.

DONE.
