  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk()` is not a valid method, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!ses.ok()` is the same as the original code, and would not cause any changes in behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.ok()` is the opposite of the original code, and would cause the `if` statement to be skipped.

DONE.
