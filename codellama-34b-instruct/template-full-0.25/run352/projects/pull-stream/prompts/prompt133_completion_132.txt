  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, whereas this new code fragment calls it with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with a truthy value, whereas this new code fragment calls it with a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, whereas this new code fragment calls it with two arguments, and the second argument is a falsy value.

DONE.
