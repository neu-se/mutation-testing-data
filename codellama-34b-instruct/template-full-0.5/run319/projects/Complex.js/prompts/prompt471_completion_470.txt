  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the imaginary part is equal to 0, while this new code fragment is checking if it is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the imaginary part is equal to 0, while this new code fragment is checking if the real part is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the imaginary part is equal to 0, while this new code fragment is checking if it is equal to Infinity.

DONE.
