  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not greater than 0, while this code checks if `a` is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not equal to `b`, while this code checks if `a` is not identical to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the division of `a` by `b` is equal to 1, while this code performs the division and uses the result in a new expression.

DONE.
