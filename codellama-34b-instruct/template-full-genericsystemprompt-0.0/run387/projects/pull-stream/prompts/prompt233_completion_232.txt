  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with the `data` argument, which is not the same as the original code where the `test` function is called with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with two arguments, which is not the same as the original code where the `test` function is called with one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with two arguments, the second of which is a constant `0`, which is not the same as the original code where the `test` function is called with one argument.

DONE.
