  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q()```
This would result in different behavior because it will create a new Promise object, while the original code fragment resolves the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```resolve, reject```
This would result in different behavior because it will pass the resolve and reject functions to the promise, while the original code fragment passes them to the Q function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```promise => resolve(promise)```
This would result in different behavior because it will create a new promise that resolves to the original promise, while the original code fragment resolves the original promise.

DONE.
