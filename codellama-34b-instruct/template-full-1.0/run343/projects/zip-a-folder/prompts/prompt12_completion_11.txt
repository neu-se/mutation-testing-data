  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.read
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a different function than `access`, and it has a different purpose. The `read` function is used to read the contents of a file, while the `access` function is used to check if a file exists and is readable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.accessSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `accessSync` is the synchronous version of `fs.access`, which means that it blocks the event loop until the operation is complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access.bind(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to a specific context, in this case, the `fs` module. This means that the new function will always use the `fs` module as its context, regardless of where it is called from.

DONE.
