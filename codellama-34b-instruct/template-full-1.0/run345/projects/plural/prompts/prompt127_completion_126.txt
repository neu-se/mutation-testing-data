  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be true, causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute on even iterations, potentially missing certain rules.

DONE.
