  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same value, regardless of the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `inspect` method called on the `promise` object, which might be different from the original `inspect` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `inspect` method called on the `promise` object, which might be different from the original `inspect` method.

DONE.
