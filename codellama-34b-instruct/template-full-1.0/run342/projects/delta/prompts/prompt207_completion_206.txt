  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `retain` property of `otherOp` is defined and is an object, while the new code would always return `null` and execute the `else` branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `otherOp` is an object and has a truthy `retain` property, while the new code would always return an empty object and execute the `if` branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `otherOp` is an object and has a truthy `retain` property, while the new code would check if `otherOp` has a truthy `foo` property and execute the `if` branch.

DONE.
