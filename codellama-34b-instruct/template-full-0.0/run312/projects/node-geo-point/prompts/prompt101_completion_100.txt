  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` is the latitude of the starting point, while `φ2` is the latitude of the destination point. Using `φ1` instead of `φ2` would cause the destination point to be calculated at the same latitude as the starting point, resulting in a different distance and bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` is the longitude of the starting point, while `λ2` is the longitude of the destination point. Using `λ1` instead of `λ2` would cause the destination point to be calculated at the same longitude as the starting point, resulting in a different distance and bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, while `φ2` and `λ2`
