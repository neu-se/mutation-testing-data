  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the result of the `read` function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `read` function to be called with `null` as the callback function, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the result of the `read` function. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `read` function to be called with `undefined` as the callback function, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the result of the `read` function. Replacing it with an empty function
