  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.insert.length` returns the length of the string in the `insert` property of `baseOp`, while `baseOp` returns the entire `Op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.retain.length` returns the length of the string in the `retain` property of `baseOp`, while `baseOp` returns the entire `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.insert.length + 1` returns the length of the string in the `insert` property of `baseOp` plus 1, while `baseOp` returns the entire `Op` object.

DONE.
