  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `verb` string to lowercase, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `verb` string to uppercase, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the `verb` string starting from the second character, which may not be intended.

DONE.
