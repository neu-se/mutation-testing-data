  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce a different error message for invalid wildcards.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

      ? /[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/

```
This would result in different behavior because it would not throw an error at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!spec.match(version === '
