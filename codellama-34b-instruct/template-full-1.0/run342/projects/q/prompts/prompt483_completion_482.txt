  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.prototype.splice()` method is called with the wrong second argument (0 instead of 1). As a result, the wrong number of elements would be removed from the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.prototype.splice()` method is called with the wrong second argument (-1 instead of 1). As a result, the wrong number of elements would be removed from the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, unhandledRejections.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.prototype.splice()` method is called with the wrong second argument (unhandledRejections.length - 2 instead of 1). As a result, the wrong number of elements would be removed from the
