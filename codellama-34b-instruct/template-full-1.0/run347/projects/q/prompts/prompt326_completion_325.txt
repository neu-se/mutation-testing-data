  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation would always be "1" instead of the actual operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation would always be the string "foo" instead of the actual operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation would always be undefined instead of the actual operation.

DONE.
