  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.push(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a new Op object to the `arg` array, potentially modifying the original delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first Op object from the `arg` array, potentially modifying the original delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last Op object from the `arg` array, potentially modifying the original delta.

DONE.
