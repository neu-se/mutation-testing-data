  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(null)` is a resolved promise with a value of `null`, whereas the original code fragment `Q.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is a resolved promise with a value of `<PLACEHOLDER>`, which is a placeholder for a value that has not been specified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("something went wrong"));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(new Error("something went wrong"))` is a rejected promise with an error message of "something went wrong", whereas the original code fragment `Q.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is a resolved promise with a value of `<PLACEHOLDER>`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all([])` is a promise
