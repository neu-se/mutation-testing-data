  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `cb` function is not called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `function () {}` function is not called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value is not the same as the `end` variable, and the `function () {}` function is not called with the correct arguments.

DONE.
