  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on `null` instead of the object, which would likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on `undefined` instead of the object, which would likely throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method on the promise returned by `Q(object)` instead of the `dispatch` method on the object itself. This could potentially lead to different behavior if the promise is resolved to a different object or if the `dispatch` method has been overridden on the promise.

DONE.
