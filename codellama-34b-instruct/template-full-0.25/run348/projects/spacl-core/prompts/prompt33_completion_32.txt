  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `for...of` loop to iterate over the array returned by `spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()`, but this new code fragment is only accessing the first element of the array using bracket notation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[1];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `for...of` loop to iterate over the array returned by `spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()`, but this new code fragment is only accessing the second element of the array using bracket notation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[2];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `
