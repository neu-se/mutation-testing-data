  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `shouldThrow`, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if `shouldThrow` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND operator, and `false` is a boolean value that always evaluates to `false`. So the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, even if `shouldThrow` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR operator, and `true` is a boolean value that always evaluates to `true`. So the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if `shouldThrow` is `false`.

DONE.
