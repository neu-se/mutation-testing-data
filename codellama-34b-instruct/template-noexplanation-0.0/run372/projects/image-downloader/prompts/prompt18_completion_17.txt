  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, basename
```
This change will cause the `path.basename` function to be called on the `options.dest` variable, which is not a string, and will result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, pathname
```
This change will cause the `path.basename` function to be called on the `options.dest` variable, which is not a string, and will result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, url.pathname
```
This change will cause the `path.basename` function to be called on the `options.dest` variable, which is not a string, and will result in an error.

DONE.
