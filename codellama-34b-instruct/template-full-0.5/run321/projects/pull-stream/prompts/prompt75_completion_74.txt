  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated first, and the result would be `done` if `done` is truthy, or `function () {}` if `done` is falsy. In the original code, the `||` operator has higher precedence, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated only if `done` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done ? function () {} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `? :` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated first, and the result would be `done` if `done` is truthy, or `null` if `done` is falsy. In the original code, the `||` operator has higher precedence, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated only if
