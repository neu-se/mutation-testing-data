  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to be advanced, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter` to be advanced, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter` and `otherIter` to be advanced simultaneously, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
