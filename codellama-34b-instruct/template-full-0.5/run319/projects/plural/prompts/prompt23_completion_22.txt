  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends the string "i" to the end of the input word, while this new code fragment appends the string "es" to the end of the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends the string "i" to the end of the input word, while this new code fragment appends the string "us" to the end of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends the string "i"
