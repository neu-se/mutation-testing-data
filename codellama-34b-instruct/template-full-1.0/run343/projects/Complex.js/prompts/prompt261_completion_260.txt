  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` directly, while this option multiply `b` by `Math.PI`, which would cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` directly, while this option adds `Math.PI` to `b`, which would cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b/Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` directly, while this option divides `b` by `Math.PI`, which would cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
