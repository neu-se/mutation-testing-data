  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a raw string, which would not be interpreted as a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a carriage return followed by a newline character, which would be interpreted as a newline character on Windows systems.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\u2028"
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a Unicode line separator character, which would be interpreted as a newline character in some contexts.

DONE.
