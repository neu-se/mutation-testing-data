  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
el.contents()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.text()` returns the text content of an element, whereas `.contents()` returns the child elements of an element. This would change the value of the `text` variable, which is used later in the code to check if a link is internal or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(el).children()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.children()` returns the child elements of an element, whereas `.text()` returns the text content of an element. This would change the value of the `text` variable, which is used later in the code to check if a link is internal or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(el).previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.previous()` returns the previous element, whereas `.text()` returns the text content of an element. This would change the value of the `text` variable, which is used later in the code to check if a
