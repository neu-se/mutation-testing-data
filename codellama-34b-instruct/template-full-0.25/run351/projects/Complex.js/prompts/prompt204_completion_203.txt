  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 1 from the complex number, while this replacement would be adding 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 1 from the complex number, while this replacement would be subtracting 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 1 from the complex number, while this replacement would be multiplying the imaginary part of the complex number by 2.

DONE.
