  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `string` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `slice` method to extract a substring from the `string` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.substring(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `string` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `substring` method to extract a substring from the `string` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.substr(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `string` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `substr` method to extract a substring from the `string` variable.

DONE.
