  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the attributes of the last operation to the new operation, rather than merging them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = Object.assign({}, lastOp.attributes, newOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge the attributes of the last operation with the new operation, rather than replacing them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = newOp.attributes || lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the new operation if they are defined, or the attributes of the last operation if they are not defined.

DONE.
