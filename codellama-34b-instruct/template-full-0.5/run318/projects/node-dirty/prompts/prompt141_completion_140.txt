  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'warn' is a different event type than 'error', and the event handler for 'warn' is not defined in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'foo' is not a valid event type, and the event handler for 'foo' is not defined in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not a valid event type, and the event handler for null is not defined in the code.

DONE.
