  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments that would result in different behavior than the original code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.log```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log()` computes the natural logarithm of a number, while `Math.pow()` computes the power of a number. Using `Math.log()` instead of `Math.pow()` would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.sqrt```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt()` computes the square root of a number, while `Math.pow()` computes the power of a number. Using `Math.sqrt()` instead of `Math.pow()` would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.random()```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, while `Math.pow()` computes
