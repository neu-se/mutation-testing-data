  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(arg, priority);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(arg, !priority);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(arg, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
