  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to `a['arg']` would change the value of the argument passed to the `sin` function, which would in turn change the output of the `logHypot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `b` is never used in the `logHypot` function, so changing the value of `a['arg']` to `b` would have no effect on the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] * 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `a['arg']` by 0.5 would change the value of the argument passed to the `sin` function, which would in turn change the output of the `logHypot` function.

DONE.
