  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with real and imaginary parts, while this code returns a special value representing Not-a-Number (NaN).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with real and imaginary parts, while this code returns a special value representing Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with real and imaginary parts, while this code returns a special value representing Zero.

DONE.
