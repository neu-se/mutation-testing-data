  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would be called with the `promise` object as the `this` context, whereas the original code fragment would call the `fallback` function with the `promise` object as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would be called with the `promise` object as the `this` context and an empty array of arguments, whereas the original code fragment would call the `fallback` function with the `promise` object as the first argument and an array of arguments containing the `op` and `args` parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would be called with the `promise` object as the `this` context and an empty array of arguments, whereas the original
