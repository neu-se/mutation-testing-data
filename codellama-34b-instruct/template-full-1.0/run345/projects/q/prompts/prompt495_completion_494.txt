  Sure, here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(promise, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would be called with a promise that is already resolved, which would not be considered an unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with a promise that is already resolved, which would remove it from the list of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (promise.state === "rejected") {
    untrackRejection(promise, reason);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would only be called if the promise is in the "rejected" state, which would ensure that only rejected promises are
