  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `embedType` is a key in `otherData`, regardless of the value of `embedType`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType in otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `embedType` is a key in `otherData`, but it would also return `true` if `embedType` is a value in `otherData`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(otherData).includes(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `embedType` is a key in `otherData`, but it would also return `true` if `embedType` is a value in `otherData`.

DONE.
