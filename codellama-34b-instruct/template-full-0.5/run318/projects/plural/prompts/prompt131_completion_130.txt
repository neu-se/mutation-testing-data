  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `exec()` returns an array of matches, while `test()` returns a boolean indicating whether there is a match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].match(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match()` returns an array of matches, while `test()` returns a boolean indicating whether there is a match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.match(rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because `match()` is called on the `word` string instead of the `rule[0]` regular expression.

DONE.
