  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
BigInt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because BigInt(b) forces the value of b to be treated as a Big integer, which may result in a different value than the original `b` retrieved from the Complex object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b^2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square of b, rather than the value of b itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of b to 0, rather than returning the value of b itself.

DONE.
