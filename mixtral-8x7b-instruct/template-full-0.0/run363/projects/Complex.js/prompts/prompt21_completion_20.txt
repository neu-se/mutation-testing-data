 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an unnecessary multiplication operation, which would not affect the result in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.SQRT2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.SQRT2` is a specific constant value (approximately 1.4142135623730951), while `Math.sqrt` is a function for calculating the square root of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.hypot
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.hypot` calculates the square root of the sum of squares of its arguments, which is not equivalent to the original `Math.sqrt` usage in this context.

DONE.
