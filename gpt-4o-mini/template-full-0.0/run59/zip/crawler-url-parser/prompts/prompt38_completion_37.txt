Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the parsing options to not use the `parseQueryString` and `slashesDenoteHost` options, which may lead to incorrect parsing of the URL and loss of query parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses `baseUrlStr` instead of `currentUrlStr`, which would lead to parsing the base URL instead of the current URL, resulting in incorrect URL resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr + 'invalid', true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because appending 'invalid' to `currentUrlStr` would create an invalid URL, which could cause the parsing to fail or produce unexpected results, leading to a null return value.

DONE.
