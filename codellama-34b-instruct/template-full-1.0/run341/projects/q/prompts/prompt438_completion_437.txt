  Sure, here are three possible answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a value that is treated as "not a number" in JavaScript, and using it in the `indexOf` function would cause the function to always return `-1`, regardless of whether the value is present in the array or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a value that is used to represent the absence of a value in JavaScript, and using it in the `indexOf` function would cause the function to always return `-1`, regardless of whether the value is present in the array or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that is used to represent an undefined or uninitialized variable in JavaScript, and using it in the `indexOf` function would cause the function to always return `-1`, regardless of whether the value is present
