  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(requestPortTick, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `requestPortTick` asynchronously, which is not the same as calling it directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately throw an error, rather than waiting until the end of the function to throw one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick.bind(this)();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `requestPortTick` with the same `this` value as the surrounding `requestTick` function, rather than using the default `this` value.

DONE.
