  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx` parameter is now `null`, which may cause the `matches` method to behave differently, potentially allowing or denying access to the path when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx.parent)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx` parameter is now the parent of the original `ctx`, which may cause the `matches` method to behave differently, potentially allowing or denying access to the path when it should not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx` parameter is now a clone of the original `ctx`, which may cause the `matches` method to behave differently, potentially allowing or denying access to the path when it should not.

DONE.
