  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the `this` and `that` objects would be reversed, which could affect the logic of the code that uses them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[Q.resolve(this), Q.resolve(that)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve()` function would return a promise that resolves to the `this` and `that` objects, which could affect the logic of the code that uses them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this.value, that.value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.value` property would be accessed on the `this` and `that` objects, which could affect the logic of the code that uses them.

DONE.
