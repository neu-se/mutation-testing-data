  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a variable that is only defined when the promise is resolved, so checking if it is `undefined` would cause the `inspect` method to return a different value when the promise is pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages` is an array that is only populated when the promise is pending, so checking its length would cause the `inspect` method to return a different value when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.longStackSupport` is a flag that controls whether or not long stack traces are enabled, so checking if it is `false` would cause the `inspect` method to return a different value when long stack traces are enabled.

DONE.
