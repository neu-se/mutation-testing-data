  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the value passed to `thenResolve`, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the value returned by the `thenResolve` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that rejects with the reason passed to `thenReject`, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that rejects with the reason returned by the `thenReject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function () { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the value passed to `then`, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the value returned by the `then
