 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
self.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the success callback would be called instead of the error callback when an error is passed to the Node-style callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the Node-style callback would not have any effect, as it would not call either the success or error callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('My Error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with a new error, regardless of the input passed to the Node-style callback.

DONE.
