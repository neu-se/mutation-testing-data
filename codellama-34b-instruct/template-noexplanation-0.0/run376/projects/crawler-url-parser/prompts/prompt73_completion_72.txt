  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This change will cause the code to extract the `src` attribute from the `<base>` element instead of the `href` attribute, which may result in different behavior depending on the HTML structure of the input data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' + 'src'
```
This change will cause the code to extract the concatenation of the `href` and `src` attributes from the `<base>` element, which may also result in different behavior depending on the HTML structure of the input data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' + 'src' + 'alt'
```
This change will cause the code to extract the concatenation of the `href`, `src`, and `alt` attributes from the `<base>` element, which may also result in different behavior depending on the HTML structure of the input data.

DONE.
