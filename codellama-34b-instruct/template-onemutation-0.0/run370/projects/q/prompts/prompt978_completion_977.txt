  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise with the error, while the modified code fragment also tries to resolve the promise with the result of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which is a function that returns a promise. This would cause the promise to be resolved with a function instead of the expected error, which would lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
