  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value).then(function (result) {
    return result;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that is resolved with the result of the original promise, instead of the original promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value).then(function (result) {
    return result;
}, function (error) {
    return error;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that is resolved with the result of the original promise, or rejected with the error of the original promise, instead of the original promise itself.

DONE.
