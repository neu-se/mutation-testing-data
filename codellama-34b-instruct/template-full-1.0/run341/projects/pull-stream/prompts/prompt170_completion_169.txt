  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with `false` instead of `true`, which could break the code that relies on the callback being called with `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++]++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with the incremented value of `array[i++]` instead of the original value, which could break the code that relies on the callback being called with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
delete array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with the original value of `array[i++]`, but then the `array[i++]` would be deleted, which could break the code that relies on the `array[i++]` to be present.
