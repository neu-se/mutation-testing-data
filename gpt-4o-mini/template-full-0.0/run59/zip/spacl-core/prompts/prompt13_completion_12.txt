Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+:|:\/|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows for one or more characters before a colon, which could incorrectly validate paths that should be considered malformed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]*:|:\/|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows for zero or more characters before a colon, potentially allowing empty captures which should be invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/|:/
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows paths that end with a colon, which should not be valid according to the original specification.

DONE.
