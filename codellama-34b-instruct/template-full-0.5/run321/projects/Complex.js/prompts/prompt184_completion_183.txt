  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is greater than 0 or `b` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is
