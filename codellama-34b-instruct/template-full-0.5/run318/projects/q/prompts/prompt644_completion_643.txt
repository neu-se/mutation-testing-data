  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will immediately reject the promise, whereas `Q` is a promise that will eventually be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` will immediately resolve the promise, whereas `Q` is a promise that will eventually be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function() { return Q.reject(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then()` will schedule a callback function to be executed after the promise is resolved, and the callback function will return a rejected promise.

DONE.
