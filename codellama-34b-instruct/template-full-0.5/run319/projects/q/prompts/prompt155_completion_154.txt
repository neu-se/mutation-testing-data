  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the concatenated stack trace into an array of strings, rather than a single string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace of the promise into an array of strings, rather than concatenating it with the stack trace of the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace of the error into an array of strings, rather than concatenating it with the stack trace of the promise.

DONE.
