  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code, which is `x`. The function will now return `x + 1` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code, which is `x`. The function will now return `x - 1` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code, which is `x`. The function will now return `x * 2` instead.

DONE.
