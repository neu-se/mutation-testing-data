 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function is used in the original code to create a deferred object, while `Promise.resolve()` immediately creates a resolved promise. This change would cause the `any()` function to resolve immediately, instead of waiting for the input promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject('Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject('Error')` creates a rejected promise with the error message 'Error', while `Q.defer()` creates a deferred object. This change would cause the `any()` function to reject immediately with the error message 'Error', instead of waiting for the input promises to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function returns an object with `resolve`, `reject`, and `promise` properties
