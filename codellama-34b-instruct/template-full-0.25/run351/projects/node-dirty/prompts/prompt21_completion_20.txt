  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `this._queue` to `cbs`, which is a list of callbacks, instead of setting it to `val`, which is the value to be stored in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `this._queue` to an empty array, instead of setting it to `val`, which is the value to be stored in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `this._queue` to `null`, instead of setting it to `val`, which is the value to be stored in the database.

DONE.
