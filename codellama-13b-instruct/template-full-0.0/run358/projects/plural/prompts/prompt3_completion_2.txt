  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return "ies" instead of "s" for words that end in "y".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-3
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return "ies" instead of "s" for words that end in "y".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-4
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return "ies" instead of "s" for words that end in "y".

DONE.
