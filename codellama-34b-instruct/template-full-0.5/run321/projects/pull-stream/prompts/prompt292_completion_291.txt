  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value would cause the `unique` function to always return `false`, regardless of whether the item has been seen before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, !true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!true` value would cause the `unique` function to always return `false`, regardless of whether the item has been seen before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` value would cause the `unique` function to always return `false`, regardless of whether the item has been seen before.

DONE.
