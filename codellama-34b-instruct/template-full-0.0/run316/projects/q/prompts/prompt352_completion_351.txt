  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, and it is likely that the intention was to call the `reject` method of the `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, and it is likely that the intention was to call the `resolve` method of the `Promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, and it is likely that the intention was to call the `reject` method of the `Promise` object.

DONE.
