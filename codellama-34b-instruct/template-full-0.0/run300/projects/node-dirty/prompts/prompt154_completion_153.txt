  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `this._writeStream.uncork(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which would pass the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>` to the `uncork` method. However, the new code fragment would always pass `false` to the `uncork` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `this._writeStream.uncork(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which would pass the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>` to the `uncork` method. However, the new code fragment would always pass `true` to the `uncork` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.
