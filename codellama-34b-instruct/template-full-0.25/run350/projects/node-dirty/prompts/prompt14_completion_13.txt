  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only pushes the callback to the list of callbacks if the key is not already in the queue, while this modified code fragment would push the callback to the list of callbacks regardless of whether the key is already in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.unshift(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the callback to the end of the list of callbacks, while this modified code fragment would push the callback to the beginning of the list of callbacks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.splice(0, 0, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only pushes the callback to the list of callbacks if the key is not already in the queue, while this modified code fragment would push the callback to the list of callbacks regardless of whether the key
