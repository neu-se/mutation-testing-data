  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the point object has the 'type' and 'coordinates' properties, while this modified code checks if the point object has both properties and if they are not null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the point object has the 'type' and 'coordinates' properties, while this modified code checks if the point object has the 'type' property with the value 'Point' and if the 'coordinates' property is an array with 2 elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0] === point.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the point object has the
