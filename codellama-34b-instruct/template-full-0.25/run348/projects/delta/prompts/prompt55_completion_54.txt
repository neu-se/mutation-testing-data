  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `Array.isArray`, causing the code to execute the `if` block when `ops` is not an array, rather than when it is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.isArray` function would be called with `ops` as an argument, which would cause the code to execute the `if` block when `ops` is an array, rather than when it is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `ops` would be checked, which would cause the code to execute the `if` block when `ops` is an empty array, rather than when it is not an array.

DONE.
