  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on `null` instead of `window`, which would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a bound function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on `undefined` instead of `window`, which would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a bound function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on an object instead of `window`, which would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a bound function.

DONE.
