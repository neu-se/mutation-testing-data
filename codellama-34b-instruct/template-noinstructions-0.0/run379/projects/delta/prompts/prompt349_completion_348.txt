  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the base operation, which is not the intended behavior of the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(baseOp.attributes, op.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the base operation, which is not the intended behavior of the `invert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, op.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the operation, which is not the intended behavior of the `invert` method.

DONE.
