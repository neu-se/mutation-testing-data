  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument of 1 would change the behavior of the array_map function.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q, promises
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument of promises would change the behavior of the array_map function.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
[], Q
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty array would not iterate like the promises array, causing the when function to never be called.

DONE.
