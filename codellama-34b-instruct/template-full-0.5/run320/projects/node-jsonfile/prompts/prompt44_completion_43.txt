  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is not the same as `options`, and it would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding = 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the encoding to 'utf8' instead of using the default encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to not throw an error if the file cannot be read.

DONE.
