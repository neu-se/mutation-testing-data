  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of values of the object's properties, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of keys of the object's properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f => f.a
```
This would result in different behavior because `f => f.a` is a function that returns the value of the property `a` for a given function argument `f`, whereas `Object.keys` is a function that returns an array of keys of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that logs a message to the console, whereas `Object.keys` is a function that returns an array of keys of an object.

DONE.
