  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `define` is a function that is only defined when a module loader is present, so if we replace the original code with this, it will cause the code to execute the `else` block, which is intended for the case where a module loader is not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define.amd === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `amd` property of the `define` function is undefined, which is not the case when it is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `define` function is not a function, which is not the case when it is defined.

DONE.
