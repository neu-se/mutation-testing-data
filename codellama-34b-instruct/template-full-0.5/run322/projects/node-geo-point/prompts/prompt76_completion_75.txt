  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor` function would round the value of `θ` down to the nearest integer, which would result in a different bearing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.ceil` function would round the value of `θ` up to the nearest integer, which would result in a different bearing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.random` function would generate a random number between 0 and 1, which would be multiplied by 360 to produce a random bearing value.

DONE.
