  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the latitude and longitude values, potentially causing the calculated distance to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + point.latitude, this.longitude + point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitude and longitude values together, potentially causing the calculated distance to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * point.latitude, this.longitude * point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the latitude and longitude values together, potentially causing the calculated distance to be incorrect.

DONE.
