  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace("at ", "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove the "at " substring from the beginning of the `stackLine`, which would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to fail to extract the file name and line number from the stack trace.
