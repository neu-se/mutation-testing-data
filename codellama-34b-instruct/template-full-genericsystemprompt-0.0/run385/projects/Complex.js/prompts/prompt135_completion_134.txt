  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if both are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']() || this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if either is infinite or if `this` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']() || this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if either is infinite or if `this` is NaN.

DONE.
