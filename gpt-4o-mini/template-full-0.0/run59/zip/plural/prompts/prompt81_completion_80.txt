Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly pluralizes "goose" as "gooses" instead of the correct "geese".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'goos'
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the pluralization rule entirely, resulting in an incorrect plural form of "goose".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'geesee'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an extra 'e' at the end of the plural form, making it an incorrect pluralization of "goose".

DONE.
