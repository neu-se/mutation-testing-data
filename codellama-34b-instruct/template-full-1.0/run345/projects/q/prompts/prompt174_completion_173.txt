  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would iterate one fewer times, potentially skipping over some important logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would iterate one additional time, potentially causing the code to execute unnecessary logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would start from the wrong index, potentially causing the code to access the wrong values in the loop.

DONE.
