  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is missing a plural 's' on the word 'ices'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is splitting on the word's length, while the new code fragment is reversing the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `substr` method to remove the last character, while the new code fragment is using the `substring` method, which does not remove the last character.

DONE.
