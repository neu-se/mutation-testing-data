  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.map(function(x) { return x; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. In this case, the function does not modify the elements, so the resulting array would be the same as the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.filter(function(x) { return x; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array with the elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the function always returns `true`, so the resulting array would be the same as the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.reduce(function(acc, x) { return acc + x; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to
