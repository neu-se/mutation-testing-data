  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'z'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the next token is equal to the letter 'z' instead of 'i' or 'I'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the next token is equal to the letter 'I' instead of 'i' or 'I'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the next token is equal to the plus sign instead of 'i' or 'I'.

DONE.
