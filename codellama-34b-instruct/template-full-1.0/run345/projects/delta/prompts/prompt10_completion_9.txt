  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different object from `a`, and its properties may not be equivalent to `a`'s.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` would result in the concatenation of `a` and `b`, rather than the merge of their properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[a]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[a]` would attempt to access the property `a` of object `b`, rather than merging the properties of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
