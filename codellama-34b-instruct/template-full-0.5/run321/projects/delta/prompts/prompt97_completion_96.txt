  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with the index `1`, which would insert the new element at the second position of the array, instead of at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with the index `-1`, which would insert the new element at the last position of the array, instead of at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with the index `this.ops.length - 1`, which would insert the new element at the last position of the array, instead of at the end.

DONE.
