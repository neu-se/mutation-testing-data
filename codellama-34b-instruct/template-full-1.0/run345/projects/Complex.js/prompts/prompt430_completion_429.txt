  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.ceil rounds up to the nearest integer, while Math.round rounds up to the nearest integer or down to the nearest integer, depending on the number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.ceil returns the input value if it is already an integer, while Math.abs returns the absolute value of the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.imul
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.ceil uses the standard IEEE 754 rounding rules, while Math.imul implements the multiply and round operation.

In conclusion, each of these options will cause different behavior in the ceil function, but they have different reasoning. The first option will cause the function to round up to the nearest integer or down for negative integers, while the second option will cause the function to always return an integer, and the
