  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.concat('s') }
```
This would result in different behavior becauseconcat_writer does not modify the original string, but instead returns a new string with the concatenated result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + w }
```
This would result in different behavior because it duplicates the input string, causing the output to be twice as long as the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it capitalizes the input string before appending "s," causing the output to be in all caps.

DONE.
