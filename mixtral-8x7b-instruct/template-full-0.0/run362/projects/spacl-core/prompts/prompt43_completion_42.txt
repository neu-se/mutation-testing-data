 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
flatten();
```
This would result in different behavior because it will immediately call the `flatten` function without any arguments, which might cause unexpected behavior or errors depending on the context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
flatten(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it will force the `flatten` function to be called with the `final` argument set to `true`, which might cause the function to behave differently than intended, especially if the function relies on the default value of `final` in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
const savedFlatten = flatten;
flatten = () => savedFlatten(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it will replace the `flatten` function with a new function that always calls the original `flatten` function with the `final` argument set to `true`. This might cause the function to behave differently than intended
