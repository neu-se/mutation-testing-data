  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.on
```
This would result in different behavior because `on` is a method that sets up an event listener, whereas `once` is a method that sets up a one-time event listener. Using `on` instead of `once` would cause the `drain` event to be triggered multiple times, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` is a method that triggers an event, whereas `once` is a method that sets up a one-time event listener. Using `emit` instead of `once` would cause the `drain` event to be triggered immediately, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `off` is a method that removes an event listener, whereas `once` is a method that sets up a one-time event listener.
