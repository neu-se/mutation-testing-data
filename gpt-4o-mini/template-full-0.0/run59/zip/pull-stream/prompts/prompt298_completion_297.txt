Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the callback to be called with `false`, indicating an error or termination, regardless of the actual state of `ended`, which may lead to incorrect handling of the end condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback with the current value of `ended`, which may not accurately reflect the intended termination state, potentially causing the function to behave incorrectly based on the previous state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `terminate` function directly, which may lead to premature termination of the reading process, bypassing the intended logic that checks the `last` condition.

DONE.
