  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `EOL` constant, which is platform-dependent, while this replacement uses the Windows-specific newline sequence `\r\n`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `EOL` constant, which is platform-dependent, while this replacement uses an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `EOL` constant, which is platform-dependent, while this replacement uses a single space.

DONE.
