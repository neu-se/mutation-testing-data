  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Buggy code");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error message, whereas the original code fragment would have resolved the promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Buggy code"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error message, whereas the original code fragment would have resolved the promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(new Error("Buggy code"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the given error message, whereas the original code fragment would have resolved the promise with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
