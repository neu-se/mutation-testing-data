  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function expects a function as its argument, but `null` is not a function and will cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function expects a function as its argument, but the anonymous function provided as a placeholder does not have any side effects and will not cause the `flush` function to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function expects a function as its argument, and the `flush` function is a valid function that will be called when the `requestTick` function is invoked.

DONE.
