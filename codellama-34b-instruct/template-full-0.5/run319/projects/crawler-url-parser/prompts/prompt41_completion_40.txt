  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would cause the hostname to be parsed as a directory, which could result in a different URL being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `query` parameter would cause the query string to be excluded from the parsed URL, which could result in a different URL being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value for the `search` parameter would cause the search string to be included in the parsed URL, which could result in a different URL being returned.

DONE.
