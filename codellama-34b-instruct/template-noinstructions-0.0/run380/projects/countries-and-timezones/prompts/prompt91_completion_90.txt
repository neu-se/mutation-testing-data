  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the given ID, but with all timezones, including deprecated ones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { deprecated: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the given ID, but with all timezones, excluding deprecated ones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the given ID, but with all timezones, including deprecated ones, and without any filtering.

DONE.
