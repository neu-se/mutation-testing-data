  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the string returned by `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)` from the beginning to the end, while this replacement slices the string from the beginning to the first character. This would cause the function to return a different value for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the string returned by `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)` from the beginning to the end, while this replacement slices the string from the second character to the end. This would cause the function to return a different value for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior
