  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `insert` property is not null, while this replacement checks if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `insert` property is not null, while this replacement checks if it is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `insert` property is not null, while this replacement checks if it is not the string 'null'.

DONE.
