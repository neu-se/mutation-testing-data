  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1.1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if `b` was equal to `-1`, but the replacement code is checking if `b` is equal to `1.1`, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1.1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if `b` was equal to `-1`, but the replacement code is checking if `b` is not equal to `1.1`, which is a different condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if `b` was equal to `-1`, but the replacement code is checking if `b` is equal to `0`, which is a different value.

DONE.
