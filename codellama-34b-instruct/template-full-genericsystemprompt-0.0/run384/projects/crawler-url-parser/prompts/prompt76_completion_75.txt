  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseUrlStr` as the second argument to the `parse` function, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass the `baseUrlStr` as an argument to the `parse` function, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the `parse` function, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
