  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.compose(other);
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the `compose` method is calling itself recursively without any base case to stop the recursion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return other.compose(this);
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the `compose` method is calling itself recursively without any base case to stop the recursion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Delta();
```
This would result in an empty delta being returned, which would likely cause unexpected behavior in the calling code.

DONE.
