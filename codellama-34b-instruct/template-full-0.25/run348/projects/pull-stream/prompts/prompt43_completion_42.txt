  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice()` returns a new array, while `ref` returns the original array. This could cause the `pull` function to behave differently when it is called with a different number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.concat()` returns a new array, while `ref` returns the original array. This could cause the `pull` function to behave differently when it is called with a different number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice(1)` returns a new array that is a subset of the original array, while `ref` returns the original array. This could cause the `pull` function to behave differently when it is called with a different number of arguments.

DONE.
