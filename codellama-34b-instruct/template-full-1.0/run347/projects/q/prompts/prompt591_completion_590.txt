  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because `some` returns `true` if any element in the array passes the test, whereas `all` returns `true` only if all elements pass the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!all
```
This would result in different behavior because `!all` would invert the result of `all` and return `true` if any element in the array fails the test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].every(v => v === arguments[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check every element in the arguments array and return `true` only if they are all equal.

DONE.
