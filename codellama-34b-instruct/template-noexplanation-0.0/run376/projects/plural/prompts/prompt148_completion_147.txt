  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This change will cause the `plural` function to return a lowercase version of the input word, rather than the original word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This change will cause the `plural` function to return an uppercase version of the input word, rather than the original word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This change will cause the `plural` function to return the input word with its letters reversed, rather than the original word.

DONE.
