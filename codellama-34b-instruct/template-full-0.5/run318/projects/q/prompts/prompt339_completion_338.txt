  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with the `promise` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with the `resolve` function, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
