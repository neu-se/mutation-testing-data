  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `this['isInfinite']`, so the code would behave as if the number is not infinite, even if it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite()` checks if a number is finite, whereas `isInfinite()` checks if a number is infinite. So, the code would behave as if the number is finite, even if it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks if a number is not a number, whereas `isInfinite()` checks if a number is infinite. So, the code would behave as if the number is not a number, even if it is infinite.

DONE.
