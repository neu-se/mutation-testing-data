  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` would return the next element in the iteration, whereas `iter.next` would return the `next` method itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(1)` would return the next element in the iteration, whereas `iter.next` would return the `next` method itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(2)` would return the next two elements in the iteration, whereas `iter.next` would return the `next` method itself.

DONE.
