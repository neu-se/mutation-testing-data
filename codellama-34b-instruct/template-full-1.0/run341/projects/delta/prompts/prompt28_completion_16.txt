  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property values, while `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable [key, value] pairs, while `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` returns a new object created by copying all enumerable own properties of one or more source objects to a target object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property keys.

DONE.
