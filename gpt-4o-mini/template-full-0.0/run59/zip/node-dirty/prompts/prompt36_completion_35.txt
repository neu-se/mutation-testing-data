Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key] = this._data;
```
This would result in different behavior because it only destructures the first element of the `_data` Map, ignoring the corresponding value and potentially leading to incorrect behavior in the `forEach` loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.entries()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `entries()` method, which returns an iterator of key-value pairs, but if the `forEach` function is expected to work with a different structure, it may lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.keys()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it only iterates over the keys of the `_data` Map, completely omitting the values, which would break the intended functionality of the `forEach` method that relies on both keys and values.

DONE.
