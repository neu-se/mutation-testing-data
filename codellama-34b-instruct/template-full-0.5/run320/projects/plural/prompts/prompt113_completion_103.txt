  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trousers
```
This would result in different behavior because "trousers" is not a valid word in the English language, and the plural function would not be able to recognize it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pants
```
This would result in different behavior because "pants" is not a valid word in the English language, and the plural function would not be able to recognize it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
panties
```
This would result in different behavior because "panties" is not a valid word in the English language, and the plural function would not be able to recognize it.

DONE.
