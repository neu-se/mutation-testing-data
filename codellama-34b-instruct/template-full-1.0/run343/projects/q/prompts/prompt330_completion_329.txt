  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, while `exception` is a variable that is expected to hold an error object. Using `{}` would cause the `reject` function to be called with an empty object, which would likely result in a validation error or a different type of exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value, while `exception` is an object that is expected to hold an error object. Using `null` would cause the `reject` function to be called with `null`, which would likely result in a null reference exception or a different type of exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(null)` creates an object that has no prototype, which means that it does not inherit any properties from `Object
