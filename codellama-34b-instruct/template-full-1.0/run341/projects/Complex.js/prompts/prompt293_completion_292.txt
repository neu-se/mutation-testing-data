  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a constant expression that always evaluates to 1, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the value of `b`, which can change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b;
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of `b`, which can affect the result of the calculation.

DONE.
