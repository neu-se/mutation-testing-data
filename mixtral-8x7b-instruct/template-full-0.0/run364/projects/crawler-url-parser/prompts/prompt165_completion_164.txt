 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.replace(/[^\/]*$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last path segment instead of checking if the URLs are on the same level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.slice(0, -1);
