  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is not being used to filter the elements, instead it is being used to combine the elements into a single value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum - curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is not being used to filter the elements, instead it is being used to subtract the elements from each other.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum * curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is not being used to filter the elements, instead it is being used to multiply the elements together.

DONE.
