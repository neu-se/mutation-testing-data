  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("=").length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the search string into an array of substrings, and then returns the length of the array minus one. However, this code fragment uses the `split` method with a different argument, which would result in a different array of substrings, and therefore a different length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("=").length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the search string into an array of substrings, and then returns the length of the array minus one. However, this code fragment uses the `split` method with the same argument, but does not subtract one from the length of the array. Therefore, the result of this code fragment would be one greater than the result of the original code fragment.
