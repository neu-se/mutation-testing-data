  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This will cause the `zip` function to compress a single file instead of a directory, which is a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, true)
```
This will cause the `zip` function to compress the directory and all its contents, including hidden files and directories, which is a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, false, {
    ignore: (file) => file.isDirectory()
})
```
This will cause the `zip` function to compress the directory and all its contents, except for any subdirectories, which is a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
