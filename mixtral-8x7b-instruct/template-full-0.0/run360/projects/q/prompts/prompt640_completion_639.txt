 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` inside the `post` method might not refer to the correct object, unlike `Q(object)` which ensures that the correct object is being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.dispatch` is a static method and would not have access to the instance properties of the promise, unlike `Q(object).dispatch` which has access to the instance properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.prototype.dispatch
