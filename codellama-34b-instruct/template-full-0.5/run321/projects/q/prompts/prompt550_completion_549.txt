  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` method is used to create a rejected promise, whereas the original code used `Q` to create a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve` method is used to create a fulfilled promise, whereas the original code used `Q` to create a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer` method is used to create a deferred object, whereas the original code used `Q` to create a promise.

DONE.
