  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `requestTick` method, unlike the `process` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because "string" is a primitive value that does not have a `requestTick` method, unlike the `process` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Buffer` is a built-in `Object` in Node.js and does not have a `requestTick` method, unlike the `process` object.

DONE.
