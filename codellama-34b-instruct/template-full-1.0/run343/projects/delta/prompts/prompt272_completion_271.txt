  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to exit early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to exit early when the next operation is not an insert.

DONE.
