  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === null
```
This code fragment checks if the `plural` property of the `String.prototype` object is null, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === undefined
```
This code fragment checks if the `plural` property of the `String.prototype` object is undefined, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === 'undefined'
```
This code fragment checks if the `plural` property of the `String.prototype` object is the string `'undefined'`, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
