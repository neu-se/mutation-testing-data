  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is not null, but `null` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is not null, but `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is not null, but `0` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would not be executed.

DONE.
