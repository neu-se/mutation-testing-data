  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is not called, and the `newOp` is not added to the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is not called, and the `newOp` is not added to the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift` method is called instead of `push`, and the `newOp` is added to the beginning of the `ops` array instead of the end.

DONE.
