  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function that takes an error as an argument, while `resolved` is a function that takes a value as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function that takes an error as an argument, while `rejected(new Error("error"))` is a function that takes an error object as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function that takes an error as an argument, while `rejected(promise)` is a function that takes a promise as an argument.

DONE.
