  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.push()` method would receive a null value instead of a task, which would cause the `flush()` method to not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.push()` method would receive an undefined value instead of a task, which would cause the `flush()` method to not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.push()` method would receive a zero value instead of a task, which would cause the `flush()` method to not be called.

DONE.
