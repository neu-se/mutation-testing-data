  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'img'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was selecting all anchor tags, while the new code fragment is only selecting image tags.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a[href]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was selecting all anchor tags, while the new code fragment is only selecting anchor tags with an href attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a[href^="http"]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was selecting all anchor tags, while the new code fragment is only selecting anchor tags with an href attribute that starts with "http".

DONE.
