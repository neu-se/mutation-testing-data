  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `stackLine.includes` always returns -1 if the input string is not found, while `stackLine.indexOf` returns -1 only if the input string is the empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `stackLine.search` always returns -1 if the input string is not found, while `stackLine.indexOf` returns the start position of the input string if it is found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `stackLine.lastIndexOf` returns the start position of the last occurrence of the input string, while `stackLine.indexOf` returns the start position of the first occurrence.

DONE.
