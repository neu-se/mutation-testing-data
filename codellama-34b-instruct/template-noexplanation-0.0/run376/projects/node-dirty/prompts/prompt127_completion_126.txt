  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && !this._waitForDrain
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment because it checks if the queue size is greater than 0 and the waitForDrain flag is false, whereas the original code fragment checks if the queue size is 0 or the waitForDrain flag is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment because it checks if the queue size is greater than 0 and the waitForDrain flag is false, whereas the original code fragment checks if the queue size is 0 or the waitForDrain flag is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0 || this._waitForDrain
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment because it checks if the queue size is 0 or the waitForD
