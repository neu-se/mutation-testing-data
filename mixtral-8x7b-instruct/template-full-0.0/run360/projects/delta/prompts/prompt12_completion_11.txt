 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a[key] !== null && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it now checks for null values in `a` instead of undefined, which might cause some cases to pass when they should fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a.hasOwnProperty(key) && b[key] === undefined
