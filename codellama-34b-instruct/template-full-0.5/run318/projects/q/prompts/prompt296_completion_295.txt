  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(y)` would return a promise that resolves to `y`, whereas `Q(x).join` would return a promise that resolves to the result of the `join` method called on `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(function(value) {
    return value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(x).then` would return a promise that resolves to the result of the callback function called on `x`, whereas `Q(x).join` would return a promise that resolves to the result of the `join` method called on `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).join(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(x).join(y)` would return a promise that resolves to the result of the `join` method called on `x` with
