  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` would advance the iterator to the next operation, which may not be the desired behavior in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek()` would return the next operation without advancing the iterator, which may not be the desired behavior in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the next operation without advancing the iterator, which may not be the desired behavior in this context.

DONE.
