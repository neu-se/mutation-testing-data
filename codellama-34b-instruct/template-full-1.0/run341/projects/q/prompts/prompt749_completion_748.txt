  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the result changes the overall value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the result changes the overall value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 changes the overall value.

DONE.
