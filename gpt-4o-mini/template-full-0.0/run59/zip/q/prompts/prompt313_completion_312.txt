Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.catch` is intended to handle rejected promises, while `this.then` is used for both fulfilled and rejected cases, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.resolve` is a method that resolves the promise, whereas `this.then` is used to attach callbacks for when the promise is fulfilled or rejected, which would disrupt the intended promise chaining.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.valueOf` returns the primitive value of the promise, which does not handle the fulfillment or rejection states, unlike `this.then`, which is designed to manage those states and execute the appropriate callbacks.

DONE.
