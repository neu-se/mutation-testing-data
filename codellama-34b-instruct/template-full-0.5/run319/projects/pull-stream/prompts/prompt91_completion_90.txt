  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator returns `false` if either operand is `false`, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator returns `true` if either operand is `true`, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

DONE.
