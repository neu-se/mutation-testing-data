  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, self, index, value
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the callback function is changed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, index, value, thisp
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the callback function is changed again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, index, thisp, self
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the callback function is changed again.

DONE.
