Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of invoking the `Q.onerror` handler, it simply logs the error to the console, which means that any custom error handling defined in `Q.onerror` would be bypassed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Unhandled promise rejection");
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a new error instead of calling the `Q.onerror` handler, which would prevent any existing error handling logic from executing and could lead to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `Q.onerror` handler to `null`, effectively disabling any error handling for unhandled promise rejections, which could lead to silent failures in the promise chain.

DONE.
