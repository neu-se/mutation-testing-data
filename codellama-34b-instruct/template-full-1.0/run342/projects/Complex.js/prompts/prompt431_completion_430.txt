  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the number of places instead of multiplying by it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] - places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the number of places instead of multiplying by it.

DONE.
