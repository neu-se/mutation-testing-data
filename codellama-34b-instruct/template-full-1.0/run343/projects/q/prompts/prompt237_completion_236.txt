  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!messages
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the `if` statement, causing the `if` block to be executed when `messages` is falsy, and the `else` block to be executed when `messages` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `messages` is equal to the primitive value `null`, rather than if `messages` is truthy or falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of `messages` is equal to 0, rather than if `messages` is truthy or falsy.

DONE.
