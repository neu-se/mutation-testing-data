  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid array literal, while the buggy code fragment is not. The original code fragment would result in a promise that resolves to an array with two elements, while the buggy code fragment would result in a promise that resolves to an array with one element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid array literal, while the buggy code fragment is not. The original code fragment would result in a promise that resolves to an array with two elements, while the buggy code fragment would result in a promise that resolves to an array with three elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

[key, value, key, value]

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid array literal, while the buggy code fragment is not. The original code
