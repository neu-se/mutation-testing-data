  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the result of the cosine function to be inverted, resulting in a different complex number being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the acos function returns the arccosine of its argument, which is the inverse of the cos function. In most cases, the result of the acos function will be different from the result of the cos function, resulting in a different complex number being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the tan function returns the tangent of its argument, which is related to but not equal to the cosine function. In most cases, the result of the tan function will be different from the result of the cos function, resulting in a different complex number being returned.

DONE.
