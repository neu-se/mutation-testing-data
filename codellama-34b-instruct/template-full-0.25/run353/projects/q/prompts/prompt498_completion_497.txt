  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra argument `1` would cause the `untrackRejection` function to fail, leading to the rejection being tracked even though it was handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra argument `null` would cause the `untrackRejection` function to fail, leading to the rejection being tracked even though it was handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra argument `undefined` would cause the `untrackRejection` function to fail, leading to the rejection being tracked even though it was handled.

DONE.
