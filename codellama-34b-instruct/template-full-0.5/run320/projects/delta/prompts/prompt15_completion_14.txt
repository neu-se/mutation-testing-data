  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is not undefined. If `a` is undefined, the original code fragment would return `b`, while this new code fragment would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is not null. If `a` is null, the original code fragment would return `b`, while this new code fragment would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is not the string 'object'. If `a` is the string '
