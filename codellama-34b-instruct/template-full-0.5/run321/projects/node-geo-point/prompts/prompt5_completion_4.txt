  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `point` is an object and has the properties `type` and `coordinates`, whereas this replacement would only check if `point` has the properties `type` and `coordinates`, without checking if it is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `point` is an object and has the properties `type` and `coordinates`, whereas this replacement would check if `point` does not have the properties `type` and `coordinates`, without checking if it is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would
