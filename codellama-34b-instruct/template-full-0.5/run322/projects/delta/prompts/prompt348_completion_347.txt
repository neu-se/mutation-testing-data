  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseOpData` variable is an array, and by accessing its first element, the code would be working with a different object than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseOpData` variable is an array, and by accessing its second element, the code would be working with a different object than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseOpData` variable is an array, and by accessing its `length` property, the code would be working with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
