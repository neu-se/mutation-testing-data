  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` variable is not guaranteed to have a `promise` property, whereas the original code fragment assumes that it does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is not guaranteed to return a promise, whereas the original code fragment assumes that it does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve` function is not guaranteed to return a promise, whereas the original code fragment assumes that it does.

DONE.
