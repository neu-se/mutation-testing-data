  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is true and `end` is false, while the modified code fragment checks if `ended` is true or `end` is false. This could potentially cause the test to pass when it should fail, or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is false and `end` is true, while the modified code fragment checks if `ended` is false and `end` is true. This could potentially cause the test to pass when it should fail, or vice versa.
