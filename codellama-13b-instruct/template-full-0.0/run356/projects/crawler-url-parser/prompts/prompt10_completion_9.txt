  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace the `http` protocol with `https`, which could cause the URL to be parsed differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace the `http` protocol with `http`, which could cause the URL to be parsed differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove the `http` protocol, which could cause the URL to be parsed differently.

DONE.
