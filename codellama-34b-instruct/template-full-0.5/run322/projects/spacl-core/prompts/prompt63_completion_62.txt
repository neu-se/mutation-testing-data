  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire part string to the props array instead of just the part after the colon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not replace any special characters in the part string before pushing it to the parts array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/:/g, '')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all colons from the part string before pushing it to the parts array, instead of just removing the colon after the first character.

DONE.
