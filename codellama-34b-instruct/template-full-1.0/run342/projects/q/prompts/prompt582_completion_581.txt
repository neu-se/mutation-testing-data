  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuation)
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuation` would be bound to the `continuation` function, which is not what was intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.sync(arg).throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.sync` would be called on `arg`, instead of `arg` being passed as an argument to the `throw` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.sync(throw).args
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.sync` would be called on the `throw` function, instead of `throw` being called with `continuation` as its `this` value.

DONE.
