  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `embedType` is falsy or if it is not equal to the first key of `b`, while the new code fragment only checks if `embedType` is not equal to the first key of `b`. If `embedType` is falsy, the original code fragment would return `true`, while the new code fragment would return `false`.
