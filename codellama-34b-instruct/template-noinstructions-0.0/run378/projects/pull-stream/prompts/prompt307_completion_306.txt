  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `cb` if `ended` was true, but this new code fragment calls `cb` regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called `cb` with the `data` argument, but this new code fragment calls `cb` with `null` as the `data` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `cb` with `ended` as the first argument if `ended` was true, but this new code fragment calls `cb` with `ended` as the first argument regardless of the value of `ended`.

DONE.
