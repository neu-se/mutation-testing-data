  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || function (err) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the `read` function's callback. The original code fragment passes the `done` callback as the second argument to `read`, which means that the `read` function will call the `done` callback with the result of the read operation. In contrast, the new code fragment passes a new function as the second argument to `read`, which means that the `read` function will call this new function with the result of the read operation instead of the `done` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && function (err) {}
