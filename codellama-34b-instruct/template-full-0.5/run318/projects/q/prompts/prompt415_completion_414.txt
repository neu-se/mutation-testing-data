  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if an object is a promise-like object, meaning it has a `then` method, but it does not necessarily have to be a `Promise` instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise` would return `true` for any object that is not a promise, including promise-like objects, while `isPromise` would return `false` for such objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` would return `true` for any fulfilled promise, while `isPromise` would return `true` for any promise, regardless of its state.

DONE.
