  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is a regular expression object, and calling `test()` on it would always return `true`, causing the function to return the first rule's replacement string instead of the correct one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an extra 's' to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
's' + rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an extra 's' to the beginning of the word, regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

DONE.
