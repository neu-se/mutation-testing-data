  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to `undefined` instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to an empty object instead of the expected object.

DONE.
