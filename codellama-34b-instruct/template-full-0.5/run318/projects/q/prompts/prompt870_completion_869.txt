  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).npost
```
This would result in different behavior because `npost` is a method that calls a method of a Node-style object that accepts a Node-style callback, while `nfapply` is a method that passes a continuation to a Node function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `nbind` is a method that wraps a NodeJS continuation passing function and returns an equivalent version that returns a promise, while `nfapply` is a method that passes a continuation to a Node function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).denodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because `denodeify` is a method that wraps a NodeJS continuation passing function and returns an equivalent version that returns a promise, while `nfapply` is a method that passes a continuation to a Node function.

DONE.
