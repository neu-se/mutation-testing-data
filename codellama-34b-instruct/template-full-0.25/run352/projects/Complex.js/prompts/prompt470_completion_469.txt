  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that `b` must be not only non-zero, but also not equal to `1`. In the original code, the `!==` operator is used to check if `b` is not equal to `1`, but this does not guarantee that `b` is non-zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that `b` must be not only non-zero, but also not equal to `0`. In the original code, the `!==` operator is used to check if `b` is not equal to `1`, but this does not guarantee that `b` is non-zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different
