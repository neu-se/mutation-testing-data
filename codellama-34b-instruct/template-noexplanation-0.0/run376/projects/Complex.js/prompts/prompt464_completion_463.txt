  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This change will cause the `toVector` method to return the floor of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, rather than the absolute value. This could potentially cause issues in code that relies on the `toVector` method to return the correct values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This change will cause the `toVector` method to return the ceiling of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, rather than the absolute value. This could potentially cause issues in code that relies on the `toVector` method to return the correct values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This change will cause the `toVector` method to return the rounded value of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, rather than the absolute value. This could potentially cause issues in code that relies on the `toVector` method to return the correct values.

DONE.
