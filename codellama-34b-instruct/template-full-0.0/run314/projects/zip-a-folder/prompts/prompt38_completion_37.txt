  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the `src` variable is not a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is called with the `src` variable as an argument, which would cause the function to return `true` if the `src` variable is a glob, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the `src` variable contains the `*` character, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if the `src` variable is a glob, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
