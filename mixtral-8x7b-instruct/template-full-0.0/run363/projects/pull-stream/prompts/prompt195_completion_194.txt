 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Artificial error for mutation testing')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error passed to the callback would be different, allowing us to check if the error handling in the tests is able to distinguish between different types of errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` value would be replaced with a boolean true, which might not be treated the same way in the tests, allowing us to check if the tests are robust against different types of `aborted` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` value would be replaced with a null, which might not be treated the same way in the tests, allowing us to check if the tests are robust against different types of `aborted` values.

DONE.
