  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by 2 steps instead of 1, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iterator backward by 1 step instead of forward, potentially causing the algorithm to miss important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not advance the iterator at all, causing the algorithm to loop indefinitely.

DONE.
