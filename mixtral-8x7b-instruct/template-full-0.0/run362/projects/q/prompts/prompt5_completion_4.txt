 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"promisf", definition
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promisf` is not a valid type, causing a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"promise", function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a new anonymous function is passed instead of the `definition` function, which would cause the code to fail when the function is expected to have specific properties and methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"promise", true
```
This would result in different behavior because a boolean value is passed instead of the `definition` function, causing the code to fail when the function is expected to have specific properties and methods.

DONE.
