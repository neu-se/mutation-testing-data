  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the root path, regardless of the actual path of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/" + linkurl_parts[linkurl_parts.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last part of the URL path, rather than the entire path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last part of the URL path, rather than returning the entire path.

DONE.
