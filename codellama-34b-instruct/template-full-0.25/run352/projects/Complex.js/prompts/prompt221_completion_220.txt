  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a complex number, while the new code fragment uses the `-b` variable, which is a different complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a complex number, while the new code fragment uses the `b + 1` variable, which is a different complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a complex number, while the new code fragment uses the `b * 2` variable, which is a different complex number.

DONE.
