  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of strings, rather than an array of lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of lines, rather than an array of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split(":")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of strings, each containing a single line and column number.

DONE.
