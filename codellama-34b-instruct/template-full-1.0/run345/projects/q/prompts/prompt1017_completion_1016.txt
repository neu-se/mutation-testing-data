  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", nodeArgs).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` parameter is missing, which could cause the method to dispatch to the wrong function or value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs.slice()]).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the method to dispatch with different arguments than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("get", [name, nodeArgs]).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is used instead of `post`, which could cause the method to retrieve different data or cause an error if the `get` method is not defined.

DONE.
