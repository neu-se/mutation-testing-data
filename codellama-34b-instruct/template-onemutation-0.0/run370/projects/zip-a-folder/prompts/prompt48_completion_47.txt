  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `finalize` method to throw an error, which would be caught by the `output.on('error', reject)` handler and result in the promise being rejected.

DONE.
