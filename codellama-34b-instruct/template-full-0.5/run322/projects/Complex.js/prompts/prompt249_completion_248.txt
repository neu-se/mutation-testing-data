  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `a`, which could change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `a`, which could also change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `a`, which could significantly change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
