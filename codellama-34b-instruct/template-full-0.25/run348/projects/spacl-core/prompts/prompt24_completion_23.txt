  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(max > 0) && any`, which would always be `false` if `max` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 || !any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `any`, so the expression would be evaluated as `max > 0 || !any`, which would always be `true` if `max` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && !any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(max > 0) && !any`, which would always be `false` if `max` is greater
