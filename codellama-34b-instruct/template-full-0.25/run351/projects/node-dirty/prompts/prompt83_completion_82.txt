  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because `chunk.indexOf('\n')` would return the index of the first occurrence of `\n` in the chunk, whereas `chunk.lastIndexOf('\n')` would return the index of the last occurrence of `\n` in the chunk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.split('\n').length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `chunk.split('\n').length - 1` would return the number of lines in the chunk, whereas `chunk.lastIndexOf('\n')` would return the index of the last occurrence of `\n` in the chunk.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.match(/\n/g).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `chunk.match(/\n/g).length` would return the number of occurrences of `\n` in the chunk, whereas `chunk.lastIndexOf('\n')` would
