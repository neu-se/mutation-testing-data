  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is a function that returns a promise, while `fs.writeFileSync` is a function that returns nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a function that returns nothing, while `fs.writeFile` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a function that returns nothing, while `fs.writeFile` is a function that returns a promise. Additionally, the `options` argument is not passed to `fs.writeFileSync`, which may result in different behavior if the options are used in the implementation of `fs.writeFileSync`.

DONE.
