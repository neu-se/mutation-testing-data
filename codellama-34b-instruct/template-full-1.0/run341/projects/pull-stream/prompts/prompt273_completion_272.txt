  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' !== typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `stream` argument is a function, while this change checks if it is a string. If a stream is passed in, it will be treated as a function instead of a stream, leading to errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `stream` argument is a function, while this change checks if it is `null`. If a `null` value is passed in, it will be treated as a function instead of a `null` value, leading to errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof stream !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `stream` argument is a function, while this change checks if it is `undefined`. If an `undefined` value is passed in, it will be treated as a function instead of an `undefined
