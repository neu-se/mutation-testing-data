  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, so the promise chain would be broken and any subsequent `.then()` or `.catch()` calls would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, so the promise chain would be broken and any subsequent `.then()` or `.catch()` calls would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected immediately, so any subsequent `.then()` or `.catch()` calls would not be executed.

DONE.
