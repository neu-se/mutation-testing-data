  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream.end()` will close the write stream immediately, instead of waiting for the current write to finish.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream.destroy()` will close the write stream immediately, instead of waiting for the current write to finish.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.pipe(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream.pipe(this)` will cause the write stream to pipe its output to the current object, instead of waiting for the current write to finish.

DONE.
