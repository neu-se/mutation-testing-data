  Sure, here are my three options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.replace(/\n/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.substring` returns the substring of the stack trace that starts at the given index, whereas `e.stack.replace(/\n/g, '')` replaces all newline characters with an empty string, which could potentially cause the stack trace to become unreadable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.charAt(e.stack.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.charAt(e.stack.length - 1)` returns the last character of the stack trace, whereas `e.stack.substring` could potentially return the middle or end of the stack trace, depending on the value of the index argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf('[object Promise]')
```
This would result in different
