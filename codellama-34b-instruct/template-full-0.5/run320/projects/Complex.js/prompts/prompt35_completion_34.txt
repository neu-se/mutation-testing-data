  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Math.log(_a)` when `a === b`, instead of `Math.log(_a)` when `a < b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Math.log(_a)` when `a > b`, instead of `Math.log(_a)` when `a < b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Math.log(_a)` when `a !== b`, instead of `Math.log(_a)` when `a < b`.

DONE.
