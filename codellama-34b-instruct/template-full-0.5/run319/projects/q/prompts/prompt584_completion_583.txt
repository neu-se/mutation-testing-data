  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, but the replaced code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("This is a bug"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not return a rejected promise, but the replaced code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(new Error("This is a bug"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not return a resolved promise, but the replaced code fragment does.

DONE.
