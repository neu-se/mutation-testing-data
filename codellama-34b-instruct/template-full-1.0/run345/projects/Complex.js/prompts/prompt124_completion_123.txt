  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] ? Complex['INFINITY'] : new Complex(a / c, b / d);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['INFINITY']` when `z` is infinite, rather than when `a` or `b` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0 ? Complex['INFINITY'] : new Complex(a / c, b / d);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['INFINITY']` when `a` is not zero, rather than when `a` or `b` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c != 0 ? Complex['INFINITY'] : new Complex(a / c, b / d);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['INFINITY']` when `c` is not zero, rather than when `a
