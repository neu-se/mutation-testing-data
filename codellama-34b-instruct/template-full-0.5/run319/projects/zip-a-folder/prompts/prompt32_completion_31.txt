  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the output stream is closed, while the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs during the compression process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` event is emitted when the compression process is complete, while the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs during the compression process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the compression process is complete, while the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs during the compression process.

DONE.
