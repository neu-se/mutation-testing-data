  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a way to explicitly return `undefined` in JavaScript, while `null` is a distinct value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a way to explicitly return `undefined` in JavaScript, while `true` is a distinct value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a way to explicitly return `undefined` in JavaScript, while `0` is a distinct value.

DONE.
