  Here are three options for mutating the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is a function with one argument, but this new code fragment checks if `a` is a function with more than one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is a function, but this new code fragment checks if `a` is an object with a `length` property that is equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is a function with one argument, but this new code fragment checks if `a` is a function with more than one argument (or a non-function).
