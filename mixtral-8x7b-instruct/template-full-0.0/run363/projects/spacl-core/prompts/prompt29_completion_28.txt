 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.join('').match
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the `reduce` function to a `match` function, which would return an array of matches instead of reducing the array to a single value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the `parts` array, which could lead to incorrect regular expression generation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.filter(x => x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any falsy values from the `parts` array, which could lead to incorrect regular expression generation.

DONE.
