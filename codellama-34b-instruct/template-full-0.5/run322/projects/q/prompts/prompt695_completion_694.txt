  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` would create a promise that is already fulfilled with the value `null`, whereas `Q(object)` would create a promise that is pending until the object is resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` would create a promise that is already fulfilled with the value `undefined`, whereas `Q(object)` would create a promise that is pending until the object is resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q("foo")` would create a promise that is already fulfilled with the value `"foo"`, whereas `Q(object)` would create a promise that is pending until the object is resolved or rejected.

DONE.
