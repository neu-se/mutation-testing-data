  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a runtime error when the node-style callback is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('intentional error') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would always throw an error, regardless of the input, causing the promise chain to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would always return `0`, regardless of the input, whereas the original code fragment would return the original value or `undefined` if the input was `undefined`.

DONE.
