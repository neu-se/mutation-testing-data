  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    delta.push(this.ops[this.ops.length - 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the last operation from this.ops onto delta, rather than the next operation from the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    delta.push(other.ops[other.ops.length - 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the last operation from other.ops onto delta, rather than the next operation from the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    delta.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a new operation, newOp, onto delta, rather than the next operation from the iterator.

DONE.
