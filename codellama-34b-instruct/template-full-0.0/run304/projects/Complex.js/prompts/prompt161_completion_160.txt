  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['NAN'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `this` and `z` being infinite, while this new code fragment only checks for `this` being infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['INFINITY'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `this` and `z` being infinite, while this new code fragment checks for either `this` or `z` being infinite.
