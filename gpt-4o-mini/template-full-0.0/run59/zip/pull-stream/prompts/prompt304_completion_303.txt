Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with `null` for both the error and data parameters, effectively ignoring the actual data read and potentially causing downstream logic to fail or behave incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of `ended` as the first argument to the callback instead of `null`, which could lead to incorrect handling of the end state in the consuming code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always indicate an error (by passing `true` as the first argument) regardless of whether the read operation was successful, which could mislead the caller into thinking there was an error when there wasn't.

DONE.
