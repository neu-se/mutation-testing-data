 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would immediately execute the `fulfilled` callback with `undefined` instead of waiting for the generator to request the next value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback(generator)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would execute the `fulfilled` callback with the generator object itself instead of the first value produced by the generator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would immediately execute the `fulfilled` callback with a hard-coded value of 42, bypassing the generator entirely.

DONE.
