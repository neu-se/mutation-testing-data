  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {
    throw new Error("I'm a buggy function!");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error instead of returning a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {
    return "I'm a buggy function!";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a string instead of a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {
    return function () {
        throw new Error("I'm a buggy function!");
    };
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a function that throws an error instead of a function that returns a value.

DONE.
