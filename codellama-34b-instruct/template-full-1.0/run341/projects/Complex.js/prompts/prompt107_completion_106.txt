  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit("unexpected error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a specific error message, "parser_exit(<PLACEHOLDER>);", but the new code exits with a different error message, "parser_exit("unexpected error");".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a specific error message, "parser_exit(<PLACEHOLDER>);", but the new code exits without an error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex("unexpected error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number, but the new code returns a string.

DONE.
