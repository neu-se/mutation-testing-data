  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will reject the promise with the given value, whereas `Q(value)` will resolve the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` will resolve the promise with the given value, whereas `Q(value)` will resolve the promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value).then(function() {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it will resolve the promise with the given value, but then throw an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
