  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different function than "apply", and would likely cause the code to function differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" is a different function than "apply", and would likely cause the code to function differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"map"
```
This would result in different behavior because "map" is a different function than "apply", and would likely cause the code to function differently.

DONE.
