Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the sine of φ2 instead of the angle φ2 itself, leading to an incorrect latitude calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + δ
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the angular distance δ to the initial latitude φ1 instead of calculating the new latitude based on the sine of φ2, resulting in an incorrect destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the original latitude φ1 instead of the calculated φ2, meaning the destination point would not change based on the distance and bearing provided.

DONE.
