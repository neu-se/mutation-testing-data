  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === value
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` and `value` are not necessarily the same object, even if they have the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.valueOf() === value.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf()` is not always the same as the object itself, and it may return different values for different objects that have the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.toString() === value.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` is not always the same as the object itself, and it may return different values for different objects that have the same value.

DONE.
