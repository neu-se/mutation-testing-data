  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is different, and would match a different set of words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-z]/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is different, and would match a different set of words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-zA-Z]/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is different, and would match a different set of words.

DONE.
