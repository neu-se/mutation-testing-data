  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof point !== 'object' && point !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `point` is an object or null, while this new code checks if `point` is not an object and not null. This would cause the code to behave differently when `point` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject(point) || point === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `point` is an object or null, while this new code checks if `point` is an object or null and returns the reverse of the original result. This would cause the code to behave differently when `point` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof point === 'object' && point !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `point` is an object or null, while this new code checks if `point` is an object and not null. This
