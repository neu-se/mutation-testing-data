Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset / 120
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code divides the offset by 60 to get the hours, but this replacement divides it by 120, effectively halving the hours value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the hours from the offset, but this replacement calculates it from the minutes, which is a different value altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil(offset) / 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses Math.floor to round down the hours, but this replacement uses Math.ceil to round up, which can result in a different hours value for certain offsets.

DONE.
