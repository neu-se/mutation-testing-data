  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains the attributes of the next operation, whereas `push` adds a new operation to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the next operation, whereas `push` adds a new operation to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that concatenates the next operation with the current delta, whereas `push` adds a new operation to the delta.

DONE.
