  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a node resolver, but `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a property that refers to the node resolver itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)` is a function call that returns a node resolver with a null context, but `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a property that refers to the node resolver itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)` is a function call that returns a node resolver with an undefined context, but `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a property that refers to the node resolver itself.

DONE.
