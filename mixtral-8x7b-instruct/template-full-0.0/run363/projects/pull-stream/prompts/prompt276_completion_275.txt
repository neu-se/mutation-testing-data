 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to move on to the next stream even when there is still data in the current stream. This could lead to data loss or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_read` function to be overwritten with an empty function, which would prevent the function from ever calling `nextChunk` or `nextStream` again. This would cause the function to get stuck and never produce any output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_read` function to be overwritten with the `read` function, which is passed as an argument to the outer function. This would cause the function to call itself recursively, which could lead to a stack overflow or other unexpected behavior.

DONE.
