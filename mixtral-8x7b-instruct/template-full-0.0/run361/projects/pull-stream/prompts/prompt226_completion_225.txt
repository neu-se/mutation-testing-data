 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => !data % test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the modulo operator instead of a logical NOT operator, which would always return false and not negate the result of the test function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => !test(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the data before passing it to the test function, which would cause the test to fail if the test function expects a certain format or value of data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => test.apply(null, [data])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the apply method instead of passing the data as an argument, which could cause issues if the test function relies on the 'this' keyword or if it expects multiple arguments.

DONE.
