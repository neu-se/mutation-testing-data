  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator used in the original code fragment is `/`, which performs integer division and returns the integer part of the result. Using `*` instead would result in a different value, which could produce different behavior in the `getOffsetStr` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60 + offset / 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator used in the original code fragment is `/`, which performs integer division and returns the integer part of the result. Using `%` instead would result in a different value, which could produce different behavior in the `getOffsetStr` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 60 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator used in the original code fragment is `/`, which performs integer division and returns the integer part of the result. Adding 1 to the result would produce different behavior in the `getOffset
