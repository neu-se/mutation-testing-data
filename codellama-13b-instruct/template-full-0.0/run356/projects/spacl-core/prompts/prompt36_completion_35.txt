  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reversed array of strings, while the modified code fragment returns a reversed array of arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).map(x => x.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reversed array of strings, while the modified code fragment returns a reversed array of strings with all characters converted to uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).filter(x => x.length > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reversed array of strings, while the modified code fragment returns a reversed array of strings with all empty strings removed.

DONE.
