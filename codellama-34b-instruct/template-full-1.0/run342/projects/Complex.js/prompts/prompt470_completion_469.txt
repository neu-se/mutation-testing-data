  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the condition is checking whether `b` is not equal to `1`, but in the mutated code, it is checking whether `1` is not equal to `b`. This change would result in different behavior if `b` is not equal to `1`, as the rest of the code would be executed differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the condition is checking whether `b` is not equal to `1`, but in the mutated code, it is checking whether `b` is less than `1`. This change would result in different behavior if `b` is greater than or equal to `1`, as the rest of the code would be executed differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 < b
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the condition is checking
