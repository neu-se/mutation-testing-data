  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the `replace` method would not match the same characters as the original code fragment, which could cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error or produce an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/^\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the `replace` method would not match the same characters as the original code fragment, which could cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error or produce an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/\/\//, '')

This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the `replace` method would not match the same characters as the original code fragment, which could cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error or produce
