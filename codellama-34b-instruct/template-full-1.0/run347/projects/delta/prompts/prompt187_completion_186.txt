  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler.insert('hello', null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `retain` function, which returns the `insert` function with the `attributes` argument set to `null`. However, the `insert` function does not have an `attributes` argument, so it will result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler.insert('hello', 'world')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `retain` function, which returns the `insert` function with the `attributes` argument set to `null`. However, this code would insert the string `world` instead of `null`, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler.insert('hello', Delta.getHandler.insert('hello', null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `retain` function
