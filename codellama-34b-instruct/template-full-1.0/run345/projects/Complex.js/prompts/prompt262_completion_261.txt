  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the value of the second operand. Replace this with `a + b`, which is a simple binary addition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ^ b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the value of the second operand. Replace this with `a ^ b`, which is a binary xor operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the value of the second operand. Replace this with `a * b`, which is a binary multiplication.

DONE.
