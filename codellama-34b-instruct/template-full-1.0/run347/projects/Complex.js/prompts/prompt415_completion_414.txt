  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a * a);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of exponentiation, whereas the original code returns the result of square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(1 - a * a);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of subtraction, whereas the original code returns the result of addition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a % 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of modulo operation, whereas the original code returns the result of addition.

DONE.
