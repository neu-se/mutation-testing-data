Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0 && this._inFlightWrites === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to only allow closing when both the queue is empty and there are no in-flight writes, which could lead to premature closure of the write stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the condition to only check if there is more than one item in the queue, potentially allowing the close operation to proceed even when there are pending writes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if there are items in the queue and if the number of in-flight writes is negative, which is logically impossible and could lead to unexpected behavior in the flushing process.

DONE.
