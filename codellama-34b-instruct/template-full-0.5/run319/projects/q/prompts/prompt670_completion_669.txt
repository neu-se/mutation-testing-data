  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 1, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to `dispatch` would be `1` instead of `undefined`, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `dispatch` would be a shallow copy of `args` instead of the original `args` array, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.concat()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `dispatch` would be a concatenation of `args` and an empty array, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
