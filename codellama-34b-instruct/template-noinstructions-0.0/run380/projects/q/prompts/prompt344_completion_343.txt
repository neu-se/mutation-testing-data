  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, and therefore the `then` method would not be called on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, and therefore the `then` method would not be called on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, and therefore the `then` method would be called with the rejection reason.

DONE.
