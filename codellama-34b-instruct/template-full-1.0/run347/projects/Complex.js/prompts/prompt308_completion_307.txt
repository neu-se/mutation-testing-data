  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the calculation of the square root in the `cosh` function, which would produce a different output for the `csc` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the calculation of the square root in the `sinh` function, which would produce a different output for the `csc` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the calculation of the square root in the `cosh` function, which would produce a different output for the `sec` function.

DONE.
