  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return the entire string instead of the substring starting from the 8th character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return the substring starting from the 8th character to the end of the string, instead of the substring starting from the 8th character to the end of the string and then removing the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return the substring starting from the 8th character to the end of the string, instead of the substring starting from the 8th character and then removing the last character.

DONE.
