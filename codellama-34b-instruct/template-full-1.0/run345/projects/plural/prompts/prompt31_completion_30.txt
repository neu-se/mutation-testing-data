  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) {
  w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate the substring with the plural suffix, while this code fragment uses the `+=` operator, which would modify the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) {
  w.slice(-2, -1) + 'es';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr` to extract the substring, while this code fragment uses `slice` with negative indices to extract the substring, and then concatenates the substring with the plural suffix using the `+` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) {
  w.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr`
