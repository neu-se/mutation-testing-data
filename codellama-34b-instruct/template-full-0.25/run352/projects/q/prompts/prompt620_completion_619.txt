  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `dispatch` method to send a message to the object, while this replacement uses the `set` method to set a property on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `dispatch` method to send a message to the object, while this replacement uses the `get` method to retrieve a property from the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `dispatch` method to send a message to the object, while this replacement uses the `delete` method to delete a property from the object.

DONE.
