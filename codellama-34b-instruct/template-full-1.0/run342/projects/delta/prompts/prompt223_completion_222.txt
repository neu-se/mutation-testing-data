  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first string instead of the second, causing the comparison to be between the same string, resulting in no differences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings.reverse()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the array of strings, causing the comparison to be between different strings, potentially resulting in differences where there were none before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * strings.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select a string from the array, potentially causing the comparison to be between different strings, potentially resulting in differences where there were none before.

DONE.
