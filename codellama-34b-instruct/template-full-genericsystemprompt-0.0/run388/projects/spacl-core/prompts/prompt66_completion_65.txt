  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would not execute, as `null` is not iterable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, as `this.rules[0]` is a single element and not an iterable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules.slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the second element of `this.rules`, skipping the first element.

DONE.
