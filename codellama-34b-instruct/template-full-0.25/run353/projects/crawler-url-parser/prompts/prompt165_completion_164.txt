  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the `pageurl_path` string, which could potentially change the result of the `includes()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the `pageurl_path` string, which could potentially change the result of the `includes()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the last segment of the `pageurl_path` string, which could potentially change the result of the `includes()` method.

DONE.
