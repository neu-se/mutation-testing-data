  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `object` variable, which may have a value other than `null`. If `object` is `null`, the `Q.delay` method will return a promise that is resolved with `null`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `object` variable, which may have a value other than `undefined`. If `object` is `undefined`, the `Q.delay` method will return a promise that is resolved with `undefined`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `object` variable, which may have a value other than `0`. If `object` is `0`, the `Q.delay` method will return a promise that is resolved with `
