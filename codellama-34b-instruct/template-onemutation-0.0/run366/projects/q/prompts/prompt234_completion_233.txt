  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, and `resolvedPromise.promise` is a property of that object that refers to the promise itself. By using `resolvedPromise.promise`, the code would be referring to the promise object, rather than the promise's value. This would likely cause the code to behave differently, as the promise object and its value are not necessarily the same thing.
