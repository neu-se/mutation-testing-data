  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the pluralization rule to words that end with "ix", while the new code fragment applies it to words that end with "ix" or "ex".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the pluralization rule to words that end with "ix", while the new code fragment applies it to words that end with "ix" or "ex".
