  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a` and adds 1, while the mutated code fragment calculates the square of `a` and subtracts 1. This change in behavior would cause the `acsch` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect results in the calculation of the complex inverse.

DONE.
