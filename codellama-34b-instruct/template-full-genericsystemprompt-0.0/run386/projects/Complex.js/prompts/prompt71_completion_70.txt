  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\d+\.?\d*e[+-]?\d+|\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+|./g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not correctly escaped, which could cause the code to produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\d+\.?\d*e[+-]?\d+|\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+|./g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not correctly escaped, which could cause the code to produce unexpected results.
