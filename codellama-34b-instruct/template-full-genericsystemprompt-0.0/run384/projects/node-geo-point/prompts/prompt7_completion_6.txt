  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || !Array.isArray(point.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow objects with a `type` property that is not `'Point'` and arrays with a `coordinates` property that is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') || point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow objects with a `type` property that is not `'Point'` and arrays with a `coordinates` property that is not an array.
