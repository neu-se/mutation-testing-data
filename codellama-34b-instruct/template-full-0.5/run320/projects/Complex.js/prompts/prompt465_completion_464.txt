  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the result of the comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the result of the comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the result of the comparison.

DONE.
