  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the variable `a` instead of `b`, which may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the variable `c` instead of `b`, which may have a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the property `b` of the current object instead of the variable `b`, which may have a different value.

DONE.
