  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator changes the sign of the value, which would affect the calculation of the tangent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator adds 1 to the value, which would affect the calculation of the tangent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator multiplies the value by 2, which would affect the calculation of the tangent.

DONE.
