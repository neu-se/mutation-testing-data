  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the length of the `attributes` object is greater than 0, while this new code checks if it's greater than 1. This means that if there is only one attribute in the `attributes` object, the original code would return `undefined`, while this new code would return the `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the length of the `attributes` object is greater than 0, while this new code checks if it's equal to 0. This means that if there are any attributes in the `attributes` object, the original code would return the `attributes` object, while this new code would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length % 2 === 0
