  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options ? options.reviver : null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to parse the data as JSON, but the `options` object is not passed to `JSON.parse()`, which may cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options ? options.reviver : undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to parse the data as JSON, but the `reviver` function is not passed to `JSON.parse()`, which may cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options ? options.reviver : {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to parse the data as JSON, but the `reviver` function is not passed to `JSON.parse()`, which may cause an error.

DONE.
