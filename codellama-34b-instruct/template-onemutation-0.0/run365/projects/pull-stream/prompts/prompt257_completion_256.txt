  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `err` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `err` is `false`, and `false` when `err` is `true`. This would cause the `read` function to be called with `true` as the first argument, which would result in an infinite loop.

DONE.
