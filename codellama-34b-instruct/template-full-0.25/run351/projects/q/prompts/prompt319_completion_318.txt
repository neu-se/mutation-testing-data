  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the code to access the wrong property in the `descriptor` object, potentially leading to a `TypeError` or other unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `descriptor[op]` property would be overwritten with a new function, potentially changing the behavior of the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `descriptor[op]` property would be set to `null`, potentially causing errors in the code that uses it.

DONE.
