  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherData` object is now being accessed with the `length` property, which is not present in the original code. This could cause the code to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherData` object is now being accessed with the `length` property minus one, which is not present in the original code. This could cause the code to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherData` object is now being accessed with the `length` property plus one, which is not present in the original code. This could cause the code to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
