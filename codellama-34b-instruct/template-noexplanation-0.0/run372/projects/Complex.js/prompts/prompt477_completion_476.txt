  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This change will cause the `isFinite` method to always return `false`, as `this['im']` is always a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This change will cause the `isFinite` method to always return `true`, as the sum of `this['re']` and `this['im']` is always a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This change will cause the `isFinite` method to always return `false`, as the product of `this['re']` and `this['im']` is always a finite number.

DONE.
