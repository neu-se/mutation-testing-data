  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
```
This change will cause the `push` method to always set the `attributes` property of the new op to `null`, regardless of whether it was originally set to a non-null value. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the `attributes` property being set to a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = {};
```
This change will cause the `push` method to always set the `attributes` property of the new op to an empty object, regardless of whether it was originally set to a non-empty object. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the `attributes` property being set to a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = undefined;
```
This change will cause the `push` method to always set the `attributes` property of the new op to `undefined`, regardless of whether it was originally set to a defined value.
