  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, which would cause the `nmapply` method to pass the wrong arguments to the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new array containing all elements of `args` twice, which would cause the `nmapply` method to pass the wrong arguments to the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method would return a new array containing all elements of `args` in reverse order, which would cause the `nmapply` method to pass the wrong arguments to the `post` method.

DONE.
