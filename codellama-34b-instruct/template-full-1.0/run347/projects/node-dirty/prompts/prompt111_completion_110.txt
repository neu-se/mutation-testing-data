  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Assuming corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the message of the error without changing the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the beginning of the db: ${buffer}`);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would report a corruption error at the beginning of the database rather than at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (buffer !== '') {
  this.emit('error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error only if the buffer is not empty, which could cause the program to behave differently in certain edge cases.

DONE.
