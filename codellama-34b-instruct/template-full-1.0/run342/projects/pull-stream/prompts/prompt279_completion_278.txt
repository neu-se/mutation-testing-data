  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the second element of the `prop` array instead of the first one, which is the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `foo` property of the `prop` object instead of the `prop` function itself, which is the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return data + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different result for the same input, instead of the original `prop` function which returns the same input unchanged.

DONE.
