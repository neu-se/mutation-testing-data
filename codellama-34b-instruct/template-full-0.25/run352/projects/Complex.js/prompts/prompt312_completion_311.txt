  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is replaced with `a + 1`, which would change the result of the `Math.sin` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is replaced with `b - 1`, which would change the result of the `Math.cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is replaced with `a * b`, which would change the result of the `Math.tan` function.

DONE.
