  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(null, 2)` would return an empty array, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return an array containing the second and subsequent arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(0, 2)` would return an empty array, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return an array containing the second and subsequent arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(undefined, 2)` would return an empty array, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return an array containing the second and subsequent arguments.

DONE.
