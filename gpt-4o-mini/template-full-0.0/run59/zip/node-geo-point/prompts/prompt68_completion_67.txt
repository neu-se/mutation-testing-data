Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the bearing by using the `y` variable instead of `x`, which will lead to incorrect results in the bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `x` with `0` will cause the `atan2` function to always return a constant angle, leading to incorrect bearing calculations regardless of the input points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because using `1` instead of `x` will alter the calculation in a way that does not reflect the actual relationship between the two points, resulting in an incorrect bearing value.

DONE.
