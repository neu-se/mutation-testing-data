  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__maximumStackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackCounter` property is used to determine the minimum stack depth, and changing it to `__maximumStackCounter__` would cause the function to use the maximum stack depth instead, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackCounter` property is used to determine the minimum stack depth, and changing it to `__stackCounter__` would cause the function to use the current stack depth instead, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackDepth__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackCounter` property is used to determine the minimum stack depth, and changing it to `__stackDepth__` would cause the function to use the current stack depth instead, which could result in different behavior.

DONE.
