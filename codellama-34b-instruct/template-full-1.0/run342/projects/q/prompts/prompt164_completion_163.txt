  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the end of the array instead of the beginning, potentially looping in the wrong direction or accessing an index that doesn't exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at an undefined index, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
