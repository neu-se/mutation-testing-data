  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would consider the second component of the `diffResult` array, which contains the number of inserted characters, instead of the first component, which contains the number of deleted characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[0] + component[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would consider the sum of the first and second components of the `diffResult` array, which contains the number of inserted and deleted characters, instead of the first component, which contains the number of deleted characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would consider the third component of the `diffResult` array, which contains the number of equal characters, instead of the first component, which contains the number of deleted characters.

DONE.
