  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w == 'dwarf' || w == 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the strict equality operator `===` which checks for both value and type equality, while the new code uses the abstract equality operator `==` which only checks for value equality. This means that the new code would return `true` for any value that is loosely equal to `'dwarf'` or `'roof'`, even if it is not of the same type.

DONE.
