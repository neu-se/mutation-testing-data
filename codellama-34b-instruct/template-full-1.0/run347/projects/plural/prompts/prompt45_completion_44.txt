  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substring(0, w.length - 1) + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not handle words that end in "oy" correctly, such as "boy", "toy", and "soy". Instead, it would return the original word without the "y" and add "s", resulting in "boys", "toys", and "soys".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substring(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not handle words that end in "oy" correctly, such as "boy", "toy", and "soy". Instead, it would return the original word without the "y" and add "es", resulting in "boyes", "toyes",
