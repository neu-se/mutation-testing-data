  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a different object than `resolvedPromise`, and it does not have a `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array of arguments passed to the `promiseDispatch` method, and it does not have a `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object and does not have a `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
