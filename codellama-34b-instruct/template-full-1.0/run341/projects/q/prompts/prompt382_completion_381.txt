  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.fcall is a function that takes a function as its argument and returns a promise that resolves with the return value of the function, whereas Q is an instance of the Q promise library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because Promise.resolve is a method that takes a value as an argument and returns a promise that resolves with that value, whereas Q is an instance of the Q promise library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.seq
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.seq is a function that takes an array of promise-returning functions as its argument and returns a promise that resolves with the return value of the last function in the array, whereas Q is an instance of the Q promise library.

DONE.
