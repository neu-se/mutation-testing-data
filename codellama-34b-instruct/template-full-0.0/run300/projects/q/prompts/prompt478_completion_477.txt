  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would not remove any elements from the array, as the starting index is 0, and the number of elements to remove is 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the last element from the array, as the starting index is -1, and the number of elements to remove is 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the first two elements from the array, as the starting index is 2, and the number of elements to remove is 1.

DONE.
