  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp()` is a function that calculates the exponential of a number, whereas `Math.pow()` is a function that calculates the power of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is a multiplication operation, whereas `Math.pow()` is a function that calculates the power of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is an addition operation, whereas `Math.pow()` is a function that calculates the power of a number.

DONE.
