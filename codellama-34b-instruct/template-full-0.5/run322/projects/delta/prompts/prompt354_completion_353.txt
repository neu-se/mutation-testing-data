  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is not declared in the original code, and its absence would likely cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is not declared in the original code, and its absence would likely cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is not declared in the original code, and its absence would likely cause a syntax error.

DONE.
