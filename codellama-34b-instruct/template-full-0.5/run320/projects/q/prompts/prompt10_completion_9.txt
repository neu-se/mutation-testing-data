  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and its absence would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, and its use in the provided code snippet would cause the `head` variable to be assigned the value `undefined`, rather than the expected function reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a JavaScript value that represents the absence of any object value, and its use in the provided code snippet would cause the `head` variable to be assigned the value `null`, rather than the expected function reference.

DONE.
