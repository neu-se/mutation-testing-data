  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// 'src' replaced with 'undefined'
if (!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && undefined) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a string, and therefore the code will throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// 'src' replaced with 'null'
if (!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and therefore the code will treat it as a truthy value, causing the `if` statement to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// 'src' replaced with '['42']'
if (!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && ['42']) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `['42']` is an array with a single element `'42'`, and therefore the code will treat it as a truthy value, causing
