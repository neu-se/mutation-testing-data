 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(fulfilled)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function would receive a promise instead of a direct value, which might not raise exceptions as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function might not call the `onUnhandledError` callback as intended when a rejection occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
