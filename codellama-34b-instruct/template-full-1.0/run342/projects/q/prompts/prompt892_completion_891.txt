  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.denodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.denodeify` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when invoked, whereas `Q` is a function and would not cause such an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a value that can be coerced into a function call, whereas `Q` is a function that can be invoked with relevant arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is called with different arguments than the original `Q.denodeify`, which could affect the outcome of the test.

DONE.
