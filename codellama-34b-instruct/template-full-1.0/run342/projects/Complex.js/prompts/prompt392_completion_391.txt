  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would calculate the hypotenuse of the real part of the complex number, rather than the magnitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the magnitude of the complex number, rather than the square root of the square of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would calculate the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, rather than the magnitude.

DONE.
