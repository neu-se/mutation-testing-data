  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit()` function would not be called, resulting in any rejections not being tracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit()` function would be called with the string "error" instead of the reason for the rejection, which could cause issues if the consumer of the library is expecting a specific format for the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit()` function would be called with the result of `Q.fulfill("error")` instead of the reason for the rejection, which could cause issues if the consumer of the library is expecting a specific format for the rejection reason.

DONE.
