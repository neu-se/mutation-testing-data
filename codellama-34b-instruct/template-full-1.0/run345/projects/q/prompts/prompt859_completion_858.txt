  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function, and `null` is not a function, so the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and the code would throw an error when it tries to call `deferred.reject` as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => {}` is a function, but it doesn't do anything, so the code would not reject the promise as it's supposed to.

DONE.
