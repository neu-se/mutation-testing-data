  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, other.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the attributes of the current operation with the attributes of the other delta, rather than the attributes of the current operation with the attributes of the base operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the attributes of the current operation with the attributes of the base operation, rather than the attributes of the current operation with the attributes of the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, other.ops[0].attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the attributes of the current operation with the attributes of the first operation in the other delta, rather than the attributes of the current operation with the attributes of the base operation.

DONE.
