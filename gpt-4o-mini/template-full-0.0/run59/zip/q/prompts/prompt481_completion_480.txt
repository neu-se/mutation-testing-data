Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the next index in the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the correct index, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect data being removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the first element of the `unhandledReasons` array, regardless of which promise was untracked, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to remove the element at the previous index, which may not correspond to the intended promise's reason, thus corrupting the state of the `unhandledReasons` array.

DONE.
