  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `b` is equal to zero, rather than checking if both `a` and `b` are equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `z['re']` is greater than zero, rather than checking if `a` is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `this['im']` is greater than zero, rather than checking if `b` is equal to zero.

DONE.
