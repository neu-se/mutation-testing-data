  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the key to be incremented by 1, which would result in a different key being used for the `get` and `set` operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would cause the key to be converted to uppercase, which would result in a different key being used for the `get` and `set` operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods would cause the key to be reversed, which would result in a different key being used for the `get` and `set` operations.

DONE.
