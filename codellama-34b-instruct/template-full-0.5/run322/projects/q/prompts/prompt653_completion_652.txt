  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments passed to the `post` method would be offset by one, potentially causing the method to access the wrong data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments passed to the `post` method would be truncated to only include the first two arguments, potentially causing the method to miss important data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments passed to the `post` method would be truncated to only include the first argument, potentially causing the method to miss important data.

DONE.
