  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary plus operator is used instead of the unary minus operator, which would cause the result to be incorrect in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '*' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is used instead of the addition operator, which would cause the result to be incorrect in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '/' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the division operator is used instead of the addition operator, which would cause the result to be incorrect in certain cases.

DONE.
