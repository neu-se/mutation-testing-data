  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to produce a different output, as `Math.max` returns the largest value in a list of numbers, rather than the smallest value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a, b) => a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to produce a different output, as the function returns the sum of its two arguments, rather than the minimum of the two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a, b) => a > b ? a : b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to produce a different output, as the function returns the larger of its two arguments, rather than the smaller argument.

DONE.
