  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes two arguments, but `cb` is only being passed as a single argument. This would cause the function to behave differently and potentially result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is being passed as the first argument to `abortCb`, which is not the same as passing `abort` as the first argument. This would cause the function to behave differently and potentially result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(abort, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is being passed as the second argument to `abortCb`, which is not the same as passing `onAbort` as the second argument. This would cause the function to behave differently and potentially result
