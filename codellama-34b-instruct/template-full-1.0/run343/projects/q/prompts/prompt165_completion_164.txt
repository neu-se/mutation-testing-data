  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an extra iteration of the loop, potentially accessing an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to never run, as the loop's condition is initially false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to run once, but the body of the loop would not be executed, as the loop's condition is initially false.

DONE.
