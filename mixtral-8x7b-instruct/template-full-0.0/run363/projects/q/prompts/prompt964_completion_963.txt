 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the global object, which is not guaranteed to be the same as `this` in the context of the method call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a numeric literal, which would behave differently when used in method or property access operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a special value that represents the absence of any object, and would not have the same methods or properties as `this`.

DONE.
