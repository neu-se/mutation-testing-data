  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `ended` to `true` if `end` is truthy, while this replacement sets `ended` to `true` if `end` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `ended` to `true` if `end` is truthy, while this replacement sets `ended` to `true` if `end` is truthy and `true` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `ended` to `true` if `end` is truthy, while this replacement sets `ended` to `true` if `end` is truthy or `false` is truthy.

DONE.
