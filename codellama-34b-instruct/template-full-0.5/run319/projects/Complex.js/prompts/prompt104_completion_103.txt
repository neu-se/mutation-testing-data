  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with a non-zero exit code, indicating an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit('error');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with a string argument, indicating an error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid input');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an exception to be thrown, which would be caught by the `try...catch` block and handled accordingly.

DONE.
