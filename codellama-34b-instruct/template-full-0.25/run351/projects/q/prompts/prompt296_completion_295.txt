  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(y)` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `y`, whereas `Q(x).join` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `x` joined with the value of `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(function(value) { return value + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(x).then(function(value) { return value + 1; })` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `x` plus 1, whereas `Q(x).join` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `x` joined with the value of `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(function(value) { return value * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(x).then(function
