  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^\n/g` matches the start of a line, while the original code fragment `/\n/g` matches any newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^\uFEFF/g` matches the start of a line, while the original code fragment `/\n/g` matches any newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^\uFEFF/g` matches the start of a line, while the original code fragment `/\n/g` matches any newline character.

DONE.
