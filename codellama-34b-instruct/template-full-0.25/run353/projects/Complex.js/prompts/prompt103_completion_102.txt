  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called more frequently, leading to a higher likelihood of the code failing to parse certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called less frequently, leading to a lower likelihood of the code failing to parse certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called more frequently, leading to a higher likelihood of the code failing to parse certain inputs.

DONE.
