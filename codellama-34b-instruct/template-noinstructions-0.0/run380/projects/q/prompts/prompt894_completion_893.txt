  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null, 1)` would return a new function that always slices the input array starting from the second element, whereas `array_slice` would return a new function that slices the input array starting from the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null, 0, 1)` would return a new function that always slices the input array starting from the first element and ending at the second element, whereas `array_slice` would return a new function that slices the input array starting from the first element and ending at the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, 1, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `
