 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(this.verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over all the keys in the `verbs` object, rather than the provided `verbs` array-like argument. This could lead to unexpected behavior when adding or removing verbs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the `verbs` object, which would prevent the original `verbs` object from being modified. This could lead to unexpected behavior when trying to modify the `verbs` object within the `deny` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.verbs.filter(verb => verbs.includes(verb))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter the `verbs` object to only include the verbs provided in the `verbs` array-
