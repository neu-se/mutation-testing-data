  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1 || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plus + minus === 0` check would be bypassed, leading to a different parsing logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 2 || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plus + minus === 0` check would be bypassed, leading to a different parsing logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 3 || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plus + minus === 0` check would be bypassed, leading to a different parsing logic.

DONE.
