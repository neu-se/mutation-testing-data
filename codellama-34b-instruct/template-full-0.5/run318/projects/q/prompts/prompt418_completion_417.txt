  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for a pending promise, regardless of whether it has been resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for a rejected promise, regardless of whether it has been resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for a fulfilled promise, regardless of whether it has been resolved or rejected.

DONE.
