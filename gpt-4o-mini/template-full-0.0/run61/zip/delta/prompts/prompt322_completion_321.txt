Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index of the slice, potentially skipping the first element and including additional elements, which alters the intended range of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex);
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty slice, meaning no operations would be processed, effectively ignoring the current operation and leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex - 1, baseIndex + length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly starts the slice one index before the intended baseIndex, potentially including unintended elements and altering the logic of the operation being performed.

DONE.
