  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'drain'` is an event that is emitted when the write stream is drained, while `'error'` is an event that is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'close'` is an event that is emitted when the write stream is closed, while `'error'` is an event that is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'finish'` is an event that is emitted when the write stream is finished, while `'error'` is an event that is emitted when an error occurs.

DONE.
