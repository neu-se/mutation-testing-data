  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the original code, causing the divisor to be Infinity even when it should not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return Infinity even when the divisor is not Infinity, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, 'isInfinite')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would look for the 'isInfinite' property on the prototype chain, rather than on the current object.

DONE.
