  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the number of arguments passed to the `pull` function, and adding 1 to it would cause the function to expect one more argument than it actually receives.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the number of arguments passed to the `pull` function, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the function to expect one fewer argument than it actually receives.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the number of arguments passed to the `pull` function, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the function to expect twice as many arguments as it actually receives.

DONE.
