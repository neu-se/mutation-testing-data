  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object' && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object or null, while this replacement checks if `a` is not an object and not null. This would cause the `throw` statement to be executed even if `a` is not null, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null && typeof a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object or null, while this replacement checks if `a` is not null and not an object. This would cause the `throw` statement to be executed even if `a` is null, which is not the intended behavior.
