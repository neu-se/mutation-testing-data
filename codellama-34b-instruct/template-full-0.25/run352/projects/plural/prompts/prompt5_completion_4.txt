  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(Object.prototype.toString)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value (in this case, `Object.prototype.toString`). This means that the `toString` method will always be called on the `Object.prototype` object, regardless of the object that is passed to the `plural` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(Object.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value (in this case, `Object.prototype`). This means that the `toString` method will always be called on the `Object.prototype` object, regardless of the object that is passed to the `plural` function.
