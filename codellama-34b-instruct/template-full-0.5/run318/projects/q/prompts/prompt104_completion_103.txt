  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `index + 1` would cause the `array_reduce` function to start iterating over the array from the second element instead of the first, which would lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `index - 1` would cause the `array_reduce` function to start iterating over the array from the last element instead of the first, which would lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` would cause the `array_reduce` function to start iterating over the array from the first element instead of the second, which would lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
