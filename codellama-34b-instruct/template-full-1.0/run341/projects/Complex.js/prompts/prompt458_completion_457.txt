  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` returns a boolean indicating whether a value is NaN, while `isInfinite` returns a boolean indicating whether a value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` is a property of the `Complex` class representing the imaginary part of the complex number, while `isInfinite` is a method that checks whether the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` is a property of the `Complex` class representing the real part of the complex number, while `isInfinite` is a method that checks whether the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

DONE.
