  Sure! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain - (otherOp.retain || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not always present in the `otherOp` object, so we need to check for its presence before subtracting it from `thisOp.retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain - (thisOp.retain || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because we are subtracting `thisOp.retain` from `otherOp.retain`, which would change the order of operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain - otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because we are not checking for the presence of the `retain` property in `otherOp`, so we may be subtracting `undefined` from `thisOp.
