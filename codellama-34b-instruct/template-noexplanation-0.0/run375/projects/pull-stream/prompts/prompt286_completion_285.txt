  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This code fragment is a negation of the `end` variable, which means that the `data` variable will be set to `null` if `end` is not true, and to `mapper(data)` if `end` is true. This change inverts the behavior of the original code, which sets `data` to `null` if `end` is true, and to `mapper(data)` if `end` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && mapper(data)
```
This code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) to check if `end` is true and `mapper(data)` is not null. If both conditions are true, the `data` variable will be set to `mapper(data)`. This change in the code introduces a new condition that was not present in the original code, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail if the `mapper` function is not properly tested.
