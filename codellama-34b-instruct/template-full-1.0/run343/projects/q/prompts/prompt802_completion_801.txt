  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` inside the `then` method refers to the promise itself, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause an error when `progressed` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause an error when `progressed` is called.

DONE.
