  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `currentUrl` object would not be created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to `undefined`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and the `currentUrl` object would be created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = "http://example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to a string, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and the `currentUrl` object would be created.

DONE.
