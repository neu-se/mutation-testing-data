  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `void 0`, and it would cause the `apply` method to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to receive a different set of arguments, and the `null` value would be passed as the `this` value, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to receive a different set of arguments, and the `void 0` value would be passed as the `this` value, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
