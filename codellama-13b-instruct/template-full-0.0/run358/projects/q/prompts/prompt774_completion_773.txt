  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `promises` array, rather than the array itself. This could cause issues if the code relies on the array being passed to the `allResolved` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array, rather than the original `promises` array. This could cause issues if the code relies on the array being passed to the `allResolved` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `undefined`, rather than the original `promises` array. This could cause issues if the code relies on the array being passed to the `allResolved` function.

DONE.
