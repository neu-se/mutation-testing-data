  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `1` if `places` is falsy, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `10` instead of `0` when `places` is `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `0` if `places` is falsy, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `0` instead of `10` when `places` is `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ? 0 : 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would return `0` if `places` is falsy, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `0` instead of `10
