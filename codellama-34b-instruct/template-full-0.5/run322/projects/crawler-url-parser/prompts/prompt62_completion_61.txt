  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of `parsedUrl` is not the same as the `query` property, and it is not clear why the developer chose to use `query` instead of `search`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.query
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` property of `parsedUrl` is not the same as the `search` property, and it is not clear why the developer chose to use `search` instead of `query`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.query.split("=")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` property of `parsedUrl` is a string, and the `split` method is not defined for strings.

DONE.
