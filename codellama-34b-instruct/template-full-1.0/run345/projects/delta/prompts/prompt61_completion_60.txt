  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes !== null && attributes.length > 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the check for the `attributes` being an object, which could result in an error if `attributes` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null && attributes.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the check for the `attributes` being an object, and it would also replace `Object.keys(attributes).length` with `attributes.length`, which could result in a different behavior if `attributes` is not an array or a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes !== null && Object.keys(attributes).length > 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the check for the `attributes` being an object with a check for the `attributes` having more than one key.

DONE.
