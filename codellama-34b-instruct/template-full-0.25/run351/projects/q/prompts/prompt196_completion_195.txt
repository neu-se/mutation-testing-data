  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first element of the array returned by `getFileNameAndLineNumber`, which is the file name, and not the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the second element of the array returned by `getFileNameAndLineNumber`, which is the line number, and not the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third element of the array returned by `getFileNameAndLineNumber`, which is not a valid index.

DONE.
