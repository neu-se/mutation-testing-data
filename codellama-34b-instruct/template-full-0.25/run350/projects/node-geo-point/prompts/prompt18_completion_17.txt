  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the input is an object, while this code checks if the input is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the input has a property called 'latitude', while this code checks if the input has a property called 'longitude'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the input has a property called 'type', while this code checks if the input has a property called 'coordinates'.

DONE.
