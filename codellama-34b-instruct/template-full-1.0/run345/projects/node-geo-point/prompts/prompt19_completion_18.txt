  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isComparable
```
This would result in different behavior because `isObject` checks if an object is a value, whereas `isComparable` checks if an object is comparable to another using the `==` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `value !== null` checks if a value is not null, whereas `isObject` checks if a value is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Object]'` checks if a value is an object using a more reliable method than `isObject`.

DONE.
