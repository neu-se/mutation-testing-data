  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'people')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a function call `addRule` with two parameters, while the new code uses a function call `addRule` with only one parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a function call `addRule` with two parameters, while the new code uses a function call `addRule` with only one parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', function() {
  return 'people';
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a function call `addRule` with two parameters, while the new code uses a function call `addRule` with two parameters, but without the first parameter being a string.

DONE.
