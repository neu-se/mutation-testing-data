Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from the original `args` to `null`, which may cause the dispatched method to receive incorrect or unexpected parameters, potentially leading to errors or different execution paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the parameters, sending `args` as the first element and `name` as the second, which could lead to the method being invoked with the wrong context or arguments, resulting in incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, [1, 2, 3]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the dynamic `args` with a static array `[1, 2, 3]`, which means that the method will always be called with the same arguments regardless of what was originally intended, potentially leading to incorrect results or behavior.

DONE.
