  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the two inserts are equal, while this new fragment checks whether they are inequal. This could cause the test to produce false positives or false negatives.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.insert !== typeof otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the two inserts are of the same type (string or object), while this new fragment checks whether they are of different types. This could cause the test to produce false positives or false negatives.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.insert !== typeof otherOp.insert && thisOp.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the two inserts are of the same type (string or object), while this new fragment checks whether they are of different types and
