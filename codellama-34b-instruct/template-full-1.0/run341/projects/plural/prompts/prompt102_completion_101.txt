  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the rule to words that end in "y" or "x," while this code fragment would apply the rule to any word that contains the letter "i," which would result in many more words being pluralized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(\bi\b|\bi\bi)/i, function(
