  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(newOp.insert === lastOp.insert){ ... }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code in the block if the insert property of newOp and lastOp are equal. In contrast, the original code fragment code uses a more generic approach by using the isEqual function to determine if newOp and lastOp are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(newOp.insert !== lastOp.insert){ ... }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code in the block if the insert property of newOp and lastOp are not equal. In contrast, the original code fragment code uses a more generic approach by using the isEqual function to determine if newOp and lastOp are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(lastOp.retain !== newOp.retain){ ... }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code in the block if the retain
