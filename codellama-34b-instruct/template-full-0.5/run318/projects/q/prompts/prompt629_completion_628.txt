  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the setter function to assign the value to the wrong property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is the same as the key, which would cause the setter function to essentially do nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is the same as the value being passed to the setter function, which would cause the setter function to essentially do nothing.

DONE.
