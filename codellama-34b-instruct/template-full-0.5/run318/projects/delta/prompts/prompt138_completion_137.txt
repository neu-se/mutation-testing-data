  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator is used instead of `<=`, which would cause the loop to continue even if the `firstLeft` threshold is exceeded, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() < firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator is used instead of `<=`, which would cause the loop to terminate prematurely if the `firstLeft` threshold is not met, potentially resulting in a partially composed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() === firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `<=
