  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType()` would return the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `iter.peek()` would return the next operation itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` would return the next operation in the iterator, while `iter.peek()` would return the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek().type
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek().type` would return the type of the current operation, while `iter.peekType()` would return the type of the next operation.

DONE.
