  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comma-separated list of two variables, while the buggy code fragment is a single variable. This could cause issues if the code is expecting a list of two variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comma-separated list of two variables, while the buggy code fragment is a single variable. This could cause issues if the code is expecting a list of two variables.
