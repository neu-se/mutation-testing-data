  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is used instead of the `b` variable, which would cause the code to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b + 1` expression is used instead of the `b` variable, which would cause the code to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b * 2` expression is used instead of the `b` variable, which would cause the code to return a different result.

DONE.
