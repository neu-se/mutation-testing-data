  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a positive number, even if the imaginary part of the complex number is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a smaller number than the original code, which could lead to errors in applications that rely on the correct calculation of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a positive number, even if the imaginary part of the complex number is negative.

DONE.
