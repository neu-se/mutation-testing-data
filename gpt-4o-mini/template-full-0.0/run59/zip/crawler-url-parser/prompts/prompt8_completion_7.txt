Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.length < 5
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of `baseUrlStr` is less than 5 instead of checking for illegal characters, potentially allowing invalid URLs to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!baseUrlStr.includes('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `baseUrlStr` does not include 'http', which would incorrectly allow URLs that are valid but do not start with 'http' or 'https' to be considered illegal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `baseUrlStr` is strictly equal to `null`, which would bypass the illegal character check entirely if `baseUrlStr` is an empty string or any other falsy value.

DONE.
