  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because "allSettled" is a different method than "allResolved" and would return a promise for an array of promises in a different state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"any"
```
This would result in different behavior because "any" is a different method than "allResolved" and would return a promise for the first resolved promise in an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"all"
```
This would result in different behavior because "all" is a different method than "allResolved" and would return a promise for an array of promises that are all fulfilled.

DONE.
