  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op !== "when" && operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` parameter is no longer checked for the specific value of "when", and the `operands` array is now being checked for a value at index 1, which may not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operands` array is now being checked for a value at index 0, which may not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operands` array is now being checked for a value at index 2, which may not exist.

DONE.
