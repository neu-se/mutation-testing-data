  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite()` checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero()` checks if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero()` checks if both the real and imaginary parts are zero, while `this['re'] === 0` only checks if the real part is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero()` checks if both the real and imaginary parts are zero, while `this['im'] === 0` only checks if the imaginary part is zero.

DONE.
