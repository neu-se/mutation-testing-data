  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(0 === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, even if the intended logic of the code is to check if exports and module are objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(typeof exports !== "undefined" && typeof module !== "undefined")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if exports and module are both defined, but it would not check if they are objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(typeof exports === "undefined" && typeof module === "undefined")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if exports and module are undefined, but it would not check if they are objects.

DONE.
