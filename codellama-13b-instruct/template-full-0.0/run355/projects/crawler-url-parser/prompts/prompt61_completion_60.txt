  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, result_normalize_options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result_normalize_options` object is used to specify the normalization options for the URL, which would affect the output of the `URL.format` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is used as the second argument to the `URL.format` function, which would not apply any normalization options to the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.format` function is called without any arguments, which would result in the URL being formatted without any normalization options.

DONE.
