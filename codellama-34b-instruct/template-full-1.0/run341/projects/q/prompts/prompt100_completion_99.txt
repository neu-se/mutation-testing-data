  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
! foo[bar]
```
This would result in different behavior because `! foo[bar]` would always return `false` when `bar` refers to an existing property in the `foo` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bar.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `bar.length` would always be `undefined` when `bar` refers to an existing property in the `foo` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{} + bar
```
This would result in different behavior because `{} + bar` would always return a string concatenation of `bar` with the string representation of an empty object.

DONE.
