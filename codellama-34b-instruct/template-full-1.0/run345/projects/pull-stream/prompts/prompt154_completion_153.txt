  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, but `onAbort` is a callback function that is expected to be called when the `abort` parameter is truthy. Using `undefined` instead of `onAbort` would cause the callback to be skipped, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, but `onAbort` is a callback function that is expected to be called when the `abort` parameter is truthy. Using `null` instead of `onAbort` would cause the callback to be skipped, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => {}` is a new, empty arrow function that is not the same as the original `on
