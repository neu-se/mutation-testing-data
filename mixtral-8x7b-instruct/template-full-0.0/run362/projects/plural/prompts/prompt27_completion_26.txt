 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the word instead of the last two characters, changing the pluralization rule for words that maintain latin/greek plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that maintain latin/greek plural.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number between 0 and the length of the word, which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that maintain latin/greek plural.

DONE.
