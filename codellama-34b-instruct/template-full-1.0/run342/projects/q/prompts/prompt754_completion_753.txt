  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a method that returns a promise and the original code was not calling a method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a constant value that evaluates to `undefined` and the original code was not using a constant value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is a method that returns a rejected promise and the original code was not returning a rejected promise.

DONE.
