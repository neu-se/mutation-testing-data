  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment checks whether the `array` variable is an array, but the original code fragment checks whether it is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment checks whether the first element of the `array` variable is not an array, but the original code fragment checks whether the `array` variable is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment checks whether the `array` variable is undefined, but the original code fragment checks whether it is not an array.

DONE.
