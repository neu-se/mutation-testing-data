 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(this.verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the provided `verbs` array-like argument. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the order of iteration is different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.verbs.filter(verb => verbs.includes(verb))
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters the `verbs` object to only include the verbs provided in the `verbs` array-like argument. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `verbs` object contains more verbs than the ones provided in the `verbs` array-like argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.verbs.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `verbs` object,
