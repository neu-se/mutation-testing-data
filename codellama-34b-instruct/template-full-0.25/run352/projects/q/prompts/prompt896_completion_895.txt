  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this replacement code fragment creates a deferred object with a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this replacement code fragment creates a deferred object with an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this replacement code fragment creates a deferred object with a new error object.

DONE.
