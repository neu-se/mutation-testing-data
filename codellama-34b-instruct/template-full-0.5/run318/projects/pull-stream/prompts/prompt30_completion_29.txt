  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed would be different. In the original code, the index is `2`, but in the mutated code, it is `3`. This could cause the function to access a different element of the array, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed would be different. In the original code, the index is `2`, but in the mutated code, it is `2 + 1`, which is `3`. This could cause the function to access a different element of the array, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed would be different. In the original code, the index is `2`, but
