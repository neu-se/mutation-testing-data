  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const point2Rad = deg2rad(point2.latitude) - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the calculation of `point2Rad` to be off by one radian, which could potentially result in a significant difference in the calculated distances and bearings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const point2Rad = deg2rad(point2.latitude) + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the calculation of `point2Rad` to be off by one radian in the opposite direction, which could potentially result in a significant difference in the calculated distances and bearings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const point2Rad = deg2rad(point2.latitude) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the calculation of `point2Rad` to be twice the value
