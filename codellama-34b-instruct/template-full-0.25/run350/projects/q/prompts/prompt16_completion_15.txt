  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used instead of `||`, which would cause the code to only execute if both `window` and `self` are defined, rather than if either one is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" ^ typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator is used instead of `||`, which would cause the code to only execute if one of `window` or `self` is defined, but not both.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" || typeof self !== "undefined" || typeof global !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used to check if either `window`, `self`, or `global` is defined, rather than just `window` or `self`.
