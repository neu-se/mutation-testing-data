  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw 'error'; }, void 0, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to `Q.progress` would be a function that throws an error, unlike the original code which passed `void 0` (a.k.a. `undefined`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, function () { return null; }, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `Q.progress` would be a function that returns `null`, unlike the original code which passed `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, function () { return progressed; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `Q.progress` would be a function that returns the `progressed` value, unlike the original code which passed `void 0`.

DONE.
