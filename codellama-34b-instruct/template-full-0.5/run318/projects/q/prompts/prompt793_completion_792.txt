  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `undefined` as the second argument to `then()`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by `progressed()`, while the new code fragment has `void 0` as the second argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(progressed, void 0, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `undefined` as the first and third arguments to `then()`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by `progressed()`, while the new code fragment has `progressed` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by `progressed()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0
