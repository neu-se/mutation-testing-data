  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` does not return a new array, while `map` returns a new array with the transformed elements. Therefore, if the code relies on the returned array, it would produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a filtered array, while `map` returns a new array with the transformed elements. Therefore, if the code relies on the returned array, it would produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a single value, while `map` returns a new array with the transformed elements. Therefore, if the code relies on the returned array, it would produce different results.

DONE.
