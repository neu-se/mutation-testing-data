  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const {createWriteStream} = require('fs');
```
This would result in different behavior because it imports the `createWriteStream` functionality from the `fs` module, which is not the same as the original code fragment, which is a method call on the `createWriteStream` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const stream = require('fs');
```
This would result in different behavior because it imports the entire `fs` module as a stream, whereas the original code fragment only imported the `createWriteStream` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const {createWriteStream} = require('follow-redirects');
```
This would result in different behavior because it imports the `createWriteStream` functionality from the `follow-redirects` module, which is not the same as the original code fragment, which imported from the `fs` module.

DONE.
