  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
   parser_exit = 0;
``` 
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to exit with a return value of 0, which would indicate success to the caller, regardless of whether the input string was actually parsed successfully or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
   parser_exit = "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to exit with a return value of "foo", which is a string, and not a number, so it would not be a valid return value for the parser.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    z['im'] = 999999;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the imaginary part of the complex number to be parsed to an absurdly large value, which would not be a valid value for a complex number.

DONE.
