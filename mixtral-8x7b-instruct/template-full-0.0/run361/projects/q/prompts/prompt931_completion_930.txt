 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.denodeify.bind(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` within the `denodeify` function. The original code uses `apply` to explicitly set the value of `this` to `Q`, while the modified code uses `bind` to create a new function with a pre-set `this` value. This could lead to unexpected results if the `denodeify` function relies on the value of `this` being set to `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.denodeify.call(null)
