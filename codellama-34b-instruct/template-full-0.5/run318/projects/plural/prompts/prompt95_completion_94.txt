  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?woman$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches strings that end with "man" or "woman," while the new code fragment only matches strings that end with "woman."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-insensitive, while the new code fragment is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches strings that end with "man" or "woman," while the new code fragment only matches strings that end with "man."

DONE.
