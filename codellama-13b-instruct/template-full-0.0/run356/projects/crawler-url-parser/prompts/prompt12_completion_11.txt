  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would be parsed as an HTTPS URL instead of an HTTP URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would be parsed as an FTP URL instead of an HTTP URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'//'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would be parsed as a protocol-relative URL instead of an HTTP URL.

DONE.
