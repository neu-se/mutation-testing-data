  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, '$$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `$$` would be interpreted as a single dollar sign, rather than a backreference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, '$$$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `$$$` would be interpreted as a single dollar sign, followed by a backreference to the first capturing group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, '$$$$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `$$$$` would be interpreted as a single dollar sign, followed by a backreference to the second capturing group.

DONE.
