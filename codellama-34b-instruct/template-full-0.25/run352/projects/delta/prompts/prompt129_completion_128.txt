  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different amount than the original code, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(start - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different amount than the original code, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - start)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different amount than the original code, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
