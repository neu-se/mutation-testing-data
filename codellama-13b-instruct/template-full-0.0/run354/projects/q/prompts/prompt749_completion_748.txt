  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property of the `result` object is not guaranteed to be present, and may be `undefined` or `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value || result.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property of the `result` object is not guaranteed to be present, and may be `undefined` or `null`. The `reason` property, on the other hand, is guaranteed to be present and may contain an error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value || result.reason || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property of the `result` object is not guaranteed to be present, and may be `undefined` or `null`. The `reason` property, on the other hand, is guaranteed to be present and may contain an error message. The `null` value is used as a fallback in
