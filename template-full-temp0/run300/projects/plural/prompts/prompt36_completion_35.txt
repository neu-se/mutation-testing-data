  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment is subtracting 1. This would cause the plural form of words that end in "is" to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment is adding 1. This would cause the plural form of words that end in "is" to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment is multiplying the length by 2. This would cause the plural form of words that end in "is" to be incorrect.
