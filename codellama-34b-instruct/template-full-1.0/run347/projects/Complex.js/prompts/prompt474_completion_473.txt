  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinity` checks whether a value is positive or negative infinity, whereas `isNaN` checks whether a value is Not-a-Number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks whether a value is a finite number, whereas `isNaN` checks whether a value is Not-a-Number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isFinite` checks whether a value is not a finite number, whereas `isNaN` checks whether a value is Not-a-Number.

DONE.
