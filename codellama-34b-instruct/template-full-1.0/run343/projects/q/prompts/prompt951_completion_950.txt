  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(nodeArgs);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the arguments to the console, whereas the original code passes them to the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a `null` value, whereas the original code returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, whereas the original code returns a promise that may resolve or reject.

DONE.
