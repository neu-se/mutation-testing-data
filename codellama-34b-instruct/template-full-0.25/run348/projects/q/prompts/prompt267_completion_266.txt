  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because `become` is a function that takes a promise as an argument, but `reject` is a function that takes a reason as an argument and returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a function that takes a value as an argument and returns a promise, but `reject` is a function that takes a reason as an argument and returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a function that takes a value as an argument and returns a promise, but `reject` is a function that takes a reason as an argument and returns a promise.

DONE.
