  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!result[country]` checks if the `country` property is not defined in the `result` object, while the new code fragment `result[country]` checks if the `country` property is defined in the `result` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.hasOwnProperty(country)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!result[country]` checks if the `country` property is not defined in the `result` object, while the new code fragment `result.hasOwnProperty(country)` checks if the `country` property is defined in the `result` object and is an own property of the `result` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(result, country)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!result[country]` checks
