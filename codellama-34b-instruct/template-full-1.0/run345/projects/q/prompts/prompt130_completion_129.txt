  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the character 'a' instead of the actual key of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the key of the current element plus the character '1', which would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, which would be incorrect.

DONE.
