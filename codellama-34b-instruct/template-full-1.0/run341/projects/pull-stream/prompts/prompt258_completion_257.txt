  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err != true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `null` and `undefined` values as errors, while the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat any truthy value as an error, while the original code would only treat `true` as an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only treat `false` values as errors, while the original code would treat any truthy value as an error.

DONE.
