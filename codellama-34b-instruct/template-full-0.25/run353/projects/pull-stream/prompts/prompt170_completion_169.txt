  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `cb(false)` is a function call with a different argument. This change would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with a single argument, while `cb(null, array[i++])` is a function call with two arguments. This change would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with a single argument, while `cb(null, array[i++])` is a function call
