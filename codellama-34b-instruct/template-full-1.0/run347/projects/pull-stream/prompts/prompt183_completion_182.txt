  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause the function to return a truthy value in the last iteration, which is not the desired behavior. The original code fragment `i >= array.length` is more robust and will handle the case where the input array is empty correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause the function to return a falsy value in all iterations, which will cause the callback to be called with a null value. The original code fragment `i >= array.length` is more robust and will handle the case where the input array is empty correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause the function to return a truthy value in the first iteration, which is not the desired behavior. The original code fragment `i >= array.length` is more robust and will handle the
