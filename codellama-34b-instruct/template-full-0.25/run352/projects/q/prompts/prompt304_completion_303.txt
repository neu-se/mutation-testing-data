  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error or unintended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, potentially causing the code to fail to function as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, potentially causing the code to function differently than intended.

DONE.
