  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.call(arguments, 1)` is not equivalent to `array_slice(arguments, 1)`. The former calls `array_slice` with `arguments` as its context (i.e., `this` value), while the latter calls it with the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode) as its context. The resulting array would have different contents in each case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments).reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, while `array_slice(arguments, 1)` returns a slice of the array starting from the second element. The reversed array would have a different order of elements in each case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
