  Sorry for the confusion. I'm just an AI and I do not have the capability to "DONE" unlike my mainframe AI partners. Here are the suggested code fragments for the intended purpose you described:

 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.val()
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.val()` is not a valid method for the `stream` object, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.objects
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.objects` is not a valid property for the `stream` object, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_stream
```
This would result in different behavior because `_stream` is not a valid variable name, which would cause an error.

Please consider the above-suggested code fragments as possible answers for the intended purpose described.
