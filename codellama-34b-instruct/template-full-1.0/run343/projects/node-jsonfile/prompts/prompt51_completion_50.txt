  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces + 1` would cause the stringified object to have one more space than the original code, which could break code that relies on the exact formatting of the stringified object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, "invalid")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `"invalid"` argument is not a valid value for the `spaces` parameter, and would cause an error when the `stringify` function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, spaces)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` argument for the `replacer` parameter would ignore any custom replacer functions and use the default implementation, which could break code that relies on the custom replacer.

DONE.
