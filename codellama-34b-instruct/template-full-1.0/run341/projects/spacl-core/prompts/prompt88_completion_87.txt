  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy, policy]
```
This would result in different behavior because the map function does not return the correct key/value pair.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned is null, not the expected Policy object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned is an empty object, not the expected Policy object.

DONE.
