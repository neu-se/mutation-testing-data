  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is attempting to calculate the result of division by zero, which leads to unexpected results in JS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return a + b;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is performing complex number operations, while the suggested replacement is simply adding two numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return a - b;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is performing complex number operations, while the suggested replacement is simply subtracting two numbers.

DONE.
