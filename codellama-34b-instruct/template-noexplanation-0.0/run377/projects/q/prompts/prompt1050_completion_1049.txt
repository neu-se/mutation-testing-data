  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This change will cause the `put` method to reject the promise instead of resolving it, which will result in the `get` method returning a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(null)
```
This change will cause the `put` method to resolve the promise with a null value instead of the expected object, which will result in the `get` method returning a resolved promise with a null value instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(Q.reject(error))
```
This change will cause the `put` method to resolve the promise with a rejected promise instead of the expected object, which will result in the `get` method returning a resolved promise with a rejected promise instead of the expected object.

DONE.
