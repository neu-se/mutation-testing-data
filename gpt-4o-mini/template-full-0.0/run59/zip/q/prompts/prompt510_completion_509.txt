Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only apply the first argument from the `args` array instead of all arguments, potentially leading to incorrect results when multiple arguments are expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the `apply` method, which would cause the function to be called with a `null` context, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior if the function relies on a specific `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` to the `apply` method, which could lead to similar issues as passing `null`, where the function may not behave as intended if it expects a valid context or arguments.

DONE.
