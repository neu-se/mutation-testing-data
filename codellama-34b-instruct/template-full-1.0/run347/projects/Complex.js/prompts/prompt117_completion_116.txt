  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform an addition operation instead of a multiplication.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a logical OR operation instead of a multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ? b : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only perform the multiplication when `a` is truthy, and would return 0 otherwise.

DONE.
