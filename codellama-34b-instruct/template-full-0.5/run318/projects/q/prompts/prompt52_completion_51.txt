  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that takes no arguments, so passing `flush` as an argument would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function(){flush();});
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that takes no arguments, so wrapping it in an anonymous function that takes no arguments would cause it to be called with no arguments, which would not be the same as calling it with the `requestTick` function as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function(){flush(laterQueue);});
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that takes a single argument, which is the `laterQueue` array. Wrapping it in an anonymous function that takes no arguments would cause it to be called with no arguments, which would not be the same as calling it with
