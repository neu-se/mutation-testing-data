  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.catch` is not a valid method in the `Promise` class, and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.reject` is not a valid method in the `Promise` class, and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.resolve` is not a valid method in the `Promise` class, and would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
