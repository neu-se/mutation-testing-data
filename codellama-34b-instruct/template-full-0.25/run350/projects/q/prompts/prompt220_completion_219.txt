  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.longStackSupport` property would be set to `true` even if the `process.env.Q_DEBUG` property is not defined, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.env.Q_DEBUG === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.longStackSupport` property would be set to `true` even if the `process.env.Q_DEBUG` property is not defined, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.env.Q_DEBUG === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.longStackSupport` property would be set to `true` even if the `process.env.Q_DEBUG` property is not an object, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE
