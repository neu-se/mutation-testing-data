  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the `sink` function to exit immediately, rather than continuing to read data from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Aborting')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown, rather than setting the `abort` flag to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error(doneLackingErr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.error` call would log an error message to the console, rather than throwing an error.

DONE.
