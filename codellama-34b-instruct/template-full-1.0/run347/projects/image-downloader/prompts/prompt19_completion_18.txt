  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to continue executing even if the destination path is not absolute, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the parent directory of the destination path, rather than the destination path itself, which could lead to errors if the path is not absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the base name of the destination path, rather than the destination path itself, which could lead to errors if the path is not absolute.

DONE.
