  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set in the `process.env` object, while the new code fragment checks if the `process` variable is undefined. If the `process` variable is undefined, it will evaluate to `true` and enable long stack traces, even if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is not set.

DONE.
