  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable directly, while this replacement uses the lowercase version of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable directly, while this replacement uses the uppercase version of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable directly, while this replacement uses the substring of the word starting from the second character.

DONE.
