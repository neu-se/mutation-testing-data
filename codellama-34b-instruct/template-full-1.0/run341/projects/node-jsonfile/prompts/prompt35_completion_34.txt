  Sure, here are three options for mutating the code in the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"wrong"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would return the string "wrong" instead of the stringified JSON object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would return null instead of the stringified JSON object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse("wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` would attempt to parse the string "wrong" as JSON, which would result in a syntax error.

DONE.
