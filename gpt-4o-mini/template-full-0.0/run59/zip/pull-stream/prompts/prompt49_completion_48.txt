Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the loop condition to include the last index, which could lead to an attempt to access an undefined argument when `i` equals `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it reduces the upper limit of the loop, causing the loop to skip the last argument, which may lead to incomplete processing of the provided arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < length; i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` by 2 on each iteration, effectively skipping every other argument, which could lead to incorrect handling of the input arguments.

DONE.
