  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different subset of the arguments array, as the [1] index would be accessed instead of the [0] index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the array instead of a subset of the arguments array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a shallow copy of the array instead of a subset of the arguments array.

DONE.
