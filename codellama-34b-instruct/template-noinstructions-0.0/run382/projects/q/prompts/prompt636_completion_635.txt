  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `del` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object, which would not have the desired effect of deleting a property from the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `del` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object, which would not have the desired effect of deleting a property from the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `del` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object, which would not have the desired effect of deleting a property from the object.

DONE.
