  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(z['re']) && isNaN(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `z['re']` or `z['im']` is NaN, while this new code fragment checks if both `z['re']` and `z['im']` are NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(z['re']) || isFinite(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `z['re']` or `z['im']` is NaN, while this new code fragment checks if either `z['re']` or `z['im']` is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(z['re']) && !isNaN(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `z['re']` or `z['im
