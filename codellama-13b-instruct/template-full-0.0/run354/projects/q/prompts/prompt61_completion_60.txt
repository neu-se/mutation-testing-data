  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function would not be defined, and the code would throw an error when trying to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function would not be called, and the code would not throw an error. However, the `flush` function would not be called either, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function would be called, and the code would not throw an error. However, the `flush` function would be called immediately, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
