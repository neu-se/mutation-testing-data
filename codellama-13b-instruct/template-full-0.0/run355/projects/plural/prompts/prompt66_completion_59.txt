  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "memo" with the plural form "memos", while the buggy code fragment adds a rule for the word "memo" with the plural form "memos" again, which is redundant and would not cause any issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memorandum')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "memo" with the plural form "memos", while the buggy code fragment adds a rule for the word "memo" with the plural form "memorandum", which would cause the plural form of "memo" to be "memorandums" instead of "memos".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memorandums')
