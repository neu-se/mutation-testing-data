  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function `gettype` always return "internal", regardless of the input URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function `gettype` always return "external", regardless of the input URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `gettype` would throw a TypeError when trying to access the `subdomain` property of `pageurl`, which is null.

DONE.
