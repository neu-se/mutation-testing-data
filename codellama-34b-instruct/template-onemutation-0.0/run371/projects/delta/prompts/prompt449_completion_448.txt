  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.delete` is a number, while the new code fragment checks if it is not a number. This change would cause the `peekType()` method to return `'insert'` instead of `'delete'` when `op.delete` is not a number, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the program.

DONE.
