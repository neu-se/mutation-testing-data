  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because without the `this` keyword, the code would be trying to return a property of the `Promise` object, rather than the `object` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.inspect` is a method of the `Promise` object, and calling it without the `this` keyword would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a method of the `Promise` object that resolves a promise with the given value. Without the `this` keyword, the code would be trying to return a property of the `Promise` object, rather than resolving a promise.

DONE.
