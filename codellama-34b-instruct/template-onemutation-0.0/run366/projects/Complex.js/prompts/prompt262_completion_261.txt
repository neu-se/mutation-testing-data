  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function, which computes the arctangent of the ratio of its arguments, while the replacement code fragment uses the `+` operator, which computes the sum of its arguments. These operations have different behavior for certain input values, such as when `a` and `b` are both zero.
