  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second operand instead of the first to the progress listener.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first operand instead of the second to the progress listener.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the operands array instead of an element of the array to the progress listener.

DONE.
