  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have a `null` value at the end, which would cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have an `undefined` value at the end, which would cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method would be called with a `null` value, which would cause it to return a resolver function that always returns `null`, regardless of the input. This would cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

DONE.
