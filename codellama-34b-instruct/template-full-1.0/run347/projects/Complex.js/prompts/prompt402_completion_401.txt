  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logMinus
```
This would result in different behavior because `logMinus` is a different method than `logHypot`. While `logHypot` calculates the base-2 logarithm of a number, `logMinus` calculates the base-2 logarithm of the negative of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logPlus
```
This would result in different behavior because `logPlus` is a different method than `logHypot`. While `logHypot` calculates the base-2 logarithm of a number, `logPlus` calculates the base-2 logarithm of the positive of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logOne
```
This would result in different behavior because `logOne` is a different method than `logHypot`. While `logHypot` calculates the base-2 logarithm of a number, `logOne` calculates the
