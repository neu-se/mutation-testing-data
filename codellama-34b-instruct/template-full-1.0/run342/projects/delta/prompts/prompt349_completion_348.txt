  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `AttributeMap.invert` method would not be called, and the resulting delta would not have the same attributes as the original one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `handler.invert` method would not be called, and the resulting delta would not have the same attributes as the original one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform(opData, baseOpData, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `AttributeMap.transform` method would not be called, and the resulting delta would not have the same attributes as the original one.

DONE.
