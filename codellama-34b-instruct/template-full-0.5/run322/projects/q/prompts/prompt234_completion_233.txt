  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `if (messages)` check would fail, and the `else` block would be executed, which would result in the `resolvedPromise` being dispatched with the current value of `messages`, which would be an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
