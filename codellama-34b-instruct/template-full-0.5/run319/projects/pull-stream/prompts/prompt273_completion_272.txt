  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' !== typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is a function, while this new code fragment checks if `stream` is a string. This change would cause the `nextStream` function to be called more frequently, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'number' !== typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is a function, while this new code fragment checks if `stream` is a number. This change would cause the `nextStream` function to be called less frequently, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'object' === typeof stream && !('function' in stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is a function, while this new code fragment checks if `stream`
