  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a function, while the replaced code fragment is a function call, which would result in a different value being passed to the `setTimeout` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a function, while the replaced code fragment is a function call with a `null` argument, which would result in a different value being passed to the `setTimeout` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a function, while the replaced code fragment is a function call with an empty function as an argument, which would result in a different value being passed to the `setTimeout` function.

DONE.
