 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'games'.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the `addRule` call would not match the uppercase version of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
games.concat('notgames')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the `addRule` call would match the concatenated string, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['games']
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the `addRule` call would match the array, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
