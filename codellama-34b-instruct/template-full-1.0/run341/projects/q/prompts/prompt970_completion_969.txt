  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"nmake"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "nmake" method is not defined in the code, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"npost"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "npost" method is not defined in the code, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` at runtime.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ninvoke"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "ninvoke" method is not defined in the code, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` at runtime.

DONE.
