  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(error) {
    Q.nextTick(function() {
        nodeback(error.message);
    });
}
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the `nodeback` function with the `error` object as an argument, it would call it with the error message. This would cause the promise to be rejected with the error message, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(error) {
    Q.nextTick(function() {
        nodeback(error);
    });
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `nodeback` function with the `error` object as an argument, but it would do so asynchronously using `Q.nextTick`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(error) {
    nodeback(error);
}
```
This would result in different behavior
