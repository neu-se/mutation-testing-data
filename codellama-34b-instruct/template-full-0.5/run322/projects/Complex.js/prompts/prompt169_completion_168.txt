  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']() || this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the operands, potentially causing the `div` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require both operands to be zero and infinite, which would never occur in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']() || this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
