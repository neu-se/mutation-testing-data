  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "d"
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operator `+` has higher precedence than the `delete` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `"delete" + "d"` instead of `delete d`. This would result in a different value being passed to the `dispatch` method, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
