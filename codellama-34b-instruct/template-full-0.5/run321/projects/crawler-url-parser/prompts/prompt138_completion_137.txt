  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the index file extension from the URL, which could cause the code to look for a different file or directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/index\.[a-z]+$/, 'index.html'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the index.html file extension to the URL, which could cause the code to look for a different file or directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/index\.[a-z]+$/, 'index.htm'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the index.htm file extension to the URL, which could cause the code to look for a different file or directory.

DONE.
