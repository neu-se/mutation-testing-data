  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `priority` variable, causing the `if` condition to always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` variable would be incremented by 1, potentially causing the `if` condition to evaluate to `true` even if it was previously `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` variable would be multiplied by 2, potentially causing the `if` condition to evaluate to `true` even if it was previously `false`.

DONE.
