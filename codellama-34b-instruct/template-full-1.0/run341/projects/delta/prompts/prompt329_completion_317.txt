  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether `op.retain` is truthy and `op.attributes` is not `null`, while the replaced code is only checking whether `op.retain` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain ? op.attributes : op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether `op.retain` is truthy, while the replaced code is checking whether `op.retain` is truthy and `op.attributes` is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes && op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether `op.attributes` is `null` before checking whether `op.retain` is truthy, while the replaced code is checking whether `op.retain` is truthy before checking
