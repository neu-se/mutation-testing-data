  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the current operation starting from the current offset, rather than the length of the entire operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.ops[this.index].length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the current operation starting from the beginning, rather than the length of the entire operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.ops[this.index + 1].length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next operation, rather than the length of the current operation.

DONE.
