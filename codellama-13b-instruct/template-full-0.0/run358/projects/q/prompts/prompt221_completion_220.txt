  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create(null)` creates a new object with no prototype, whereas `object_create(Promise.prototype)` creates a new object with the prototype of the `Promise` constructor. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the prototype chain of the `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(null)` creates a new object with no prototype, whereas `object_create(Promise.prototype)` creates a new object with the prototype of the `Promise` constructor. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the prototype chain of the `Promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.prototype` is the prototype of the `Promise` constructor, whereas `
