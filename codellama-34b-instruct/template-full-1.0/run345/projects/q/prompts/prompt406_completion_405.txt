  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promise).thenResolve(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` would always return a resolved promise with the value of `reason`, regardless of the state of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promise).thenReject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` would always return a rejected promise with the reason of `reason`, regardless of the state of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promise).then(function() { throw reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always throw the reason, regardless of the state of `promise`.

DONE.
