 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` might not refer to the correct object in the new function's context, while the original code fragment `self, args` passes the correct `self` (which is the resolved value of the promise) and `args` to the inner function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `self` would cause the inner function to lose the reference to the resolved value of the promise, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors in the inner function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty array `[]` instead of `self` would cause the inner function to lose the reference to the resolved value of the promise, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors in the inner function.

DONE.
