  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous token instead of the next token.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the token after the next token instead of the next token.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the current token instead of the next token.

DONE.
