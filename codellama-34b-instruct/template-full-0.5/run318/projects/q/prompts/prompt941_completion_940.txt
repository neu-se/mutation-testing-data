  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the array slice, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra `null` element to the end of the array slice, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function() { return false; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all elements from the array slice, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
