  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, this._data.get(key)
```
This change will cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the keys in the `_data` map, and for each key, it will call the `fn` function with the key and the value associated with that key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val
```
This change will cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the keys in the `_data` map, and for each key, it will call the `fn` function with the key and the value associated with that key. However, this change will not have any effect on the behavior of the `forEach` method, as the `key` and `val` variables are already being passed to the `fn` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, this._data.get(key)
```
This change will cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the keys in the `_data` map, and for each key, it will call
