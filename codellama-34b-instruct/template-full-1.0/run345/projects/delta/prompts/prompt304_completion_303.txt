  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return the next line, regardless of whether a newline character was found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the line before the newline character, instead of the line after it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in the function returning the current line, without advancing to the next one.

DONE.
