  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any value of `baseUrlStr`, regardless of whether it contains illegal characters or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for any value of `baseUrlStr`, regardless of whether it contains illegal characters or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.includes(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any value of `baseUrlStr` that contains a colon, regardless of whether it contains illegal characters or not.

DONE.
