  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a division by zero, which would cause the program to crash, instead of returning the complex inverse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a negative value, which would cause the program to return a different complex number, instead of the complex inverse.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a different value, which would cause the program to return a different complex number, instead of the complex inverse.

DONE.
