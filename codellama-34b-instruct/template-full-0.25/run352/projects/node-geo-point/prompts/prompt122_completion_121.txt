  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while the new code fragment is using the `null` keyword, which would result in a different object being passed to the `calculateBearing` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while the new code fragment is using the `undefined` keyword, which would result in a different object being passed to the `calculateBearing` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while the new code fragment is using an empty object literal, which would result in a different object being passed to the `calculateBearing` method.

DONE.
