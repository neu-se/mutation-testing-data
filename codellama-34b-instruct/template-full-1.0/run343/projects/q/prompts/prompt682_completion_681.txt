  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is not a function and will throw an error when called with `apply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is not a function and will throw an error when called with `apply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is not a function and will throw an error when called with `apply`.

DONE.
