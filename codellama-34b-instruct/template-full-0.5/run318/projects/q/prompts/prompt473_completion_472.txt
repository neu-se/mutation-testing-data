  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the index of the reported unhandled rejection, potentially causing the rejection to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the index of the reported unhandled rejection, potentially causing the rejection to be repeated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the index of the reported unhandled rejection to the last element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, potentially causing the rejection to be skipped.

DONE.
