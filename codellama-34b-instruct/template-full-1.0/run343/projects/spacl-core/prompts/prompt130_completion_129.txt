  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1; index < count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `index` would be initialized to `1` instead of `0`, which would cause the loop to start at the second element of the array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = count - 1; index >= 0; index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would be iterated in reverse order, starting from the last element of the array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = Math.ceil(count / 2); index < count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the middle element of the array instead of the first, and would iterate forwards until the end.

DONE.
