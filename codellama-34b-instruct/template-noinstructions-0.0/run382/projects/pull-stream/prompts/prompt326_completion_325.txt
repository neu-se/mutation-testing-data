  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `once` with the `end` argument, while this modified code calls it with both `end` and `data` arguments. This could potentially cause the `onEnd` callback to be called with different arguments than it was designed to handle, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass `null` as the second argument to `once`, while this modified code does. This could potentially cause the `onEnd` callback to be called with a different argument than it was designed to handle, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass `undefined` as the second argument to `once`, while this modified code does. This could potentially cause the `onEnd
