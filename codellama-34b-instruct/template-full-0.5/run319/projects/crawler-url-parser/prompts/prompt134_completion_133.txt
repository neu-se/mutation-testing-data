  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "default" part of the URL, which may be important for the application's functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "default" part of the URL and the following slash, which may be important for the application's functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the "default" part of the URL with the string "default", which may be important for the application's functionality.

DONE.
