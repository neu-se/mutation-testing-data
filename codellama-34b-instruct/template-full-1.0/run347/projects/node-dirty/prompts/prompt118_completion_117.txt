  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is drained, which means that all the data has been written to the stream. In contrast, the `read_close` event is emitted when the read stream is closed, which means that there is no more data to be read from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when there is an error in the read stream, such as if the file cannot be read or if the stream is closed prematurely. In contrast, the `read_close` event is emitted when the read stream is closed normally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'destroy'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` event is emitted when the read stream is destroyed, which means that the stream is no longer usable. In contrast,
