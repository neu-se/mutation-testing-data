  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-val
```
This would result in different behavior because `-val` is the negative of `val`, which would cause the `_data.set(key, val)` method to set the value of the `key` parameter to `-val`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"val"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"val"` is a string, while `val` is a variable. This would cause the `_data.set(key, val)` method to set the value of the `key` parameter to the string `"val"`, rather than the variable `val`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
number
```
This would result in different behavior because `number` is a variable, while `val` is a string. This would cause the `_data.set(key, val)` method to set the value of the `key` parameter to the value of the `number` variable, rather than the string `val`.

Done.
