  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not add an 's' to words ending in 'ics', while the new code fragment would add an 's' to all words ending in 'ics'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'ices') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not replace 'ics' with 'ices', while the new code fragment would replace 'ics' with 'ices' in all words ending in 'ics'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'icses') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not replace 'ics' with 'icses', while the new code
