Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the first string to uppercase, potentially altering the comparison logic in the `diff` function, leading to incorrect diff results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the characters in the first string, which would change the content being compared in the `diff` function, likely resulting in mismatches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1] + "extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends "extra" to the second string, which would affect the diffing process by introducing additional characters that do not exist in the original string, leading to incorrect diff results.

DONE.
