  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `Buffer.isBuffer()` function, causing the code to execute the `content.toString('utf8')` statement even if `content` is not a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isBuffer` property is not a function and will always return `undefined`, causing the code to execute the `content.toString('utf8')` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf16')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method with the `'utf16'` encoding will produce a different string than the `toString()` method with the `'utf8'` encoding, causing the `replace()` method to produce a different result.

DONE.
