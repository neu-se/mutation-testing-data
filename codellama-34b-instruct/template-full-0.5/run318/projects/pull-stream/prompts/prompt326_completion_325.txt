  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `once` with a single argument, while this replacement calls it with two arguments. This could potentially cause the `onEnd` callback to be called twice, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(null, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the `end` argument to `once` as the first argument, while this replacement passes it as the second argument. This could potentially cause the `onEnd` callback to be called with the wrong value, which could also have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not call `once` with any arguments, while this replacement calls it with a single argument. This could potentially cause the `onEnd` callback to be called with the wrong value, which could also have
