  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a function to `cork`, which would be called when the stream is uncorked. However, passing `null` would cause the stream to be corked indefinitely, potentially causing a memory leak.

DONE.
