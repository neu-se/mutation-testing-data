Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate.call(this, op, index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context in which the predicate function is executed, potentially altering the behavior if the predicate relies on `this` being a specific object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the index passed to the predicate, causing it to reference the next index instead of the current one, which could lead to incorrect processing of the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, -index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a negative index to the predicate, which may not be handled correctly by the predicate function, leading to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
