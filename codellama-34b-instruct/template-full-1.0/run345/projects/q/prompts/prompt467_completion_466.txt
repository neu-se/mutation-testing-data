  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit.error` is a different method that takes an error object as its first argument, whereas `process.emit` is a method that takes an event name and a callback function as its arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.on
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.on` is a method that sets an event listener, whereas `process.emit` is a method that emits an event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.removeListener
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.removeListener` is a method that removes an event listener, whereas `process.emit` is a method that emits an event.

DONE.
