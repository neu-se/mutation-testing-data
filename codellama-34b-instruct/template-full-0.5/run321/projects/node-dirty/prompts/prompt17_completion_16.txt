  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because `key++` increments the value of `key` by 1, whereas the original code fragment `key` simply returns the value of `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key--
```
This would result in different behavior because `key--` decrements the value of `key` by 1, whereas the original code fragment `key` simply returns the value of `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `key + 1` returns the value of `key` plus 1, whereas the original code fragment `key` simply returns the value of `key`.

DONE.
