  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a deferred promise that is already resolved, which would cause the resulting promise to be resolved immediately, regardless of whether the `setTimeout` function is called or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a deferred promise that is already rejected, which would cause the resulting promise to be rejected immediately, regardless of whether the `setTimeout` function is called or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a deferred promise that is bound to the current context, which would cause the resulting promise to be resolved or rejected based on the context in which it is called, and not based on the original function's logic.

DONE.
