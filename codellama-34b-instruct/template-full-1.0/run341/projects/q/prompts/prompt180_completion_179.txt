  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(window.Node)"
```
This would result in different behavior because "window.Node" is not a function and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(node.js)(function(){})"
```
This would result in different behavior because "node.js" is not a function and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() {}())"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a syntax error due to the invalid function expression.

DONE.
