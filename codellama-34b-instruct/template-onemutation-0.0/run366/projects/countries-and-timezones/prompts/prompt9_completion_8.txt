  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!countries` checks if the `countries` variable is falsy, while the new code fragment `countries.length === 0` checks if the `countries` array has a length of 0. If the `countries` array is empty, the original code fragment would return `true`, while the new code fragment would return `false`.

DONE.
