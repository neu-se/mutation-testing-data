  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(dispatch)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch` is calling the `dispatch` function on the `Q` promise, whereas `Q(dispatch)` is calling the `dispatch` function on the `Q` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.dispatch` is a property of the `Q` object, whereas `Q(object).dispatch` is a method of the `Q` promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.prototype.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.prototype.dispatch` is a method of the `Q` prototype, whereas `Q(object).dispatch` is a method of the `Q` promise.

DONE.
