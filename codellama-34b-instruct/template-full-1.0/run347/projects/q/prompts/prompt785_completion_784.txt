  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a built-in JavaScript function that throws an error, whereas `rejected` is a function argument passed to the `Q.fail` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise["throw"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `["throw"]` is a JavaScript method that throws an error, whereas `rejected` is a function argument passed to the `Q.fail` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a method that explicitly rejects a promise, whereas `rejected` is a function argument passed to the `Q.fail` method that may or may not reject the promise.

DONE.
