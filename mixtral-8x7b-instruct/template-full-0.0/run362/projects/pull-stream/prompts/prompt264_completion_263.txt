 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the output of the `nextChunk` function would change, as it would now pass `1` instead of `null` as the first argument to the callback of the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the output of the `nextChunk` function would change, as it would now pass a string instead of `null` as the first argument to the callback of the `read` function. This could potentially trigger error handling code in the consumer of this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read
```
This would result in different behavior because the output of the `nextChunk` function would change, as it would now pass the `_read` variable instead of `null` as the first argument to the callback of the `read` function. This could potentially cause unexpected behavior in the consumer of this function, as `_read
