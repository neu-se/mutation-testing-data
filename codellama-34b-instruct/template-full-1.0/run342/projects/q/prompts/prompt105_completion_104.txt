  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the index to the basis, which is not what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] + basis
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the basis to the value at the current index, instead of using the value at the current index as the new basis.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + Math.sqrt(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the square root of the index to the basis, which is not what the original code does.

DONE.
