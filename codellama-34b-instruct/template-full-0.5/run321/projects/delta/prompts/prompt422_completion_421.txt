  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the offset to the index, regardless of whether the offset is greater than the index or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the index, regardless of the offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the index and offset, regardless of whether the offset is greater than the index or not.

DONE.
