  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
're' in a && 'im' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the operands is reversed, so the test would pass if `'re'` is in `a` and `'im'` is not, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
're' in a || 'im' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from `&&` to `||`, so the test would pass if either `'re'` is in `a` or `'im'` is in `a`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
're' in a && 'im' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the second operand is changed from `a` to `b`, so the test would pass if `'re'` is in `a` and `'im'` is in `b`, which is not the intended behavior.
