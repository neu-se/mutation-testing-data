  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER>) => {
  return {
    retain: max(0, elem.retain - 1),

```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the `retain` value of the current op by 1, regardless of the previous op's attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because it would retain the `retain` value of the current op, regardless of the previous op's attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
