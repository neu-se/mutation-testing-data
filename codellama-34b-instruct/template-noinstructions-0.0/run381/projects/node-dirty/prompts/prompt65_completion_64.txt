  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that signals the end of the stream, whereas `destroy()` is a method that destroys the stream. In this case, using `end()` would cause the stream to end prematurely, potentially resulting in data loss or corruption.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` is a method that writes data to the stream, whereas `end()` and `destroy()` are methods that signal the end of the stream. In this case, using `write()` with an empty string would cause the stream to write an empty string, potentially resulting in data corruption or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that signals the end of the stream,
