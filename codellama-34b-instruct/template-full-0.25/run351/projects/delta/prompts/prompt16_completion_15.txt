  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b == null` would check if `b` is null or undefined, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would only check if `b` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `b instanceof Object` would check if `b` is an instance of the `Object` class, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would check if `b` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `b.constructor === Object` would check if `b` is an instance of the `Object` class, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would check if `b` is not an object.

DONE.
