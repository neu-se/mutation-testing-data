  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `chop` method to be called with a length of 0, which would not have any effect on the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `chop` method to be called with a length of 1 less than the original length of the delta, which would remove the last operation from the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `chop` method to be called with a length of 1 greater than the original length of the delta, which would add an extra operation to the delta.

DONE.
