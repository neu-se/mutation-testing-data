  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace carriage returns instead of newlines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n{2,}/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace two or more consecutive newlines instead of a single newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^\n]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace any character that is not a newline instead of a newline.

DONE.
