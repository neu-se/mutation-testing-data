  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of a number, while `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of a number, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.mul
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` is a function that takes a single argument, while `c.mul` is a function that takes two arguments.

DONE.
