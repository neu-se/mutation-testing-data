  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `this.hasNext`, so if `this.hasNext` is `true`, `!this.hasNext` would be `false`, and vice versa. This would cause the `rest()` method to return an empty array instead of the remaining ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.hasNext()` is a method call, and it would return a boolean value indicating whether there are more ops to be processed. If there are no more ops, `this.hasNext()` would return `false`, and the `rest()` method would return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether the current index is less than the length of the `ops` array
