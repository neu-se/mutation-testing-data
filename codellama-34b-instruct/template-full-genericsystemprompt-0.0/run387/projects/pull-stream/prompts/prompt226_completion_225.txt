  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is missing, which would cause the function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) && data.length > 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is added, which would cause the function to only return `true` if `data.length` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) || data.length === 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is added, which would cause the function to return `true` if `data.length` is equal to 0.

DONE.
