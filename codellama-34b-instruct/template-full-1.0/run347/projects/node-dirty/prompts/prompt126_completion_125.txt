  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'write_error'` is an event name that is emitted when an error occurs during a write operation, while `'write_close'` is an event name that is emitted when the write stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'read_error'` is an event name that is emitted when an error occurs during a read operation, while `'write_close'` is an event name that is emitted when the write stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'drain'` is an event name that is emitted when the write stream has drained, while `'write_close'` is an event name that is emitted when the write stream is closed.

DONE.
