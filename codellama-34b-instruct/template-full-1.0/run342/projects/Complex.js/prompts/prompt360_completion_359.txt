  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the variable `a`, rather than the value of the variable `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current object being processed, rather than the value of the variable `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new function that always returns the value of the variable `b`, regardless of the current object being processed.

DONE.
