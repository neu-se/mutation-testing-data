  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled(promises).then(function (states) {
    return states.map(function (state) {
        return state.value;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the values of the settled promises, rather than the promises themselves, which is the behavior of the original code fragment.
