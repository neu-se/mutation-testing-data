  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function(value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is not the same as the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.catch(function(error) {
    throw error;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method returns a new promise that is rejected with the error thrown by the callback function, which is not the same as the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.finally(function() {
    return promise;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is not the same as the original promise.

DONE.
