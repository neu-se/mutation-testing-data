  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.dispatch("delete", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation is not the same as the `dispatch` operation, and it would cause the `del` method to always return a promise for the `delete` operation, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` operation is not the same as the `dispatch` operation, and it would cause the `set` method to always return a promise for the `set` operation, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.dispatch("get", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation is not the same as the `dispatch` operation, and it would cause the `get` method to always return a promise for the `get` operation, regardless of the input.
