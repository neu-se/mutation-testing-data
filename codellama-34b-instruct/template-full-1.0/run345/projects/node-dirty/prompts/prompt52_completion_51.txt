  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `key !== null` is always true, whereas `key` can be null or undefined, depending on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(!key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `(!key)` is always false, whereas `key` can be true or false, depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `key.toString()` will always return a string representation of the key, whereas `key` may be an object or a number.

DONE.
