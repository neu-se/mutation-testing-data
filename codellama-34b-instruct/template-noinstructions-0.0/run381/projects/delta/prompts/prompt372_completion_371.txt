  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an `Op` object returns the length of the operation, but adding 1 to it would cause the operation to have a different length, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an `Op` object returns the length of the operation, but subtracting 1 from it would cause the operation to have a different length, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an `Op` object returns the length of the operation, but multiplying it by 2 would cause the operation to have a different length, which could affect the behavior of the program.

DONE.
