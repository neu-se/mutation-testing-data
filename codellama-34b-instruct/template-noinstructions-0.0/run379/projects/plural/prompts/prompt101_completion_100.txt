  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the letter "a" in the word "man" instead of the letter "o".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/o/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the letter "o" in the word "man" instead of the letter "a".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a|o/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match either the letter "a" or "o" in the word "man", instead of just one of them.

DONE.
