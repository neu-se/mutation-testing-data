  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null` is a different condition than `typeof a !== 'object'`. The original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is null. This change could potentially cause the function to behave differently when `a` is null, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
