Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly returns the filename instead of the line number, which would lead to the function failing to extract the correct line number from the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `0` as the line number, which would misrepresent the actual line number in the stack trace, potentially causing confusion in debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access an index that does not exist in the `attempt3` array, leading to an `undefined` value being returned instead of the expected line number.

DONE.
