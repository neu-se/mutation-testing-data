  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, but the new code fragment checks if it is not an object. This would cause the code to behave differently when `lastOp` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object with an `insert` property, but the new code fragment checks if `lastOp.insert` is not null. This would cause the code to behave differently when `lastOp.insert` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp.insert` is a string, but the new code fragment checks if it is not a string. This would cause the code to behave differently when `last
