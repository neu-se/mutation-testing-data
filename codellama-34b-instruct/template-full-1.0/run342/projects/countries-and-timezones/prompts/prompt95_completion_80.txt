  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `country` object has a `timezones` property, rather than checking if the `country` itself is nullish.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.allTimezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `country` object has an `allTimezones` property, rather than checking if the `country` itself is nullish.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.countries
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `country` object has a `countries` property, rather than checking if the `country` itself is nullish.

DONE.
