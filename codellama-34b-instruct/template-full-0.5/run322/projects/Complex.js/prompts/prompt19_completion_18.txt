  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be a no-op, as `a` is already the value of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the value of `a`, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `b` instead of `a`, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
