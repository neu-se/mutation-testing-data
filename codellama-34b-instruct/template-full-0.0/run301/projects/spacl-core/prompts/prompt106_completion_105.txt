  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.doesNotMatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `doesNotMatch` is a different method than `matches`, and it would cause the `matches` method to return the opposite result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to be called with an additional argument, which could potentially change the result.

DONE.
