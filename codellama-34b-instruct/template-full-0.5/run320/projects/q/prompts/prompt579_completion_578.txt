  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined, "throw");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would return a new function that is bound to the `undefined` context, which would cause the `continuer` function to be called with a `this` value of `undefined` when it is invoked. This would likely cause an error to be thrown, as the `continuer` function is expected to be called with a `this` value that is a reference to the generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would return a new function that is bound to the `null` context, which would cause the `continuer` function to be called with a `this` value of `null` when it is invoked. This would likely cause an error to be thrown, as the `continuer` function is expected to be called with a `this` value that is a reference to the generator
