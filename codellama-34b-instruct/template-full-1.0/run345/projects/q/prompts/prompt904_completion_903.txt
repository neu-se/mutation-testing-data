  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calling `deferred.fail`, which is a method that is used to reject the deferred object with a rejection reason. Replacing it with `deferred.reject` would result in the deferred object being rejected without a rejection reason, which could cause the promise chain to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calling `deferred.fail`, which is a method that is used to reject the deferred object with a rejection reason. Replacing it with `deferred.resolve` would result in the deferred object being resolved without a value, which could cause the promise chain to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calling `deferred
