  This is a fun task! Here are my options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['re'] - z['re']));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` function is missing, which could cause the code to produce invalid results in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
( this['re'] - z['re'] ) ) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the result by 2, which could cause the calculation to be off.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['re'] !== z['re']) return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `this['re']` and `z['re']` values are not the same, the code would return `NaN` instead of `Complex['NAN']` as it does in the original code.

DONE!
