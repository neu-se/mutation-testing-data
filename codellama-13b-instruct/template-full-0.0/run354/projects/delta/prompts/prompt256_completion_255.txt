  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `true` would cause the `isEqual` function to perform a deep comparison of the `insert` properties, which may not be desirable in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `false` would cause the `isEqual` function to perform a shallow comparison of the `insert` properties, which may not be desirable in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `undefined` would cause the `isEqual` function to use the default comparison behavior, which may not be desirable in all cases.

DONE.
