  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (arg === undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof arg === 'number'` check is used to determine if the `arg` parameter is a number, while checking if `arg` is undefined will not provide the same information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (arg < 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof arg === 'number'` check is used to determine if the `arg` parameter is a number, while checking if `arg` is less than zero will not provide the same information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (arg > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof arg === 'number'` check is used to determine if the `arg` parameter is a number, while checking if `arg` is greater than zero will not provide the same information.

DONE.
