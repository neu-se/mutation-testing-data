  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator increments the `end` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `end` is greater than or equal to 1, rather than strictly equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator decrements the `end` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `end` is less than or equal to -1, rather than strictly equal to 0.

DONE.
