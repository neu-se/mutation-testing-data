  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + 1
```
This code fragment adds 1 to the result of the original code fragment, which would cause the `toTile` function to return incorrect tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 - 1
```
This code fragment subtracts 1 from the result of the original code fragment, which would also cause the `toTile` function to return incorrect tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 * 2
```
This code fragment multiplies the result of the original code fragment by 2, which would cause the `toTile` function to return incorrect tile coordinates.

DONE.
