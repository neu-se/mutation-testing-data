  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this code checks if it is `null`. If `op.retain` is an object, it will not be caught by the mutated code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this code checks if it is not `null`. If `op.retain` is an object, it will be caught by the mutated code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this code checks if it is a number. If `op.retain` is an object, it will not be caught by the mutated code
