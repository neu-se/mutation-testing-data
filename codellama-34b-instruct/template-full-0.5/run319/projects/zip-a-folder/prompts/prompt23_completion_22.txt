  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.finalize();
```
This would result in different behavior because `finalize` is a method that is called on the `archiver` object, but it is not the correct method to use in this context. It would cause the `archiver` object to finalize the archive, which would result in an error because the archive has not been created yet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.directory(src, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a directory with the name of the source file, rather than creating an archive with the contents of the source file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.file(src, { name: 'archive.zip' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a file with the name `archive.zip` containing the contents of the source file, rather than creating an archive with the contents of the source file.

DONE.
