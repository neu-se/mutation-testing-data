  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next` is a function that returns the next value in the iteration, whereas `iter.next` is a property that returns the next iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next` is a function that returns the next value in the iteration, whereas `iter.next` is a property that returns the next iterator.
