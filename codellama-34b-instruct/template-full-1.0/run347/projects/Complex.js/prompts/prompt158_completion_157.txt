  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a different method of the `Complex` class and may have a different implementation than `isZero`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks only the real part of the complex number `z` and may not cover all possible cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks only the imaginary part of the complex number `z` and may not cover all possible cases.

DONE.
