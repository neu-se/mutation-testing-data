  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only continues the loop if `end` is truthy, but this replacement continues the loop if `end` is truthy and `test(data)` is truthy, which could cause the loop to continue even if `end` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only continues the loop if `end` is falsy, but this replacement continues the loop if `end` is falsy or `test(data)` is truthy, which could cause the loop to continue even if `end` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? test(data) : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only continues the loop if `end` is truthy, but this replacement continues the loop if `end` is
