  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `__esModule` property to `false`, which could affect the behavior of the `define` function and the way the module is exported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `__esModule` property to `null`, which could affect the behavior of the `define` function and the way the module is exported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `__esModule` property to `undefined`, which could affect the behavior of the `define` function and the way the module is exported.

DONE.
