 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"nonexistentKey"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would not find the "nonexistentKey" property in the resolved object, and therefore not execute the associated function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"values"
