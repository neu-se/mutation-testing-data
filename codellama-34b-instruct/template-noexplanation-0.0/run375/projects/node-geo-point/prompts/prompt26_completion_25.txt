  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This will replace the `deg2rad` function with a random number, which will likely cause the `calculateDestination` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This will replace the `deg2rad` function with the constant value of pi, which will cause the `calculateDestination` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(Math.PI / 2)
```
This will replace the `deg2rad` function with the sine of pi/2, which will cause the `calculateDestination` method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
