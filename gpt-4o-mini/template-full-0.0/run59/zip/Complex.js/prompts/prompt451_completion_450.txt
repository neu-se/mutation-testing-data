Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the subtraction operation to addition, which would yield a different result when comparing the real parts of the complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] - (this['re'] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a constant (1) to the comparison, which would cause the equality check to fail even if the real parts are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] - z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly compares the imaginary part of the current complex number with the imaginary part of the new complex number instead of comparing the real parts, which is not the intended logic.

DONE.
