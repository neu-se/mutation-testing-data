  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      transformedData = AttributeMap.transform(thisData, otherData as AttributeMap);
```
This would result in different behavior because `transformedData` would be assigned the result of `AttributeMap.transform()`, rather than the `otherData` object directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      transformedData = otherData;
```
This would result in different behavior because `transformedData` would be assigned the `otherData` object directly, rather than the result of `AttributeMap.transform()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      transformedData = AttributeMap.transform(otherData as AttributeMap, thisData);
```
This would result in different behavior because `transformedData` would be assigned the result of `AttributeMap.transform(otherData as AttributeMap, thisData)`, which would be a different object from `otherData`.

DONE.
