  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and `a` may have a different value than `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is a different expression than `b`, and the result of the expression may be different than the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(b)` is a different expression than `b`, and the result of the expression may be different than the value of `b`.

DONE.
