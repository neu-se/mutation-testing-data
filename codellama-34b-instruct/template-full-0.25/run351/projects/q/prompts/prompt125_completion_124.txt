  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the property is not defined on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object_hasOwnProperty(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the property is defined on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key in this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the property is not defined on the object.

DONE.
