 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(coordinate.latitude) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the arguments of the `atan` function, which would give incorrect results for the `toTile` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it divides the latitude by 360 instead of 180, which would cause the `y` value in the `toTile` method to be much smaller than expected, leading to incorrect tile calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the longitude instead of the latitude, which would cause the `y` value in the `toTile` method to be incorrect, leading to incorrect tile calculations
