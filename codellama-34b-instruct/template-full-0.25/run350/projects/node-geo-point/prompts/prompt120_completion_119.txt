  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance * 2, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance used in the calculation would be twice the original distance, which would affect the resulting coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing used in the calculation would be 180 degrees different from the original bearing, which would affect the resulting coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing used in the calculation would be reversed from the original bearing, which would affect the resulting coordinate.

DONE.
