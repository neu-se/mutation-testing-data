  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function is called with the `currentUrlStr` argument, which is a string, instead of the `currentUrl` argument, which is an object. This would cause the function to return a different URL object, which could affect the behavior of the `gettype()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function is called with the `currentUrlStr` argument, which is a string, instead of the `currentUrl` argument, which is an object. This would cause the function to return a different URL object, which could affect the behavior of the `gettype()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr, baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function is called with the `current
