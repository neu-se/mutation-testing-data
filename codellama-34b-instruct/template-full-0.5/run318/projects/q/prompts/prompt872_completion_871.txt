  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned a promise that resolves to the result of the `nfapply` method, while the mutated code would throw an error before the method is called, causing the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned a promise that resolves to the result of the `nfapply` method, while the mutated code would return a promise that resolves to `null`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the returned promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Test error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned a promise that resolves to the result of the `nfapply` method, while the mutated code would return a promise that is rejected with an error, which could
