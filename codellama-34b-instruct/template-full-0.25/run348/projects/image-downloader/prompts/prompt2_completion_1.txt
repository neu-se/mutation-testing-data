  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` returns a resolved promise with the given value, whereas `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` returns a promise that resolves when all of the given promises have resolved, whereas `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise with the given reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.race` returns a promise that resolves or rejects when any of the given promises have resolved or rejected, whereas `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise with the given reason.

DONE.
