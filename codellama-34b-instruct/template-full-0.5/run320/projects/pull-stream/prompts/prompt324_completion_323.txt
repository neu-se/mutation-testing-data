  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the identity operator (`===`), which checks for both equality and type, while this new code fragment uses the loose equality operator (`==`), which only checks for equality and would return `null` if `abort` is `false` or `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the identity operator (`===`), which checks for both equality and type, while this new code fragment uses the conditional operator (`?`), which only checks for truthiness and would return `null` if `abort` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the identity operator (`===`), which checks for both equality and type, while this new code fragment uses the negation operator
