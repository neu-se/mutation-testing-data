  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always advance the iterator by one step, even if the current operation is not a retain operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always advance the iterator by two steps, even if the current operation is not a retain operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always advance the iterator by the number of characters in the current operation, even if the current operation is not a retain operation.

DONE.
