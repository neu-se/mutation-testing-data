  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment escapes the characters `.` and `$` using the slash character, which is important for matching path segments that contain these characters. By replacing the escape character with an empty string, the resulting regular expression would not match these characters, causing test failures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '$12')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not add the character `2` to the end of the escaped character, which would result in different matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '$2')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the wrong index for the replacement character. The correct index should be `1`, not `2`, which would result in
