  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would resolve to the value of the `value` variable, while `undefined` would resolve to the primitive value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would resolve to the value of the `value` variable, while `null` would resolve to the primitive value `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"value"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would resolve to the value of the `value` variable, while `"value"` would resolve to the string `"value"`.

DONE.
