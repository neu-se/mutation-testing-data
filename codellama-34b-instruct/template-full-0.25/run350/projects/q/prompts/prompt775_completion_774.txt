  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will immediately reject the promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library and may have additional functionality that is not immediately apparent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` will create a new deferred object, whereas `Q` is a promise library and may have additional functionality that is not immediately apparent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when()` will create a new promise that is resolved when all of the input promises are resolved, whereas `Q` is a promise library and may have additional functionality that is not immediately apparent.

DONE.
