  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not be called with the correct context, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (x) { return x; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (x) { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, causing the program to crash.

DONE.
