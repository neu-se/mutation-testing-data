  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null` or `void 0`, and it would cause the `post` method to always return `value.apply(value, args)`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"undefined"` is not the same as the `undefined` value, and it would cause the `post` method to always return `value.apply(value, args)`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === "null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"null"` is not the same as the `null` value, and it would cause the `post` method to always return `value.apply(value, args)`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
