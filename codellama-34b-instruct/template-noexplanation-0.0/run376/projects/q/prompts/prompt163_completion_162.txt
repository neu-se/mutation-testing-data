  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This will cause the `filterStackString` function to split the stack trace into lines using a tab character instead of a newline character, which may cause the function to produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This will cause the `filterStackString` function to split the stack trace into lines using a space character instead of a newline character, which may cause the function to produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This will cause the `filterStackString` function to split the stack trace into lines using a backslash followed by a "n" character instead of a newline character, which may cause the function to produce unexpected results.

DONE.
