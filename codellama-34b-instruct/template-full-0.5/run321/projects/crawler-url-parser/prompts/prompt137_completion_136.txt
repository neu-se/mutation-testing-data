  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the forward slash, causing the regular expression to match a different pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a space character instead of a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a vertical bar character instead of a forward slash.

DONE.
