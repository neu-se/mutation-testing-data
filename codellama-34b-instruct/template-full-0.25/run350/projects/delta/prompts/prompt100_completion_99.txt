  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'string' && !lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'string'` instead of `'number'`, causing the condition to evaluate to `false` even if `lastOp.retain` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would only be true if `lastOp.attributes` is not null or undefined, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would only be true if `lastOp.attributes` is null, which is the opposite of the original condition.

DONE.
