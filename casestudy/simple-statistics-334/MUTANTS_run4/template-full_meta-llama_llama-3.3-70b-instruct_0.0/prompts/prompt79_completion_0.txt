Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.floor` rounds down, potentially changing the index used in the `quantileSelect` function and affecting the overall quantile calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[l] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `indices[l]` shifts the starting index of the `quantileSelect` function, which could lead to incorrect quantile calculations or out-of-bounds errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
l
```
This would result in different behavior because using `l` directly instead of `Math.floor(indices[l])` could introduce inconsistencies in the indexing, as `l` is not necessarily an index into the `indices` array, potentially causing the `quantileSelect` function to operate on incorrect data.

DONE.
