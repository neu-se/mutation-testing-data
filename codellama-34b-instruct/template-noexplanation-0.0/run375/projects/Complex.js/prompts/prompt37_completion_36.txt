  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b
```
This will cause the function to return the value of the `b` variable, which is the second argument passed to the `logHypot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a + _b
```
This will cause the function to return the sum of the `a` and `b` variables, which is the value of the `a` variable plus the value of the `b` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a * _b
```
This will cause the function to return the product of the `a` and `b` variables, which is the value of the `a` variable multiplied by the value of the `b` variable.

DONE.
