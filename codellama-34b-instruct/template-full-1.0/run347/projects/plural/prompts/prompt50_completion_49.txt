  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]u$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that end with "u" instead of "o".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]y$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that end with "y" instead of "o".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that end with "o" but do not have the "u" character.

DONE.
