  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition, causing the loop to continue even if the write stream is not draining.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `this._waitForDrain` property is equal to 0, which is not the same as checking if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `this._waitForDrain` property is less than 0, which is not the same as checking if it is falsy.

DONE.
