  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the name of the property being looked up on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getKeys"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a new method on the object that is not defined, resulting in a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys_internal"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the name of the property being looked up on the object, and the new property is not defined, resulting in a ReferenceError.

DONE.
