  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because if the input value is a promise, the `Q` function would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () { throw new Error("Oh no!"); })()
```
This would result in different behavior because if the input value is a promise, the `Q` function would throw an error instead of returning a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Promise(function (resolve) { setTimeout(resolve, 1000); });
```
This would result in different behavior because if the input value is a promise, the `Q` function would return a promise that resolves after a 1-second delay instead of returning the input promise.

DONE.
