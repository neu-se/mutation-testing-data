  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would use the latitude value of the first point instead of the latitude value of the second point, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would use the longitude value of the first point instead of the latitude value of the second point, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

DONE.
