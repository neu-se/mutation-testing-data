Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof options === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `options` variable is an object instead of a string, which would lead to incorrect handling of the `options` parameter in the `readFileSync` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `options` variable is not null, which would always be true if `options` is an object or a string, leading to incorrect handling of the `options` parameter in the `readFileSync` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `options` variable is an instance of the String class, which would lead to incorrect handling of the `options` parameter in the `readFileSync` function, as it would not match string literals.

DONE.
