  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is not called, which means that the archive will not be properly finalized and may not be usable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with the `force` option set to `true`, which means that the archive will be finalized even if it is not complete. This could result in a corrupted archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with the `force` option set to `false`, which means that the archive will not be finalized if it is not complete. This could result in a partial archive.

DONE.
