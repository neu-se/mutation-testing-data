  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (true) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate, causing the program to become stuck in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `write` method's `chunk` parameter, and the program would throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function would never execute, causing the program to skip the intended behavior of writing the data to the write stream.

DONE.
