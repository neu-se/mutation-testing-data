  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `replace` method, which would remove any characters after the first semicolon in the `href` attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').split("=").length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `split` method, which would split the `href` attribute into an array of substrings using the `=` character as the delimiter. The length of the array would then be subtracted by 1 to get the number of query parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').match(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `match` method, which would match the `
