  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that writes the file to disk immediately, whereas `writeFile` is an asynchronous function that schedules the write operation to be performed later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` object is empty, so the `writeFileSync` function will not have any options to work with.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is not defined, so the `writeFileSync` function will not have any options to work with.

DONE.
