  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument of the `args` array as the `op` argument, rather than the `op` argument itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument of the `args` array as the `op` argument, rather than the `op` argument itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third argument of the `args` array as the `op` argument, rather than the `op` argument itself.

DONE.
