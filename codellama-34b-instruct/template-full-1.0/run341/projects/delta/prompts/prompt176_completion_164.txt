  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisIter.peekLength()` method would not be called, and the `length` variable would be used directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peekLength()` method would not be called, and the `length` variable would be used directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `length` would not be defined, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
