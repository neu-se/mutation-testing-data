  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator would increment the value of `key` by 1, which could potentially change the order of the keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `key`, which could potentially change the order of the keys in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `key` by 2, which could potentially change the order of the keys in the object.

DONE.
