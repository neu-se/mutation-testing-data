  Sure, I can provide three options for a buggy code fragment that can replace the PLACEHOLDER in the given code snippet. Here are my suggestions:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not a valid key for the `Map` object, and attempting to delete it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, which is unlikely to be a valid key for the `Map` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.lastKey()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.lastKey()` returns the last key of the `Map` object, which may not be the same as the `key` argument passed to the `rm` method.

DONE.
