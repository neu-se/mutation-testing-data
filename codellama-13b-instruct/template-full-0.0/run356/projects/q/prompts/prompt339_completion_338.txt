  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race(answerPs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a for loop to iterate over the `answerPs` array, while this code uses the `Q.race` function to race all the promises in the array. This could result in different behavior if the `Q.race` function has different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(answerPs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a for loop to iterate over the `answerPs` array, while this code uses the `Q.all` function to wait for all the promises in the array to settle. This could result in different behavior if the `Q.all` function has different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spread(answerPs, function (x, y) {
    return x === y ? x : Q.reject(new
