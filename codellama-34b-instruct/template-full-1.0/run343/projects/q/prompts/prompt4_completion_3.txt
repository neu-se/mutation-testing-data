  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pizza"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the string "pizza" instead of the function definition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return an empty function instead of the function definition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { return function() { return "pizza"; }; })()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a function that returns the string "pizza".

DONE.
