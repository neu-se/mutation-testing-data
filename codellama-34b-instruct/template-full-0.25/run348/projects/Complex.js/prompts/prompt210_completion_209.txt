  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` refers to the real part of the complex number, while `b` refers to the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` refers to the real part of the complex number, while `a + b` refers to the sum of the real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` refers to the real part of the complex number, while `a * b` refers to the product of the real and imaginary parts.

DONE.
