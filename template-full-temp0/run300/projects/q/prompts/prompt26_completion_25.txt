  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task()
```
This would result in different behavior because `task` is a function and `task()` would call the function, whereas `task` by itself would just refer to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `task` is a function and `task + 1` would perform addition on the function, whereas `task` by itself would just refer to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `task.call()` would call the function with a different context, whereas `task` by itself would call the function with the same context.

DONE.
