  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `z` is a `Complex` object, and `isInfinite()` is not a method of the `Complex` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because `z` is a `Complex` object, and `isInfinite()` is not a method of the `Complex` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `z` is a `Complex` object, and `isZero()` is not a method of the `Complex` class.

DONE.
