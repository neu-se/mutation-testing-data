  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not remove the correct element from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` removes the first element from the `unhandledRejections` array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not remove the correct element from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element from the `unhandledRejections` array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not remove the correct element from the array.

DONE.
