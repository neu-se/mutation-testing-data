  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` would return `'string'` if `thisOp.retain` is a string, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `thisOp.retain` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` would be `null` if the `if` statement evaluates to `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `thisOp.retain` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` would not be `null` if the `if` statement evaluates to `true`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`
