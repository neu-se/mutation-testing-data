  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' ||
        (typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null) ||
        (typeof op.retain === 'string' && op.retain.length > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the value of `op.retain` is a non-empty string, which is not checked in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' ||
        (typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null) ||
        (typeof op.retain === 'function')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the value of `op.retain` is a function, which is not checked in the original code fragment.
