  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { xmlMode: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `xmlMode` option would cause Cheerio to parse the HTML as XML, which could result in different parsing behavior for certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { decodeEntities: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `decodeEntities` option would cause Cheerio to not decode HTML entities, which could result in different parsing behavior for certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { lowerCaseTags: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lowerCaseTags` option would cause Cheerio to lowercase all tag names, which could result in different parsing behavior for certain edge cases.

DONE.
