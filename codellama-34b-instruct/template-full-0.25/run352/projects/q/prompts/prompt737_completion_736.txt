  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the `promises` array is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the `promises` array is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the `promises` array has exactly one element.

DONE.
