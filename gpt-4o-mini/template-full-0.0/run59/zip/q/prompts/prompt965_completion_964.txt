Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.call
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method from `apply`, which passes an array of arguments, to `call`, which expects individual arguments, potentially leading to incorrect argument handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `bind`, which creates a new function with a specific `this` context, rather than invoking `Q.nbind` directly, which could lead to unexpected results when the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind(0, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes `0` as the first argument instead of the intended `void 0`, which could lead to an incorrect context being used when the function is executed.

DONE.
