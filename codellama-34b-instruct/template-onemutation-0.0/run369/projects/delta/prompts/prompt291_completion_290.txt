  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index =
    typeof thisOp.insert === 'string'
        ? thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, start) - start
        : -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `indexOf` method to find the index of the newline character in the `insert` property of the `thisOp` object, while the new code fragment uses the `lastIndexOf` method, which would find the index of the last occurrence of the newline character instead.
