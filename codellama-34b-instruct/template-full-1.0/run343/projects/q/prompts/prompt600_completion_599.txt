  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` returns a new array, while `args` is the original array. This could cause unexpected behavior in the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0]` is the first element of the `args` array, while `args` is the entire array. This could cause unexpected behavior in the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a fixed value, while `args` is an array that could contain a variety of values. This could cause unexpected behavior in the `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
