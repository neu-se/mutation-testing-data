  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a different value for the `im` property of the `z` object, which will in turn affect the behavior of the `Complex` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a different value for the `im` property of the `z` object, which will in turn affect the behavior of the `Complex` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a different value for the `im` property of the `z` object, which will in turn affect the behavior of the `Complex` constructor.

DONE.
