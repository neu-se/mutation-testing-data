  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`, and it may not handle errors in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is a different function than `fs.readFile`, and it may not handle errors in the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a different function than `fs.readFile`, and it may not handle errors in the same way.

DONE.
