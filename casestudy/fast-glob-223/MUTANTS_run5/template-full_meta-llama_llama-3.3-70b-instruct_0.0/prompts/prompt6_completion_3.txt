Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern, { strict: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `strict` option from `false` to `true`, which could affect how the `isGlob` function handles certain patterns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.toUpperCase(), { strict: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `pattern` to uppercase before passing it to `isGlob`, which could lead to incorrect results if the function is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.replace(GLOBSTAR, ''), { strict: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes all occurrences of the `GLOBSTAR` symbol from the `pattern` before passing it to `isGlob`, which could affect how the function handles glob patterns.

DONE.
