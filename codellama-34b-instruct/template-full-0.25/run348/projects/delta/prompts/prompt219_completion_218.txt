  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality between the two ops arrays, while this replacement checks for inequality. This would cause the `diff()` method to return a non-empty delta even if the two ops arrays are equal, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length !== other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality between the lengths of the two ops arrays, while this replacement checks for inequality. This would cause the `diff()` method to return a non-empty delta even if the two ops arrays have the same length, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length > other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality between the lengths of the two
