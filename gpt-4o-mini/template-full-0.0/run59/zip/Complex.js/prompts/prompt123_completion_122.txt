Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true when `z` is not infinite, leading to the addition of two complex numbers being treated as valid even when one of them is infinite, which is not the intended logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `z` is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, which would incorrectly allow the addition of an infinite complex number with a zero complex number, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if both `this` and `z` are infinite, ignoring the case where only one of them is infinite, which would lead to incorrect handling of infinite values in the addition operation.

DONE.
