  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == undefined || a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` is the abstract equality comparison operator, which would perform type coercion and return `true` if `a` is either `undefined` or `null`, while `a === undefined || a === null` would use the strict equality operator and only return `true` if `a` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != undefined || a != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!=` is the abstract inequality comparison operator, which would perform type coercion and return `true` if `a` is either `undefined` or `null`, while `a !== undefined || a !== null` would use the strict inequality operator and only return `true` if `a` is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && b
```
This would result in different behavior because `&&` is the logical AND operator, which would only return
