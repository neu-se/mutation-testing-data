  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regex match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/i, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which makes the regex case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/m, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag is added, which makes the regex match across multiple lines.

DONE.
