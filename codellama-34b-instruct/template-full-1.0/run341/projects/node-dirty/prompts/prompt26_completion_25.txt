  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb(null);`, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with `undefined` as the payload, whereas the new code fragment would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with `null` as the payload.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb("drain");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb(null);`, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with `null` as the payload, whereas the new code fragment would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with `"drain"` as the payload.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb(null);`, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with `null` as the payload, whereas
