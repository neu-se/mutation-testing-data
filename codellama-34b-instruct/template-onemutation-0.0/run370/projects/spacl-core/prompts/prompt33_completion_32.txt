  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `for...of` loop to iterate over the array returned by `spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()`, while the new code fragment is using the index operator to access the first element of the array directly. This change would cause the loop to only execute once, and the `part` variable would be assigned the value of the first element of the array, rather than the value of the current element being iterated over.
