  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which would not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(deferred, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to be called with `null` as the second argument, which would not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(deferred, deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to be called with the same `deferred` object as both arguments, which would not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
