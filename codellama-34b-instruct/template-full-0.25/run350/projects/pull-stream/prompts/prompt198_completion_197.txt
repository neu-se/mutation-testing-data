  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes two arguments, while `cb` is a function that takes one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb()` is a function call that returns a value, while `cb` is a function that does not return a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb(aborted)` is a function call that passes the `aborted` argument to the `abortCb` function, while `cb` is a function that does not take any arguments.

DONE.
