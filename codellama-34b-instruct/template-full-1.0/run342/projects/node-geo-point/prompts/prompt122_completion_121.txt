  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the current object, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the current object, while `undefined` is a value that represents an undefined or uninitialized object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the current object, while `0` is a number value.

DONE.
