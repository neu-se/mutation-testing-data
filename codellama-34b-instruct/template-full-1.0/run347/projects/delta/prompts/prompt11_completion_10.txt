  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key: string in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the type of `key` is specified as `string`, which may cause errors if the actual value of `key` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in b
```
This would result in different behavior because `key` is being checked in the `b` object instead of `a`, which may cause issues if the key is not present in `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key: unknown in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the type of `key` is specified as `unknown`, which may cause errors if the actual value of `key` is not compatible with the expected type.

DONE.
