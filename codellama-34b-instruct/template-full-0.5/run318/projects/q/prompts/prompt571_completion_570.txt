  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behavior when it comes to the `this` binding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to a specific `this` context, whereas `apply` and `call` do not change the `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` with a `null` context will set the `this` context to the global object, whereas `call` and `bind` do not change the `this` context.

DONE.
