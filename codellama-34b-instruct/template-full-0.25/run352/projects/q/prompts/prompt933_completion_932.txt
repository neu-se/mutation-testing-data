  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `args` array, which is the callback function that is expected to be passed as the last argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra `null` argument to the end of the `args` array, which would cause the callback function to be called with an incorrect number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the arguments in the `args` array, which would cause the callback function to be called with the arguments in the wrong order.

DONE.
