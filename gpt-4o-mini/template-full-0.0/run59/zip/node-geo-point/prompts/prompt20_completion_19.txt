Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the `isObject` check to fail, leading to a `TypeError` being thrown, whereas the original code expects a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, which would also cause the `isObject` check to fail, resulting in a `TypeError`, unlike the original code which expects a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is considered an object in JavaScript, and it would pass the `isObject` check, but it would fail the subsequent checks for the properties `latitude` and `longitude`, leading to a `TypeError`, unlike the original code which expects a valid object with those properties.

DONE.
