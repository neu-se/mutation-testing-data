  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logHypot
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function is not defined in the code, and therefore would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(Math.hypot(a, b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.hypot` function is not defined in the code, and therefore would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt` function is not defined in the code, and therefore would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
