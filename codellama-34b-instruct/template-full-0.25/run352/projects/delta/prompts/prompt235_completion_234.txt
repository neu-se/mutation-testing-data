  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a smaller length, which could cause the iteration to skip over some operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a larger length, which could cause the iteration to include additional operations that were not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a larger length, which could cause the iteration to include additional operations that were not intended.

DONE.
