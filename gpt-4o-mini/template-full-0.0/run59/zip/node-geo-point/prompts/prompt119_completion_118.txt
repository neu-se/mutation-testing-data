Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 180 degrees to the bearing, effectively reversing the direction of the destination point, which could lead to incorrect calculations of the destination.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the bearing value, which would result in a completely different direction for the destination point, potentially leading to an incorrect location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 90 degrees from the bearing, which would change the direction of the destination point by 90 degrees, resulting in a point that is 90 degrees to the left of the intended destination.

DONE.
