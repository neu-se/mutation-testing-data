  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args[0], args[1], args[2]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args[1], args[0], args[2]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args[0], args[1], args[3]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments than the original code.

DONE.
