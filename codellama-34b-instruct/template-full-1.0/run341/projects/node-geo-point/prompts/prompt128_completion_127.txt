  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this, point)
```
This would result in different behavior because `calculateDistance()` takes two `GeoPoint` arguments, while `this, point` would pass a `GeoPoint` and a `LatLng` object to the method, causing a type mismatch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.calculateDistance(point)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `calculateDistance()` method on the `this` object, instead of the `GeoPoint.calculateDistance()` method, which could lead to different results if the method is implemented differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this, point))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs()` would return the absolute value of the distance, which could be different from the original calculation that may have involved negative distances.

DONE.
