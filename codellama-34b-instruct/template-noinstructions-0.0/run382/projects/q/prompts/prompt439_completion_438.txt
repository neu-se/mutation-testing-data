  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("test"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject("test"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the string "test", whereas the original code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("test")); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error object, whereas the original code would not.

DONE.
