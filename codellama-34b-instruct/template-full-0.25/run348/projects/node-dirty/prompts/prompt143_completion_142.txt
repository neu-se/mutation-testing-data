  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Buggy error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different from the original error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the error object is null, which would cause the callback function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is the same as the original error message, but the error object is different.

DONE.
