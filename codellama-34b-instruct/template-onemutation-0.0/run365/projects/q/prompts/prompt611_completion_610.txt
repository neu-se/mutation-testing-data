  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is used to retrieve the value of a property, while the `set` method is used to set the value of a property. Using `set` instead of `get` would cause the `dispatch` method to set the value of the property instead of retrieving it, which would likely cause unexpected behavior in the program.
