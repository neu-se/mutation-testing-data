  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0 && this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `Complex['ONE']`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0 || this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `Complex['ONE']` if either `z['re']` or `this['re']` is zero, instead of only when both are zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] & this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `Complex['ONE']` if either `z['re']` or `this['re']` is zero, and only if both are zero.

DONE.
