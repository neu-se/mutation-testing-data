  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * sinδ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of `φ1` instead of `φ2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cosδ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of `φ1` instead of `φ2`, and the cosine of `δ` instead of `sinδ`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * sinδ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of `φ1` instead of `φ2`, and the sine of `δ` instead of `sinδ`.

DONE.
