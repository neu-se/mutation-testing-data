  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string with the word "criteria" in the plural form, while the new code fragment is a string with the word "criterion" in the singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string with the word "criteria" in the plural form, while the new code fragment is a string with the word "criterions" in the plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string with the word "criteria" in the plural form, while the new code fragment is a string with the word "criterion" in the singular form followed by the letter "s" to make it plural.

DONE.
