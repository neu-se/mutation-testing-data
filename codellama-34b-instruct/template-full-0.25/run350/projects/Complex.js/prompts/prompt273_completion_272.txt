  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `arg` function to return the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `arg` function to return the real part of the complex number plus 1 instead of the real part, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `arg` function to return the constant pi instead of the real part of the complex number, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
