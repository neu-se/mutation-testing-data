  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be set to medium instead of uncompressed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be set to high instead of uncompressed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be set to uncompressed instead of medium or high.

DONE.
