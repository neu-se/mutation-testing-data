  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `nodeback` with a single argument, while this modified code fragment calls it with two arguments. This could cause the callback function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(null, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `nodeback` with a single argument, while this modified code fragment calls it with two arguments, but in a different order. This could cause the callback function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `nodeback` with a single argument, while this modified code fragment calls it with no arguments. This could cause the callback function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
