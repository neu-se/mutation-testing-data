  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the error to the console, regardless of whether it has been handled or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof process.emit === "function") {
    process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only log the error to the console if the `emit` function is defined, which would not necessarily indicate that the error has not been handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof process.emit.name === "undefined") {
    process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only log the error to the console if the `emit` function has a `name` property, which would not necessarily indicate that the error has not been handled.
