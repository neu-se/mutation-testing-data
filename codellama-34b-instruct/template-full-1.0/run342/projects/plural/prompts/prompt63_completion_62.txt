  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word would not be a valid plural form of the word "bacterium".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'("bacterium", "bacteria")'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function being called would be a different one, and the output would not be the same as the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium.join("")'
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting string would be different from the original, and the plural form of the word would not be returned.

DONE.
