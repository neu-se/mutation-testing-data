Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, this.get(key) + 1, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value retrieved from the database by adding 1 to it, which may not be the intended update behavior defined by the `updater` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to `null` regardless of the current value, effectively removing the key from the database without applying any update logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, this._data.get(key), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the current value directly from the `_data` map instead of applying the `updater` function, which could lead to incorrect or unintended updates.

DONE.
