  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to decrease by `length`, which would cause the `slice` method to return a different range of elements from the `base` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to return a range of elements that includes the next element after `baseIndex + length`, which would cause the `forEach` loop to iterate over a different set of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to return a range of elements that excludes the last element before `baseIndex + length`, which would cause the `forEach` loop to iterate over a different set of elements.

DONE.
