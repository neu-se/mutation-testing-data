  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `end.tail` to `end`, creating a circular reference, while this code sets it to `null`, breaking the circular reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = Q.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `end.tail` to `end`, creating a circular reference, while this code sets it to a rejected promise, which would cause the `get` method to fail with the specified error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = Q.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `end.tail` to `end`, creating a circular reference, while this code sets it to a resolved promise, which would cause the `get` method to return the specified error instead of failing.

DONE.
