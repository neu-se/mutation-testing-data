  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 ðŸ˜€
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the smiley face would change the output of the `alert` statement to include a smiley face.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `+ 1` would alter the output of the `alert` statement to show the result of the addition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the division by zero would cause an error to be thrown and the `alert` statement would not be executed.

DONE.
