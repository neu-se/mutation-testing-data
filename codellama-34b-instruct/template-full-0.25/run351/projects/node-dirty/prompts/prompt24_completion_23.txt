  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, which is a function. If `cb` is not null or undefined, the negation would result in a falsy value, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to false, even if `cb` is a function that should be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a short-circuit operator, which means that if the first operand is falsy, the second operand is not evaluated. In this case, if `cb` is not null or undefined, the second operand `false` would not be evaluated, and the `if` statement would evaluate to true, even if `cb` is a function that should not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
