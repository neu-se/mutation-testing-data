  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `key` variable, while the buggy code fragment is using the `key` property of the `object` variable. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `object` variable has a `key` property that is different from the `key` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `key` variable, while the buggy code fragment is using the `key` property of the `object` variable.
