  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `get` operation instead of the `post` operation, which would cause the method to return a promise for the property value instead of the return value of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `set` operation instead of the `post` operation, which would cause the method to return a promise for the property value instead of the return value of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `delete` operation instead of the `post` operation, which would cause the method to return a promise for the property value instead of the return value of the method.

DONE.
