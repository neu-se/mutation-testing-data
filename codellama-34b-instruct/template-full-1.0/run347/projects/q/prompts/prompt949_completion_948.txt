  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects an object to be passed as the first argument, whereas `apply` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because an arrow function with no arguments would be created, whereas the original code expects the function to accept arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {
    // empty function
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be a no-op, whereas the original code expects the function to have some behavior.

DONE.
