  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the buggy code fragment is a variable reference. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variable is not defined or has a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the buggy code fragment is a property reference. This could cause the code to behave differently if the property is not defined or has a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"toString"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the buggy code fragment is a method reference. This could cause the code to behave differently if the method is not defined or has a different implementation.

DONE.
