  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the specified number of characters from the `inverted` delta, whereas `retain` is a method that retains the specified number of characters from the `inverted` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(length, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the specified number of characters from the `inverted` delta, but with an empty attributes object, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(length, { [embedType]: handler.invert(opData, baseOpData) })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the specified number of characters from the `inverted` delta, but with an attributes object that is the result of inverting the attributes of the
