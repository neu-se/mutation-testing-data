  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` parameter is not being passed to the `abort` function, which may cause issues if the `abort` function is being used to handle errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` parameter is being replaced with an empty function, which may cause issues if the `abort` function is being used to handle errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, function (err) { throw err; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` parameter is being replaced with a function that throws an error, which may cause issues if the `abort` function is being used to handle errors.

DONE.
