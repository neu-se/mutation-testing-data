  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This change will cause the `atan2` function to use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which will result in a different angle and a different result for the `pow` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['re'] + 1
```
This change will cause the `atan2` function to use a different angle, which will result in a different result for the `pow` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im'] + 1
```
This change will cause the `atan2` function to use a different angle, which will result in a different result for the `pow` function.

DONE.
