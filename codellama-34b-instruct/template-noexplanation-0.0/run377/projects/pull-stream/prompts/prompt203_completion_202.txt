  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is not defined or is `null`. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the code, such as infinite loops or incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end.length > 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to only evaluate to `true` if `end` is a non-empty array. This can help to prevent errors caused by `end` being `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== null && end !== undefined
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to only evaluate to `true` if `end` is not `null` or `undefined`. This can help to prevent errors caused by `end` being `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
