  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with a different operation name, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with a different operation name, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with a different operation name, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

DONE.
