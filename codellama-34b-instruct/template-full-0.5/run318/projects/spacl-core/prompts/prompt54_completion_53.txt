  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.pop` would remove the last element from the `parts` array, rather than adding a new element to it as `parts.push` would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.unshift` would add a new element to the beginning of the `parts` array, rather than the end as `parts.push` would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.splice(0, 0, <code fragment>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.splice` would add a new element to the beginning of the `parts` array, rather than the end as `parts.push` would. Additionally, the `0` and `0` arguments to `splice` would cause the new element to be inserted at the beginning of the array, rather than at the end.

DONE
