  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. In particular, `sinh(x)` is equal to `cosh(x)` only when `x` is equal to `0`. Therefore, replacing `cosh` with `sinh` would result in different behavior for non-zero values of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. In particular, `tanh(x)` is equal to `cosh(x)` only when `x` is equal to `0`. Therefore, replacing `cosh` with `tanh` would result in different behavior for non-zero values of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coth
```
This would result in different behavior because `coth` and `cos
