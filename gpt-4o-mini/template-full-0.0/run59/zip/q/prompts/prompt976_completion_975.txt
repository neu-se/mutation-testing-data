Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args && args.length ? args : [null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return an array containing `null` if `args` is empty or undefined, instead of returning an empty array, which could lead to unexpected behavior when the function is called without arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length > 0 ? args : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `undefined` if `args` is empty, which could cause issues in the subsequent code that expects an array, potentially leading to runtime errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always append the number `1` to the `args` array, regardless of its original content, which could alter the expected arguments passed to the method being invoked.

DONE.
