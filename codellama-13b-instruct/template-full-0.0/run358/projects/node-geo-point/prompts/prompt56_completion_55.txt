  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function returns the sine of its argument, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of its argument. The `sin` function is used in the calculation of the latitude and longitude of the destination point, while the `cos` function is used in the calculation of the bearing between two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)` expression calculates the y-coordinate of the destination point, whereas the `cos` function calculates the cosine of its argument. The `cos` function is used in the calculation of the bearing between two points, while the `sin` function is used in the calculation of the latitude and longitude of the destination point.
