  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine, but the suggested replacement calculates the negative cosine. The resulting complex number would have the opposite real part and opposite imaginary part of the original complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine, but the suggested replacement calculates the reciprocal of the argument. The resulting complex number would have the reciprocal of the original complex number's real part and reciprocal of the original complex number's imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a^2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine, but the suggested replacement calculates the square of the argument. The resulting complex number would have the square of the original complex number's real part and square of the original complex number's imaginary part.
