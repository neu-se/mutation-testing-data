  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to always return `a`, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to always return `b + 1`, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to always return `a + b`, regardless of the value of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
