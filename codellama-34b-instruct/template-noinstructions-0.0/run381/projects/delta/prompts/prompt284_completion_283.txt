  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the lines of the delta, rather than the characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the characters of the delta, rather than the lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the words of the delta, rather than the lines or characters.

DONE.
