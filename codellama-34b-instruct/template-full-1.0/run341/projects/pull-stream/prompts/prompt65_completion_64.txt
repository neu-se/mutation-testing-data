  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` function instead of returning it, which could cause the callback to be called more than once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to the `done` function, which could cause the callback to be called with an unexpected argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `true` as the first argument to the `done` function, which could cause the callback to be called with an unexpected argument.

DONE.
