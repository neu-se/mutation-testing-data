  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not equal to `0` and would cause the `diff` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not equal to `0` and would cause the `diff` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is not equal to `0` and would cause the `diff` function to behave differently.

DONE.
