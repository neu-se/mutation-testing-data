  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `var key` would assign the value `undefined` to `key`, which would cause the loop to infinitely push `"undefined"` onto the `keys` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `var key` would assign the value `null` to `key`, which would cause the loop to infinitely push `"null"` onto the `keys` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = object[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because `var key` would assign the value of the current object property `i` to `key`, which would cause the loop to incorrectly push the property value onto the `keys` array.

DONE.
