  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.next()` method would be called with a smaller argument, which would cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.next()` method would be called with a larger argument, which would cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.next()` method would be called with a larger argument, which would cause the iterator to return a different value.

DONE.
