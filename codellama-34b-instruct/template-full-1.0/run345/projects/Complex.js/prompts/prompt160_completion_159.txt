  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if the complex number is zero, while `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite. If the complex number is zero, the code would return `Complex.NAN` instead of `Complex.INFINITY`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] -= Complex.ONE
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract one from the real part of the complex number, which could change the sign of the number. If the complex number was positive, it would become negative, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] = Complex.ZERO
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the imaginary part of the complex number to zero, which could change the value of the number. If the complex number had a non-zero imaginary part, the result would be different.
