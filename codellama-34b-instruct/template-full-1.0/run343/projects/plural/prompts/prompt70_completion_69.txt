  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'ceills')
```
This would result in different behavior because the word 'cello' is now being treated as if it follows a different rule than the word 'cellos', even though they are the same word and should have the same plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cellos')
```
This would result in similar behavior to the original code, but the word 'cello' would now be recognized as a word that does not follow any of the existing rules and would default to using the default rule of adding 's'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', function(w) { return w; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the word 'cello' is now being treated as if it follows a different rule than the word 'cellos', where the rule is to return the original word without making any changes.

DONE.
