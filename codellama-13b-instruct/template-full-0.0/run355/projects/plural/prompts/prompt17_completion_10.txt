  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `|` operator to match either `x`, `ch`, or `s` at the end of a word, while the new code fragment uses the `addRule` function to add a new rule for words that end with `x`, `ch`, or `s`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `|` operator to match either `x`, `ch`, or `s` at the end of a word, while the new code fragment uses the `addRule` function to add a new rule for words that end with `x`, `ch`, or `s`.
