 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the inspection would only consider promises that are already fulfilled, and not take into account promises that are still pending or have been rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inspected.value.state === "fulfilled"
