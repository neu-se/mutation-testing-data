 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...urlMap.values()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread operator (`...`) creates a new array, while `Array.from` creates a new array-like object. In some cases, this could lead to different behavior in the code that processes the `retArr` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.values().toArray()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toArray` is a method specific to TypeScript's `Iterable` interface, which is not part of the standard JavaScript language. This could lead to compatibility issues or unexpected behavior in different environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.values().slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a new array-like object, but it does not create a deep copy of the objects within the array. If any of the objects in the `urlMap` are mutated after
