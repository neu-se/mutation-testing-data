  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`${Math.random()}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple identifier, but the new code fragment is a method call that returns a random number. This change would introduce randomness into the code, which could potentially cause differences in behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`${id * 2}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple identifier, but the new code fragment is an arithmetic expression that multiplies the identifier by 2. This change would introduce a disturbance in the expected behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`undefined`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple identifier, but the new code fragment is an undefined value. This change would introduce a type error in the code, which could potentially cause differences in behavior.

DONE.
