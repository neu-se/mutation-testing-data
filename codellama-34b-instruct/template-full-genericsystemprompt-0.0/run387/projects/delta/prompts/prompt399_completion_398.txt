  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `thisData` and `otherData` are not equal, regardless of their types or contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== null && otherData !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if both `thisData` and `otherData` are not `null`, regardless of their types or contents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== null && otherData !== null && typeof thisData === 'object' && typeof otherData === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if both `thisData` and `otherData` are not `null` and are objects, regardless of their contents.

DONE.
