  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array, while `nodeArgs` is an array of arguments that should be passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, while `nodeArgs` should be passed as is to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array, while `nodeArgs` should be passed as is to the function.

DONE.
