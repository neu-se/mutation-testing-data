  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method on `self` with the `error` argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the `error` reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resolve` method on `self` with the `error` argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the `error` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `notify` method on `self` with the `error` argument, which would cause the promise to be notified with the `error` value.

DONE.
