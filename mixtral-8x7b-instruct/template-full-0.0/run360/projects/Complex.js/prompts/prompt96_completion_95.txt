 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN()` function would return true, causing the function to exit prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would treat any input with a non-zero imaginary part as zero, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function expects an object with specific properties, and returning `null` would cause the function to exit prematurely.

DONE.
