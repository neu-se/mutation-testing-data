  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sinh()` function returns the hyperbolic sine of a number, while the original code fragment uses the `sinh()` function, which is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cosh()` function returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, while the original code fragment uses the `cosh()` function, which is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.tanh()` function returns the hyperbolic tangent of a number, while the original code fragment uses the `tanh()` function, which is not defined.

DONE.
