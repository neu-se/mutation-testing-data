  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the write permission check would be skipped, allowing the code to write to the target folder even if it doesn't have the necessary permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the read permission check would be skipped, allowing the code to read from the target folder even if it doesn't have the necessary permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for both read and write permissions, but the `fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK` expression would always evaluate to `true`, allowing the code to write to the target folder even if it doesn't have the
