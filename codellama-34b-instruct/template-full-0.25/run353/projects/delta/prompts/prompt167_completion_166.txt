  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(length));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the other iterator onto the delta, rather than the current operation from the this iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next(length));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the this iterator onto the delta, rather than the current operation from the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(length));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the other iterator onto the delta, rather than the current operation from the this iterator.

DONE.
