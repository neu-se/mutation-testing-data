  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the current index is less than or equal to the length of the array, whereas this replacement checks only if it is less than the length minus one, which would result in the last element of the array being skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the current index is less than the length of the array, whereas this replacement checks only if it is equal to the length minus one, which would result in the last element of the array being included.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the current index is less than the length of the array, whereas this replacement checks only if it is greater than or equal to the length minus one, which would result in the last element of
