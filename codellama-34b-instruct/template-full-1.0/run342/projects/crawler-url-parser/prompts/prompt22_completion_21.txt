  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol-relative URL with an HTTP scheme, while this replacement would just hardcode the domain name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\/example.com$/, 'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any protocol-relative URL, while this replacement only matches URL's with the domain name 'example.com'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!\/\/example.com).*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment converts any protocol-relative URL to HTTP scheme, while this replacement just removes any URL's that do not contain 'example.com'.
