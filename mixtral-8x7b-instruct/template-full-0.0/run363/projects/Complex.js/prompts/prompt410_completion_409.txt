 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the `if` block, changing the sign of `x['im']` only when `a` is not equal to -1, instead of when `noIM` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d > 0
