  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `\n` as the line separator, while `\r\n` is a different line separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `\n` as the line separator, while `\r` is a different line separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `\n` as the line separator, while `\t` is a different line separator.

DONE.
