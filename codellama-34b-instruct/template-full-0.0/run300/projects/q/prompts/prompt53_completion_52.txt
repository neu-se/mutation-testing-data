  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" &&
        process.toString() === "[object process]" && process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process` object is not defined in the browser, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" &&
        process.toString() === "[object process]" && process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process` object is not defined in the browser, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.
