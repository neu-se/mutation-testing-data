  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { decodeEntities: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `decodeEntities` option is set to `false`, which means that HTML entities in the input data will not be decoded. This could cause the `cheerio` library to produce different results when parsing the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { normalizeWhitespace: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `normalizeWhitespace` option is set to `true`, which means that the library will normalize whitespace in the input data before parsing it. This could cause the `cheerio` library to produce different results when parsing the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { xmlMode: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `xmlMode` option is set to `true`, which means that the library
