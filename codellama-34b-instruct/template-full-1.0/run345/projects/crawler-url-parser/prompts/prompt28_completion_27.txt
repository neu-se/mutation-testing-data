  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added to ensure a case-insensitive comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\W+:/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\w+` pattern is replaced with `\W+`, which matches any non-word character instead of any word character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `//` pattern is added to ensure that the string starts with a forward slash.

DONE.
