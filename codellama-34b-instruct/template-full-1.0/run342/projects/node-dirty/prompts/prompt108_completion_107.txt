This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if there is a corrupted row at the end of the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if there is a corrupted row at the end of the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if there is a corrupted row at the end of the database.

DONE.
