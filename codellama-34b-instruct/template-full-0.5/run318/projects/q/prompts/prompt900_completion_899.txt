  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver` directly, which creates a new function that is bound to `deferred`, whereas this modified code uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)` which creates a new function that is bound to `deferred` and then immediately discards it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){return deferred.makeNodeResolver;})()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver` directly, which creates a new function that is bound to `deferred`, whereas this modified code uses a self-executing function that returns `deferred.makeNodeResolver`, which creates a new function that is bound to `deferred` and then immediately discards it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
