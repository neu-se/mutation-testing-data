  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_wrongFile
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_writeFile` function is renamed to `_wrongFile`, causing the code to fail because the function is no longer recognized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now bound to the `null` object, causing the code to fail because the `this` context is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function wrongFile(file, obj, options) {
  _writeFile(file, obj, options);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function signature is changed, causing the code to fail because the parameters are not being passed correctly.
