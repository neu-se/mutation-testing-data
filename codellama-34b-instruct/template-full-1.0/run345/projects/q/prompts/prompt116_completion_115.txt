  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value of `this` is passed as the second argument to the `callback` function, but with `true` it would pass the value `true` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value of `this` is passed as the second argument to the `callback` function, but with `self` it would pass the value of `self` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value of `this` is passed as the second argument to the `callback` function, but with `void 0` it would pass the value `undefined` instead.

DONE.
