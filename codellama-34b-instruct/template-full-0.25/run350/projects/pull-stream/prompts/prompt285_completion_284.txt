  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` only passes the `data` argument to the callback, while this new code fragment passes both `null` and `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` only passes the `data` argument to the callback, while this new code fragment passes both `data` and `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` passes both `end` and `data` arguments to the callback, while this new code fragment only passes `data`.

DONE.
