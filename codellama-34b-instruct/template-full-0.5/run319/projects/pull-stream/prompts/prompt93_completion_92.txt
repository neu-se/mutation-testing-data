  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code fragment only passed one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is a variable that may be undefined, but the original code fragment assumed it was defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a variable that may be undefined, but the original code fragment assumed it was defined.

DONE.
