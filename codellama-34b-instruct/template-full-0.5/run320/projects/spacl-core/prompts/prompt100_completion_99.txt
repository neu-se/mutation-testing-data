  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a new string that is a subset of the original `path` string, which could cause the `query` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would return a new string that has all uppercase characters, which could cause the `query` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').join('\\')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` and `join` methods would return a new string that has all the path separators replaced with backslashes, which could cause the `query` method to return a different result.

DONE.
