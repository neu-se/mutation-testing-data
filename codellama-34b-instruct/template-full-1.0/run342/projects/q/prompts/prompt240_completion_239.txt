  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lead to infinite recursion, as `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch` would call `nearer` again, which would call `promiseDispatch` again, and so on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue != resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, as `nearerValue` and `resolvedPromise` would always be the same object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue != resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, as `nearerValue` and `resolvedPromise.promise` would always be the same object.

DONE.
