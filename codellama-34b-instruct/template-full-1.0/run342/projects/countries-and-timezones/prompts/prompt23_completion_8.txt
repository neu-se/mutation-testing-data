  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"":getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getOffsetStr()` is not called, and a blank string is returned instead of a formatted offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"UTC" + getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getOffsetStr()` is called with a different argument, and the resulting string will include the "UTC" prefix.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"GMT" + getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getOffsetStr()` is called with a different argument, and the resulting string will include the "GMT" prefix.

DONE.
