  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` would return an integer value, while `parseFloat` returns a floating-point value. This could cause issues with the accuracy of the calculations performed using these values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var b = 2 * Math.random();
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` would be random, while in the original code it's a constant. This could cause the calculations to behave differently and cause errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to its argument, while `parseFloat` returns the closest floating-point value to its argument. This could cause issues with the accuracy of the calculations performed using these values.

DONE.
