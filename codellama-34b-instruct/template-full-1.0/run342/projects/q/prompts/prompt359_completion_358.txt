  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newValue
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.tap` would be called with `newValue` instead of `value`, which could potentially change the behavior of the `tap` promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.tap` would be called with `null` instead of `value`, which could potentially change the behavior of the `tap` promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.tap` would be called with `undefined` instead of `value`, which could potentially change the behavior of the `tap` promise.

DONE.
