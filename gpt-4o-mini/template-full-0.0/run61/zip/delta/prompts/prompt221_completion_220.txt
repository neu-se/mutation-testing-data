Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const diffResult = <PLACEHOLDER>(strings[1], strings[0], cursor);
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the strings being compared, potentially leading to incorrect diff results as the context of the comparison changes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const diffResult = <PLACEHOLDER>(strings[0], strings[1], undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `undefined` as the cursor instead of the actual cursor value, which may lead to incorrect handling of the diff operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const diffResult = <PLACEHOLDER>(strings[0], strings[1], cursor + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the cursor by 1, which may cause the diff operation to start from an incorrect position, leading to inaccurate results.

DONE.
