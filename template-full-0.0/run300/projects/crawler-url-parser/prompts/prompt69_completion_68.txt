  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the protocol from the URL, while this new code fragment removes the protocol and the domain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '').replace(/\/$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the protocol and the trailing slash from the URL, while this new code fragment removes the protocol, the trailing slash, and the domain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '').replace(/\/$/, '').replace(/\./g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the protocol, the trailing slash, and the domain from the URL, while this new code fragment removes the protocol, the trailing slash, the domain, and all periods from the URL.
