  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last slash from the URL, while the new code fragment replaces it with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last slash from the URL, while the new code fragment removes the last slash and any characters after it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last slash from the URL, while the new code fragment replaces it with a space.

DONE.
