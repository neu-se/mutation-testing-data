  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match words that end with "quy".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/quy$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match words that end with a consonant followed by "y".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]y$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match words that end with a consonant followed by "y".

DONE.
