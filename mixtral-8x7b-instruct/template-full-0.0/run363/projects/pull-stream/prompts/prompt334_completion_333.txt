 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would receive `undefined` as the first argument instead of the `end` value, potentially causing issues if the calling code expects a truthy/falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would receive `null` as the first argument, which might cause unexpected behavior in the calling code, especially if it assumes the `end` value should be a string or a boolean.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'not end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would receive a string as the first argument, which could cause unexpected behavior in the calling code, as it would not be the expected `end` value.

DONE.
