  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not defined for a string, so it would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring of `currentUrlStr` starting from the second character, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the uppercase version of `currentUrlStr`, whereas the original code fragment returns the original string.

DONE.
