  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allRejected` is a different method than `allResolved`, and it would return a promise that is rejected with the reason from the first rejected promise in the array, rather than a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"any"
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different method than `allResolved`, and it would return a promise that is fulfilled with the value of the first resolved promise in the array, rather than a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"none"
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` is a different method than `allResolved`, and it would return a promise that is fulfilled with an empty array, rather than a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promises.

DONE.
