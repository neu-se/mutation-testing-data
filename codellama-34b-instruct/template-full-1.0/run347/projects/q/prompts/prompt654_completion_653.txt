  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with an error, rather than resolved with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(123)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value `123`, rather than the result of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify("progress")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified of progress, rather than resolved or rejected.

DONE.
