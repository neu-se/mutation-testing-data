  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first element of the `coordinates` array, whereas the original code fragment considers both elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the `coordinates` array, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `coordinates` array, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the array.

DONE.
