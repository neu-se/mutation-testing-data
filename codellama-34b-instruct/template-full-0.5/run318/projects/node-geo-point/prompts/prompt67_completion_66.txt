  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator changes the sign of the value, so the result of the `atan2` function would be negated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator adds 1 to the value, so the result of the `atan2` function would be shifted by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator doubles the value, so the result of the `atan2` function would be doubled.

DONE.
