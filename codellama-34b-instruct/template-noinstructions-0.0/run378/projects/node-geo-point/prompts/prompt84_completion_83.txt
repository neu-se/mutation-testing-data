  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cos` is a function that returns the cosine of a given angle, while `cos(φ1)` is a number that represents the cosine of the latitude of the point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cos` is a function that returns the cosine of a given angle, while `sin(φ1)` is a number that represents the sine of the latitude of the point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cos` is a function that returns the cosine of a given angle, while `tan(φ1)` is a number that represents the tangent of the latitude of the point.

DONE.
