  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "0". This would result in different behavior because it would ensure that the code fragment always returns a positive integer, even if the input value is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "Math.abs(n)". This would result in different behavior because it would make the code fragment return the absolute value of the input, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "n > 0 ? n : -n". This would result in different behavior because it would make the code fragment return the absolute value of the input, rather than the original value.

DONE.
