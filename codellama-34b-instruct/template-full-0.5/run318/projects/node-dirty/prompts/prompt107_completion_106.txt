  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `val` property would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `set` method to store a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `val` property would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the `set` method to store a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `val` property would be set to `null`, which would cause the `set` method to store a different value than the original code.

DONE.
