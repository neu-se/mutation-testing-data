  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the `keepNull` variable, making it always `true` instead of `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull && attributes[key] != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only remove `null` values if the `keepNull` variable is `false`, instead of always removing them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only remove `null` values if they are the same as the `null` value, instead of checking if they are not equal to the `null` value.

DONE.
