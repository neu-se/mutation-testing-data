  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent any error handlers registered with `Q.onerror` from being called, which could cause errors to be silently ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Q.onerror was called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause any errors that occur within the `Q` library to be thrown as exceptions, rather than being handled by the `Q.onerror` handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { console.log("Q.onerror was called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause any errors that occur within the `Q` library to be logged to the console, rather than being handled by the `Q.onerror` handler.

DONE.
