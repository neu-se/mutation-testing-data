  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code called `this.close()` without any arguments, whereas this new code calls it with `null` as the argument, which could potentially cause the `close` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code called `this.close()` without any arguments, whereas this new code calls it with `true` as the argument, which could potentially cause the `close` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code called `this.close()` without any arguments, whereas this new code calls it with `false` as the argument, which could potentially cause the `close` method to behave differently.

DONE.
