  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ ''` operator converts the `data` variable to a string, which could cause issues if the `data` variable is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of the `data` variable. This could cause issues if the `data` variable is not a boolean.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method returns a string representing the `data` variable, which could cause issues if the `data` variable is not an object with a `toString()` method.

DONE.
