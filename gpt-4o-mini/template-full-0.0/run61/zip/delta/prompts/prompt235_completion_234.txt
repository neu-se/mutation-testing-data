Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to read one more operation than intended, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect data being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it reads one less operation than intended, which could cause the resulting delta to miss an operation, leading to incorrect diffs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, potentially mixing up the operations from the two different deltas, leading to incorrect results in the diff operation.

DONE.
