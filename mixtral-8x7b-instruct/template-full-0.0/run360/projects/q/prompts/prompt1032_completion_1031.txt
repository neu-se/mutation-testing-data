 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
void nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void` operator would discard the `nodeback` function, and the callback would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed to `Q.nextTick` instead of the `nodeback` function, and the callback would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed to `Q.nextTick` instead of the `nodeback` function, and the callback would not be called with the correct arguments.

DONE.
