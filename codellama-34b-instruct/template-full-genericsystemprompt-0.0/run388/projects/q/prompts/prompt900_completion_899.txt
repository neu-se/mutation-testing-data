  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called immediately, rather than being passed as a reference to the `setTimeout` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function that is bound to the `deferred` object, rather than being called immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method calls the `makeNodeResolver` method immediately, rather than passing it as a reference to the `setTimeout` function.

DONE.
