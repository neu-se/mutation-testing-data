  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to always return the original `Delta` object, regardless of the `other` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to always return an empty `Delta` object, regardless of the `other` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to always return the `other` `Delta` object, regardless of the `this` parameter.

DONE.
