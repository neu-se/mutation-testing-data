 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(answerPs[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` will immediately resolve the promise, bypassing the original logic that checks for the settled state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(answerPs[i])
