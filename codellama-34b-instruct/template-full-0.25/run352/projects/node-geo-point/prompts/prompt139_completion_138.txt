  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the longitude value, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the latitude value, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.latitude + this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the sum of the latitude and longitude values, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
