Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sw + 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an extra character 'x' to the switch string, potentially affecting the formatting and display of the options table.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sw.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the switch string to uppercase, which might not be the intended display format for the options table, potentially affecting readability and user experience.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.alias[sw]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to retrieve the alias for the switch string, which might not always exist or might return an incorrect value, potentially causing errors or inconsistencies in the options table display.

DONE.
