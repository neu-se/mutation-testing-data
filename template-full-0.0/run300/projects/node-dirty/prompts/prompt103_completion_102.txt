  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is the value associated with the key, while `row.key` is the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the key, which would cause the code to access a different key in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the key to uppercase, which would cause the code to access a different key in the database.

DONE.
