  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds an element at a specific index in the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.concat([newOp])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array by combining the elements of two arrays, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
