  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|goat)\b/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new word "goat" is not present in the original code fragment, and therefore the test suite may not catch this change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|goose)\b/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new word "goose" is not present in the original code fragment, and therefore the test suite may not catch this change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|goat|goose)\b/i
