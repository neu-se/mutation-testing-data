  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two elements of the `other.ops` array, rather than just the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the first two elements of the `other.ops` array, rather than all elements from the second onwards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the last element of the `other.ops` array, rather than all elements from the second onwards.

DONE.
