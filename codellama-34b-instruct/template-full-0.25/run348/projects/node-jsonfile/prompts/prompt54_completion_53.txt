  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is now incremented by 1, which would cause the JSON string to be indented with an additional space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is now multiplied by 2, which would cause the JSON string to be indented with twice as many spaces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is now decremented by 1, which would cause the JSON string to be indented with one fewer space.

DONE.
