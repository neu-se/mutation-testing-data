  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeId++;
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` is a function that clears a timer set with `setTimeout`, whereas `nodeId++` is an increment expression that increases the value of the `nodeId` variable by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId--;
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` is a function that clears a timer set with `setTimeout`, whereas `timeoutId--` is a decrement expression that decreases the value of the `timeoutId` variable by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` is a function that clears a timer set with `setTimeout`, whereas `timeoutId = null` is an assignment expression that sets the value of the `timeoutId` variable to `null`.

DONE.
