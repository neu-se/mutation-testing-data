  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof pageurl === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while the new code fragment checks if it is an object. This change would cause the function to behave differently when `pageurl` is not a string, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
