  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the `error` object passed to the `nfapply` method, rather than the error object created in the `setTimeout` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the `error` object passed to the `nfapply` method, rather than the error object created in the `setTimeout` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.post(name, nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the `error` object passed to the `nfapply` method, rather than the error object created in the `setTimeout
