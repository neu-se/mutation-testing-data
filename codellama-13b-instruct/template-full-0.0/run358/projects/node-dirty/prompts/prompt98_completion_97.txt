  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'close' event is emitted when the read stream is closed, whereas the original code fragment emits the 'error' event when there is an error in the read stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'end' event is emitted when the read stream has reached the end of the file, whereas the original code fragment emits the 'error' event when there is an error in the read stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'data' event is emitted when there is data available in the read stream, whereas the original code fragment emits the 'error' event when there is an error in the read stream.

DONE.
