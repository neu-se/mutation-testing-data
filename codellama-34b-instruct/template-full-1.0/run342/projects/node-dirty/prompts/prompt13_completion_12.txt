  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.push(cb) > 0` would always evaluate to `true`, as `cbs.push(cb)` returns the new length of the array, which is always greater than zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.length === 0` would only be true if the length of the `cbs` array is zero, whereas `cbs.push(cb)` would always add an element to the array, making the `cbs.length > 0` condition always evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.includes(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.includes(cb)` would return `true` if `cb` is already in the `cbs` array, whereas `cbs.
