  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is different from the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args[0], args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the new first argument is `args[0]`, which is different from the original first argument `name`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args[1], args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the new first argument is `args[1]`, which is different from the original first argument `name`, and the new second argument is `args[0]`, which is different from the original second argument `args`.

DONE.
