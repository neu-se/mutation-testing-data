  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method that checks if an object has a property with the specified name, whereas `has` is a method that checks if an object has a specified value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.contains
```
This would result in different behavior because `contains` is a method that checks if an object contains a specified value, whereas `has` is a method that checks if an object has a specified value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method that checks if an object includes a specified value, whereas `has` is a method that checks if an object has a specified value.

DONE.
