 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses an undefined array element, which would not cause an error in the original code if the length of `ref` is 4.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last element of the `ref` array, whereas the original code accesses the fourth element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length--
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the length of the `ref` array, which could lead to unexpected results when accessing elements of the array.

DONE.
