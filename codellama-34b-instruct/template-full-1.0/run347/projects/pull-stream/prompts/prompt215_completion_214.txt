  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return err(err, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` function is not defined, and it would raise a `ReferenceError` exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return data(err, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` function is not defined, and it would raise a `ReferenceError` exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return map(data, function (err, data) { return err; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would be called with a different set of arguments, and it would return a different value.

DONE.
