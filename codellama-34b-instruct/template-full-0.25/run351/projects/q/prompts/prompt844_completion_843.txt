  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method expects an error object or a string as its second argument, and passing `null` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method expects an error object or a string as its second argument, and passing `undefined` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method expects an error object or a string as its second argument, and passing a new error object would cause the promise to be rejected with that error.

DONE.
