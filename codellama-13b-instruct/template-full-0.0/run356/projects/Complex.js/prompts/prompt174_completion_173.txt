  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 == d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to `0`, while the modified code fragment checks if `d` is equal to `0` using the `==` operator instead of the `===` operator. This could potentially cause issues if `d` is a string or other type that can be coerced to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to `0` using the `===` operator, while the modified code fragment checks if `d` is equal to `0` using the `==` operator. This could potentially cause issues if `d` is a string or other type that can be coerced to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is
