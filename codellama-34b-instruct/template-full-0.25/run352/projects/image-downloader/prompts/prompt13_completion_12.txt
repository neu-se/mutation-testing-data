  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` is a different function than `decodeURIComponent`, and it may not handle all possible inputs correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURIComponent` is a different function than `decodeURIComponent`, and it may not handle all possible inputs correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(basename).toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the decoded basename to lowercase, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
