 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(resolve => resolve(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because a new promise is created instead of resolving the existing deferred promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfill(value + 1)
