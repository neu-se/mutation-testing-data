  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = s
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a function that takes an argument, but `s` is a function that takes no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = s()
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a function that takes an argument, but `s()` is a function that returns a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = s.source
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a function that takes an argument, but `s.source` is a property that holds a reference to the function that created the current function.

DONE.
