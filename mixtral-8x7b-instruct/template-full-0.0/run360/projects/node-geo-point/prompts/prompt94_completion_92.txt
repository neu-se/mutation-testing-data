 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.asin` function expects a value between -1 and 1, while the original `asin` function is a placeholder for a custom implementation. Invoking `Math.asin` with a value outside the range [-1, 1] would result in a `MathDomainError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` calculates the arctangent of a number, which is not the same as the arcsine function. This would lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method, causing the calculated latitude to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` calculates the arc cosine of a number, which is not the same as the arcsine function
