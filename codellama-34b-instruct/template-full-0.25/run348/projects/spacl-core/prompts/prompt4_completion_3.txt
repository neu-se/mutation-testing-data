  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the constructor to accept paths that do not start with a slash, which is not allowed by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the constructor to accept paths that start with a slash, which is not allowed by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the constructor to accept paths that do not start with a slash, which is not allowed by the original code.

DONE.
