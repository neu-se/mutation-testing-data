  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = <PLACEHOLDER>(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is not called, which means that the latitude values are not converted to radians before being used in the calculation. This could cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point1.latitude) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because a constant value of 1 is added to the latitude value before it is converted to radians. This could cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point1.latitude) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is multiplied by 2 before it is converted to radians. This could cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
