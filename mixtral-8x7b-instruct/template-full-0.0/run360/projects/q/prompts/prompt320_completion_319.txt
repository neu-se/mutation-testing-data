 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptor[op].call
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the `op` method is called, potentially causing issues if `op` is a bound method or if `this` matters for the method's functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptor[op].bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` inside the `op` method to `null`, which might not be expected and could cause issues if the method relies on the original `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptor.op
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `op` property directly instead of using bracket notation, which would cause an error if the `op` variable is not defined or if the `op` property does not exist on the `descriptor` object.

DONE.
