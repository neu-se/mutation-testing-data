  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `null` is added to the array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on `nodeArgs`, which would return a new array with the first element removed. This would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.concat([null])]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `null` is added to the end of the `nodeArgs` array using the `concat` method. This would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

DONE.
