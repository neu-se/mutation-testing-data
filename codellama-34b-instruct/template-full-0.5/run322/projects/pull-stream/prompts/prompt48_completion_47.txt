  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to terminate early or skip over certain iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to iterate over more than the intended number of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would multiply `i` by 2 instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to iterate over more than the intended number of elements.

DONE.
