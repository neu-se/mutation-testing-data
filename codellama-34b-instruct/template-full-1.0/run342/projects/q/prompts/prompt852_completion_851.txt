  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method should receive an `Error` object as an argument, while `null` is not a valid error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a variable that holds a promise object, while the `reject` method expects a valid error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method expects a valid error object, while `undefined` is not a valid error object.

DONE.
