  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the line instead of pushing it, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip the line and not execute the predicate function on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the line instead of pushing it, which would cause the `eachLine` method to not execute the predicate function on the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a new line instead of pushing the current line, which would cause the `eachLine` method to execute the predicate function on the new line instead of the current line.

DONE.
