  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10 % (10 * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator (`%`) has a higher precedence than the multiplication operator (`*`), so the expression would be evaluated as `10 % (10 * 2)`, which is equivalent to `10 % 20`, which is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10 * (10 % 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator (`*`) has a higher precedence than the modulo operator (`%`), so the expression would be evaluated as `10 * (10 % 2)`, which is equivalent to `10 * 0`, which is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10 + (10 % 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator (`+`) has the same precedence as the modulo operator (`%`), so the expression would be
