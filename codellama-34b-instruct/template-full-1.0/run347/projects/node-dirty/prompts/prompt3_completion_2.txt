  Sure, here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with buggy code fragments that have different behavior:
```
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for both equality and nullity, while the `===` operator only checks for equality. In this case, replacing `val === undefined` with `val == null` would allow the `set` method to accept null values as well as undefined, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, while the `===` operator checks for equality. In this case, replacing `val === undefined` with `val != null` would allow the `set` method to accept any non-null value, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
