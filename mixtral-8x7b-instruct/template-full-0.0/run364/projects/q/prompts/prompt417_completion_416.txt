 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `inspect` function from the global object, which might not have the same implementation as the one in the `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Reflect.inspect
