 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset <= index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the offset to match the index when priority is true, which could cause an infinite loop or incorrect index manipulation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset + 1 < index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the offset comparison by 1, which could cause the loop to skip an 'insert' operation or result in incorrect index manipulation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset > index && !priority)
