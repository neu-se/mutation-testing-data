  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `test` function, causing the `filter` function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with the `data` argument, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with two arguments, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
