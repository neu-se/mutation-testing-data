  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate one extra time, which will result in an error when trying to access the non-existent element at index `tokens.length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > tokens.length
```
This change will cause the loop to never execute, as the condition is always false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= tokens.length
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate one extra time, which will result in an error when trying to access the non-existent element at index `tokens.length`.

DONE.
