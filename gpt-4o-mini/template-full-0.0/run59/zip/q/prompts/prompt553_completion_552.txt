Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.done
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `done` property of the result object instead of the `value`, which would lead to returning a boolean indicating if the generator has completed instead of the yielded value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the yielded value by adding 1 to it, which changes the output of the generator function and could lead to unexpected results in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `undefined` instead of the actual yielded value, which would cause the promise to resolve with `undefined`, potentially breaking the expected flow of data in the generator.

DONE.
