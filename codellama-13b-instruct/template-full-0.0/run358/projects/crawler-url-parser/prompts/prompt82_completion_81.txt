  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$
```
This would result in different behavior because the dollar sign is a special character in JavaScript that represents the global object, whereas the original code fragment is an empty string. This would cause the code to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be trying to access the `href` attribute of the current element using jQuery, whereas the original code fragment was an empty string. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be trying to access the `href` attribute of the current element using jQuery, and then replace any semicolon followed by any number of characters at the end of the string with an empty string. This could potentially cause the code
