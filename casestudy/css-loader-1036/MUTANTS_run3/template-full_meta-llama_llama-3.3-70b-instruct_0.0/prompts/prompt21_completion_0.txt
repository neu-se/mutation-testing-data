Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cssMapping.sources.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas the original `map` method returns a new array with the results of applying the provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cssMapping.sources.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas the original `map` method applies a transformation to each element of the array and returns the results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(item) => [cssMapping.sourceRoot || '']
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment returns an array with a single element, the source root of the CSS mapping, whereas the original `map` method returns an array of source URLs for each source in the CSS mapping.

DONE.
