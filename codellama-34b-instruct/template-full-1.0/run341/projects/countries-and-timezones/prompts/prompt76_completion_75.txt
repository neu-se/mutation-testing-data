  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!timezone
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!!` operator is the logical NOT operator, which returns `true` if the operand is truthy, and `false` otherwise. In this case, it would always return `false`, regardless of the value of `timezone`. This would cause the `memoizeTimezone` function to always execute the `return` statement, regardless of whether the `timezone` object is empty or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator is the equality operator, which checks whether the operands are not equal. In this case, it would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `timezone`. This would cause the `memoizeTimezone` function to always execute the `return` statement, regardless of whether the `timezone` object is empty or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.length
