  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be pushed onto the `nodeArgs` array, rather than the original `nodeArgs.push` method being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be pushed onto the `nodeArgs` array, rather than the original `nodeArgs.push` method being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve(null)` method call would be executed immediately, rather than waiting for the `nodeArgs.push` method to be called.

DONE.
