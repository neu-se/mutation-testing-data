  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a different number of arguments, which could cause issues for any code that is listening for the `load` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 'foo');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a different type of argument, which could cause issues for any code that is listening for the `load` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', {foo: 'bar'});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a different type of argument, which could cause issues for any code that is listening for the `load` event.

DONE.
