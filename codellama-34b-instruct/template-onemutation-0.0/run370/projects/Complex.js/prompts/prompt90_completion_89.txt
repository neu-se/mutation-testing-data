  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1] + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional '1' would cause the parser to interpret the next token as a number, even if it is not. This would lead to incorrect parsing of the input string and potentially cause the parser to exit with an error.

DONE.
