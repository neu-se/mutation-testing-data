 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` callback's return promise would be resolved immediately, instead of waiting for the callback to finish executing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(new Error('Callback error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` callback's return promise would be rejected with a new error, instead of propagating the original rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` callback's return promise would be immediately resolved with a null value, instead of waiting for the callback to finish executing and propagating the original resolution or rejection.

DONE.
