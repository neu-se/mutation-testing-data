  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.deprecated` parameter is not being passed to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options.timezone
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.timezone` parameter is not being passed to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options.country
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.country` parameter is not being passed to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected country object.

DONE.
