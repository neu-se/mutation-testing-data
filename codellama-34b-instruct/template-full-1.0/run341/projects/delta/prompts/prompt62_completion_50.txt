  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of all properties in an object, while `Object.prototype.length` returns the number of enumerable properties in an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of all properties in an object, while `Object.values` returns an array of all property values in an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of all properties in an object, while `Object.entries` returns an array of all [key, value] pairs in an object.

DONE.
