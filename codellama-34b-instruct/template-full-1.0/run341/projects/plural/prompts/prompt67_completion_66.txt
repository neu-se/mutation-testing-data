  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an "s" to the root word, while this code fragment would simply replace the root word with "memos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memoirs'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an "s" to the root word, while this code fragment would replace the root word with "memoirs".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Memories'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an "s" to the root word, while this code fragment would replace the root word with "Memories".

DONE.
