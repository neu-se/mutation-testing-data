  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that returns a promise that is fulfilled when all items in an array are fulfilled, whereas `any` is a method that returns a promise that is fulfilled when any item in an array is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` is a method that returns a promise that is fulfilled when no item in an array is fulfilled, whereas `any` is a method that returns a promise that is fulfilled when any item in an array is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` is a method that returns a promise that is fulfilled when the predicate function returns a truthy value for at least one item in the array, whereas `any` is a method that returns a promise that is fulfilled when any item in an array is fulfilled.
