  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timeout` is equal to `void 0`, which is a way to check if a variable is undefined. Replacing it with `!==` would cause the code to check if `timeout` is not equal to `void 0`, which would always evaluate to `true` and result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timeout` is equal to `void 0`, which is a way to check if a variable is undefined. Replacing it with `!== null` would cause the code to check if `timeout` is not equal to `null`, which would always evaluate to `true` and result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timeout` is equal
