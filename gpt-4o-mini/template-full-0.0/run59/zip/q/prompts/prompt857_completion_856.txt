Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(timeoutId, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of clearing the timeout, it incorrectly schedules the timeout to execute immediately, potentially leading to the timeout error being triggered even if the promise resolves successfully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `timeoutId` to `null` does not clear the existing timeout, which means the timeout will still execute after the specified duration, leading to a potential timeout rejection even if the promise resolves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval(timeoutId);
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is intended to stop a recurring timer set by `setInterval`, not a one-time timer set by `setTimeout`, which would leave the timeout active and potentially cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
