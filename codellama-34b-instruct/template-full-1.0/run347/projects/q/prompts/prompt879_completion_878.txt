  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject.apply(deferred, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with the arguments passed to the callback, rather than the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify.apply(deferred, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` function would be called with the arguments passed to the callback, rather than the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would not be called at all, rather than being called with the resolved value.

DONE.
