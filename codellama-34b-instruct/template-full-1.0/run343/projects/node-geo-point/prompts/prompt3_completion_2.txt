  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude <= -180 || longitude >= 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for strict inequality, but this replacement checks for non-strict inequality. This means that if the input longitude is exactly -180 or 180, it would not be rejected, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude % 360 == -180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for strict inequality, but this replacement uses the modulo operator to check if the longitude is equal to -180. This would result in a false positive if the input longitude is -540, which would not be caught by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(longitude) >= 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for strict inequality, but this replacement uses the
