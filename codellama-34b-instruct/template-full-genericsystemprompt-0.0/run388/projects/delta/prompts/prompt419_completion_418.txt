  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operation would be skipped, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && offset >= index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` operation would be applied even if the offset is greater than the index, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'delete' && offset <= index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be applied even if the offset is less than or equal to the index, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
