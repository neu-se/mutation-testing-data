  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the wrong strings, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare individual characters instead of the whole strings, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].split('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare individual lines instead of the whole strings, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
