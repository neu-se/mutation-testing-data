  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the conditions has been reversed, which could cause the code to evaluate to a different result in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical OR operator has been used instead of the logical AND operator, which could cause the code to evaluate to a different result in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the inequality operator has been used instead of the equality operator, which could cause the code to evaluate to a different result in certain cases.

DONE.
