  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated first, and then the result of that expression would be `&&` with `done`. This would cause the `sink.abort` function to always return `true`, even if `done` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done ? function () {} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated first, and then the result of that expression would be `?` with `done`. This would cause the `sink.abort` function to always return `null`, even if `done` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done ? function () {} : undefined
```
This would result in
