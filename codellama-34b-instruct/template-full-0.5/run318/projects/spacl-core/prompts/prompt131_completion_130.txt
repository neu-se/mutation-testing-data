  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === null || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `undefined`, and the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality. In the original code, `prop === undefined` checks if `prop` is `undefined`, but `prop === null` checks if `prop` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined && match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` checks for value inequality, and `prop !== undefined` checks if `prop` is not `undefined`. In the original code, `prop === undefined` checks if `prop` is `undefined`.
