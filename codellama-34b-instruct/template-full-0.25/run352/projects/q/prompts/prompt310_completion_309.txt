  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to `Q` is reversed, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, reject, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `resolve` is added, which would cause the promise to be resolved twice, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject, reject, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the first `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, and the second `reject` would be ignored, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
