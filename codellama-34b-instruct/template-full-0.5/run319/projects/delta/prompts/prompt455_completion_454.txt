  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `ops` array from the current index, while this replacement slices the array from the next index, which could result in a different subset of the array being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `ops` array from the current index, while this replacement slices the array from the previous index, which could result in a different subset of the array being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + this.offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `ops` array from the current index, while this replacement slices the array from the current index plus the current offset, which could result in a different subset
