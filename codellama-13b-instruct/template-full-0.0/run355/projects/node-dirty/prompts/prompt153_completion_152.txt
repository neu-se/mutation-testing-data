  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork()` method is called on the write stream, which would prevent any further writes to the stream until the `uncork()` method is called. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is expecting the write stream to be uncorked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork()` method is called on the write stream, which would allow any further writes to the stream. This could cause the test suite to pass if it is expecting the write stream to be uncorked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method is called on the write stream, which would close the stream and prevent any further writes to it. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is expecting the write
