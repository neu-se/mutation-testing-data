Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `data` by adding 1 to it, which changes the output of the `mapper` function and could lead to incorrect results if the intention was to pass the original `data` unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `data` with `undefined`, which would cause the `mapper` function to receive `undefined` instead of the actual data, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors in the mapping process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the `data` by multiplying it by 2, which changes the output of the `mapper` function and could lead to incorrect results if the intention was to map the original `data` directly.

DONE.
