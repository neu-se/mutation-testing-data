 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\..+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that starts with '/index.' followed by one or more characters, instead of matching only strings that end with '/index.[a-z]+'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\.[a-z]+\//, ''
