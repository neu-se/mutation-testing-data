 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"notAnOp"
```
This would result in different behavior because the fallback function would be called with the string "notAnOp" instead of the actual operation name, which could cause unexpected behavior in the fallback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the fallback function would be called with the number 123 instead of the actual operation name, which could cause unexpected behavior in the fallback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the fallback function would be called with the promise object instead of the actual operation name, which could cause unexpected behavior in the fallback function.

DONE.
