  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.peek().attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the attributes of the next operation in the iterator to the predicate function, instead of the attributes of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty object as the attributes to the predicate function, instead of the attributes of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.peek().attributes, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the attributes of the next operation in the iterator to the predicate function, instead of the attributes of the current operation.

DONE.
