  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNan']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to return `NAN` instead of `INFINITY` when dividing by zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to return `FINITE` instead of `INFINITY` when dividing by zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['divideByZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to throw a division by zero error when dividing by zero.

DONE.
