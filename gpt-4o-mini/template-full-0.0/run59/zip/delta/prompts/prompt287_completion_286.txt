Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly process lines when the index is positive, potentially skipping valid lines that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only process lines when the index is exactly zero, ignoring all other lines and potentially leading to incomplete processing of the Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would process lines when the index is not zero, which could lead to skipping the first line or processing lines incorrectly based on their index.

DONE.
