  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(point1Rad, point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the arctangent of the ratio of the two radian values, which would give a different result than the original code that used the arctangent of the difference of the two radian values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1Rad - point2Rad) * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the difference between the two radian values by pi, which would give a different result than the original code that only used the difference between the two radian values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI - point1Rad + point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the radian value of point 1 from pi and then add the radian value of point 2, which would give a different result than the original code that only used the difference between the two
