  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isSafeInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isSafeInteger` checks if a number is a safe integer, which is an integer that can be exactly represented as a double precision floating point number, whereas `Number.isFinite` checks if a number is finite, which includes all numbers that are not NaN, positive infinity, or negative infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isInteger` checks if a number is an integer, which includes all numbers that are not NaN, positive infinity, negative infinity, or fractions, whereas `Number.isFinite` checks if a number is finite, which includes all numbers that are not NaN, positive infinity, or negative infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a number is NaN, which is a special value
