  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!loop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `loop`, causing the loop to continue even if `loop` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the value of `loop`, causing the loop to iterate one extra time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator subtracts 1 from the value of `loop`, causing the loop to iterate one less time.

DONE.
