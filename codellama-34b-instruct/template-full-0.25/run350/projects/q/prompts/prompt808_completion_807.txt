  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.finally` would not be called with the expected `object` argument, which could cause the promise chain to be resolved or rejected unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.finally` would not be called with the expected `object` argument, which could cause the promise chain to be resolved or rejected unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.finally` would not be called with the expected `object` argument, which could cause the promise chain to be resolved or rejected unexpectedly.

DONE.
