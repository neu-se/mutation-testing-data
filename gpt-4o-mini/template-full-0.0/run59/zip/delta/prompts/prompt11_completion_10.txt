Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of `b` instead of `a`, potentially missing attributes that are defined in `a` but not in `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key of Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the iteration method from a `for...in` loop (which iterates over all enumerable properties) to a `for...of` loop that only iterates over the keys returned by `Object.keys(a)`, which may not include inherited properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in { ...a, ...b }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object that combines both `a` and `b`, which could lead to unexpected results if there are overlapping keys, as it would prioritize the values from `b` over those from `a`.

DONE.
