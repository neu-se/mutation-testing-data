  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.val` property would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` call to throw an error, even if the `rowStr` is a valid JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` property would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` call to throw an error, even if the `rowStr` is a valid JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.val` property would be set to `null`, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` call to return `null`, even if the `rowStr` is a valid JSON string.

DONE.
