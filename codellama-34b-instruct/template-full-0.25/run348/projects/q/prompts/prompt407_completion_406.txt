  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of `isPromise(value)`, so if `isPromise(value)` returns `true`, `!isPromise(value)` would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike(value)` checks if `value` is a promise-like object, which means it has a `then` method. This would allow the code to handle promises that are not instances of the `Promise` class, but are still promise-like.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPending(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending(value)` checks if `value` is a pending promise, meaning it has not been resolved or rejected yet. If `value` is
