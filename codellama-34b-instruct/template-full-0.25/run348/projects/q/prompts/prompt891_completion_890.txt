  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `args` variable, which is an array of arguments passed to the `nfcall` function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to receive a `null` value instead of an array, which could potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `args` variable, which is an array of arguments passed to the `nfcall` function. Replacing it with an empty array `[]` would cause the function to receive an empty array instead of the original array of arguments, which could potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `args` variable, which is an array of arguments passed to the `nfcall` function. Replacing it with `undefined
