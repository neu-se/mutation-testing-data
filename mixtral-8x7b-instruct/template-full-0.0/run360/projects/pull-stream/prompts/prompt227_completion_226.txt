 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => data === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null values instead of testing for any falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the result of the `test` function, which might not be the intended behavior for the `filterNot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => Array.isArray(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the data is an array, rather than testing the data itself.

These changes would help reveal potential weaknesses in the test suite by introducing different behaviors that might not be covered by the existing tests. DONE.
