  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the array contains the specified element, whereas `array_indexOf` checks if the array contains the specified value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise === unhandledRejections[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise === unhandledRejections[0]` checks if the promise is the first element in the array, whereas `array_indexOf` checks if the promise is in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect().state === "rejected"` checks if the promise is in the rejected state, whereas `array_indexOf` does not check the state of the promise.

DONE.
