 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'dice' && 'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple string 'die', while the modified fragment is a boolean expression that always evaluates to 'dice'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'dice' || 'die'
