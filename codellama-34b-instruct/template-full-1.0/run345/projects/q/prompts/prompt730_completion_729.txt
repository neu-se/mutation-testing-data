  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, causing the `all` method to return a rejected promise, whereas `deferred.notify` would send a notification, allowing the `all` method to continue waiting for the remaining promises to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.notify` would send a notification to the promise itself, whereas `deferred.notify` would send a notification to the deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.notify` would send a notification using the `Q` object, whereas `deferred.notify` would send a notification using the deferred object.

DONE.
