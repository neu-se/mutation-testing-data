  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function would return a different value, which could cause the `promiseDispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function would return a different value, which could cause the `promiseDispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function would return a different value, which could cause the `promiseDispatch` method to behave differently.

DONE.
