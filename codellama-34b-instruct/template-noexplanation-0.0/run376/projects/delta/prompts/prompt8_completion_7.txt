  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== undefined
```
This change will cause the `reduce` function to include `null` values in the resulting object, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== null
```
This change will cause the `reduce` function to exclude `null` values from the resulting object, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== undefined && attributes[key] !== null
```
This change will cause the `reduce` function to exclude `null` and `undefined` values from the resulting object, which may be the desired behavior.

DONE.
