  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is called with an error object, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'Test data')
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is called with a non-error argument, which would cause the test to succeed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'Test data')
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is called with a non-error argument, which would cause the test to succeed.

DONE.
