  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === null` would return `true` if `b` is `null`, but the original code fragment would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `b instanceof Object` would return `true` if `b` is an object, but the original code fragment would return `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `b.constructor === Object` would return `true` if `b` is an object, but the original code fragment would return `false` in that case.

DONE.
