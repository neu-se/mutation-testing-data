  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is Not-a-Number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the value is a finite number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinity']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinity` is not a valid property or method in JavaScript, and would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
