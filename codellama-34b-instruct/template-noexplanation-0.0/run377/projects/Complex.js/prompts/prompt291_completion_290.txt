  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This change will cause the `tan` function to return the sine of the complex number instead of the tangent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This change will cause the `tan` function to return the hyperbolic cosine of the complex number instead of the tangent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This change will cause the `tan` function to return the inverse cosine of the complex number instead of the tangent.

DONE.
