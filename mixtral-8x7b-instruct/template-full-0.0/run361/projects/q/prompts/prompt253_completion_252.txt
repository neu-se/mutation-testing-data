 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(deferred, message);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred` object to be used instead of the `newPromise` object for the `promiseDispatch` method, potentially causing issues with promise resolution and rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(promise, message);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise` object to be used instead of the `newPromise` object for the `promiseDispatch` method, potentially causing issues with promise resolution and rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newPromise.promiseDispatch(resolve, op, operands);
