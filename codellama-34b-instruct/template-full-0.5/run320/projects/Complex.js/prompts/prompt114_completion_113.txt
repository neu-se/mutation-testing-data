  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex(a, b);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new Complex object with the same real and imaginary parts as the original, rather than a new Complex object with the real and imaginary parts swapped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex(b, a);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new Complex object with the real and imaginary parts swapped, rather than the original real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex(a + b, a - b);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new Complex object with the real part equal to the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the original, and the imaginary part equal to the difference between the real and imaginary parts of the original.

DONE.
