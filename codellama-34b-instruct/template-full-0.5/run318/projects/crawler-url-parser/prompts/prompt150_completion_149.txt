  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the forward slash (/) as a delimiter to split the path into an array of parts. By replacing it with a backslash (\\), the path will be split into different parts, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the forward slash (/) as a delimiter to split the path into an array of parts. By replacing it with an empty string, the path will not be split into parts, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the forward slash (/) as a delimiter to split the path into an array of parts. By replacing it with null, the path will not be split into parts, which may cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
