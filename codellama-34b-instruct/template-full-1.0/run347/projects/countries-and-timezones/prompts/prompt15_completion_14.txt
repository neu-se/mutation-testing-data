  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `tz.r` is undefined, while this mutant checks if it is not undefined. If `tz.r` is undefined in the original code, it would return `null` and not call `buildCountry`, while this mutant would call `buildCountry` and potentially return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== undefined && tz.r.c !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `tz.r` is undefined, while this mutant checks if it is not undefined and its `c` property is also not undefined. If `tz.r` is undefined in the original code, it would return `null` and not call `buildCountry`, while this mutant would call `buildCountry` and potentially return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === undefined && tz
