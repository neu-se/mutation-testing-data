  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(index\.)[a-z]$/, '$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$&` placeholder to replace the entire match, while the new code fragment uses `$1` to replace only the first capturing group.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(index\.)[a-z]/, '$& $&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$&` placeholder to replace the entire match, while the new code fragment uses `$&` to replace the entire match concatenated with a space and another copy of the match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(index\.)[a-z]/, 'ø/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$&` placeholder to replace the entire match, while the new code fragment uses the literal string `ø/` to replace the match.

DONE.
