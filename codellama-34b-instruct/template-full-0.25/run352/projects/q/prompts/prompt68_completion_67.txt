  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, but this modified code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment continues to execute the next line of code, but this modified code fragment returns early and skips the remaining code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call `domain.exit()`, but this modified code fragment does.

DONE.
