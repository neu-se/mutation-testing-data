  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `op`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `op` is `false`, and `false` when `op` is `true`. This would cause the `read` function to be called with `abort` set to `true` when `op` is `false`, which would result in the stream being aborted prematurely.

DONE.
