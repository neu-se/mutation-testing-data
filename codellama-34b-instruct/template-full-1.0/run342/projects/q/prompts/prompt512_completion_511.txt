  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` only returns the keys of an object, while `object_keys` is a hypothetical function that returns both keys and values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` only returns the values of an object, while `object_keys` is a hypothetical function that returns both keys and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs of an object, while `object_keys` is a hypothetical function that returns both keys and values.

DONE.
