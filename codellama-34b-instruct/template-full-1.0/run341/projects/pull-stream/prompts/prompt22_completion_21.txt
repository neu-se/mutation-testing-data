  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s[i]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `i`th element of the `s` array as a function, which may or may not exist depending on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `i`th element of the `s` array, which may or may not exist depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `(i + 1)`th element of the `s` array, which may or may not exist depending on the input.

DONE.
