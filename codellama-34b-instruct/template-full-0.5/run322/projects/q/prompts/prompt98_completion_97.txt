  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the index instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to run indefinitely or until an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the index by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to skip over some values and potentially exiting the loop prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the index by 1, but the addition operator would be explicit instead of implicit, which could make the code more readable or more explicit.

DONE.
