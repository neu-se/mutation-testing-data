 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object does not have the same properties as the `newOp` object, causing the `push` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` does not have any properties, causing the `push` method to treat `newOp` as a plain value instead of an object with properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number, causing the `push` method to treat `newOp` as a plain value instead of an object with properties.

DONE.
