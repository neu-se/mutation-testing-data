  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress + 1` would increase the progress counter by 1, while `progress` would keep the progress counter unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress - 1` would decrease the progress counter by 1, while `progress` would keep the progress counter unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * progress
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 * progress` would double the progress counter, while `progress` would keep the progress counter unchanged.

DONE.
