  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the next operation in the other iterator, which could cause the algorithm to skip over certain operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the next operation in the this iterator, which could cause the algorithm to include extra operations in the diff.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the maximum of the lengths of the next operations in the two iterators, which could cause the algorithm to include more operations in the diff.

DONE.
