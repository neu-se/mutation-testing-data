  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid JSON value, but it is not the same as `undefined`, which is the value that is expected to be stored in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is a valid JSON value, but it is not the same as `undefined`, which is the value that is expected to be stored in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a valid JSON value, but it is not the same as `undefined`, which is the value that is expected to be stored in the database.

DONE.
