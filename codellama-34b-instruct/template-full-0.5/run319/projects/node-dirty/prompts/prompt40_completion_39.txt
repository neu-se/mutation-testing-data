  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `fn` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `fn` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fn
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `fn` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is falsy.

DONE.
