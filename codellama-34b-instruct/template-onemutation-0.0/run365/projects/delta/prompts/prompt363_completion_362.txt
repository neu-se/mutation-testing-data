  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `otherIter` iterator had any more elements, while the new code fragment is checking if the `otherIter` iterator has a `hasNext` method, which is always true.
