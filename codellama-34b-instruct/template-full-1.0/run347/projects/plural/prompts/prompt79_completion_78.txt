  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'goose' has a different plural form than 'gooses'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'geese' has a different singular form than 'goose'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' => 'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'goose' would be mapped to 'gooses' instead of 'goose'.

DONE.
