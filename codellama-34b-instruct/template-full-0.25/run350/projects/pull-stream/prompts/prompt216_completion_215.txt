  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the `map` function, while `null` is a literal value that is not a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the `map` function, while `undefined` is a literal value that is not a variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the `map` function, while `"error"` is a literal string value that is not a variable.

DONE.
