  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `ref[1]`, which reads the value at index 1 of the `ref` array, but the new code fragment reads the value at index 2 of the `ref` array instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `ref[1]`, which reads the value at index 1 of the `ref` array, but the new code fragment reads the entire `ref` array instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `ref[1]`, which reads the value at index 1 of the `ref` array, but the new code fragment reads the length of the `ref` array instead.

DONE.
