  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, meaning that `nextType` would have to be not only a string, but also a string that is not "delete". This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `nextType` is a string that is not "delete", even if it is not a string at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, meaning that `nextType` would have to be not only a string, but also a string that is not "insert". This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `nextType` is a string that is not "insert", even if it is not a string at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
