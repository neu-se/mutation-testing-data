  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` and the `else` statement to always be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is being called with the `src` variable as an argument, which is not what the original code does. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `else` statement to never be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is being called with the `src` variable as an argument and the `true` value as a second argument, which is not what the original code does. This would cause the `if`
