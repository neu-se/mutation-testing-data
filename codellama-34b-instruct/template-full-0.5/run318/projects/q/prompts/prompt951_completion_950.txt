  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` refers to the function's arguments object, whereas `null` would refer to a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` refers to the function's arguments object, whereas `undefined` would refer to an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` refers to the function's arguments object, whereas `[]` would refer to an empty array.

DONE.
