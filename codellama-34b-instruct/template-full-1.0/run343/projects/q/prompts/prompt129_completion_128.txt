  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with the following code fragment:
```
if (object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)) {
    keys.push(key);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the hasOwnProperty method is necessary to check if the property is defined on the object itself and not its inherited prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with the following code fragment:
```
if (object.key !== undefined) {
    keys.push(key);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because using "===" operator would cause a stricter comparison and return false in case the property is defined in the prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with the following code fragment:
```
let value = object[key];
if (value !== undefined) {
    keys.push(key);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because using a variable to store the value of the property is a good practice and provides better readability.

DONE.
