  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!embedType || embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `embedType` is not null or undefined, while the buggy code fragment checks if the `embedType` is not null or undefined and also checks if the `embedType` is not equal to the `Object.keys(b)[0]`. This would cause the code to throw an error if the `embedType` is not equal to the `Object.keys(b)[0]`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `embedType` is not null or undefined, while the buggy code fragment only checks if the `embedType` is not equal to the `Object.keys(b)[0]`. This would cause the code to throw an error if the `embedType` is null or undefined, which is not the intended
