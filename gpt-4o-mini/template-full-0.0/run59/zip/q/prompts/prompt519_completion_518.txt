Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise immediately instead of notifying about its progress, potentially leading to missed updates on the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, regardless of the actual state of the original promise, leading to incorrect error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify.bind(deferred, 'progress')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise of a 'progress' state instead of the actual state of the promise, which could confuse consumers expecting a different notification type.

DONE.
