  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the object has both properties, while this code fragment checks if the object has neither property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the object has both properties, while this code fragment checks if the object has at least one of the properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the object has both properties, while this code fragment checks if the object has only the 'longitude' property.

DONE.
