  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, whereas `pull.apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.curry
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.curry` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called, and returns a new function that,
