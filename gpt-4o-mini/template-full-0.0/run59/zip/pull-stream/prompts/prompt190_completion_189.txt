Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `map` is strictly equal to `null`, which would only return `true` if `map` is explicitly set to `null`, ignoring other falsy values like `undefined` or an empty function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `map` is an empty function (assuming `map` is a function), which would not account for the case where `map` is a valid function with a non-zero length, leading to incorrect handling of the mapping logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!map && typeof map !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `map` is falsy and also ensures that `map` is not a function, which would prevent valid function inputs from being processed correctly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the mapping process.

DONE.
