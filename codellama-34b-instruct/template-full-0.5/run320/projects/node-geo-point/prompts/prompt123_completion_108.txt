  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value of the `point` object instead of the latitude value, which could cause the `calculateBearing` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude value of the `point` object, which could cause the `calculateBearing` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the longitude value of the `point` object by 2, which could cause the `calculateBearing` function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
