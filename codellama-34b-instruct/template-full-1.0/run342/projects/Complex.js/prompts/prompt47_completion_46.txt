  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
('abs' in a && a !== null) && ('arg' in a && a !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` check was removed from the original expression, which could potentially cause a `TypeError` when `a` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
('abs' in a && 'arg' in b) || ('arg' in a && 'abs' in b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the two checks are combined with a logical OR, which could cause the `parse` function to return a complex number even if `a` or `b` is not a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
('abs' in a && 'arg' in b) || (a === null && 'arg' in b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second part of the expression checks if `a` is `null` and `arg` in
