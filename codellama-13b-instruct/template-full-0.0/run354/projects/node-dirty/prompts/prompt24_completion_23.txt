  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called immediately, rather than being added to the queue. This could cause issues if the callback function relies on the data being persisted to disk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called asynchronously, rather than being added to the queue. This could cause issues if the callback function relies on the data being persisted to disk.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called asynchronously, rather than being added to the queue. This could cause issues if the callback function relies on the data being persisted to disk.

DONE.
