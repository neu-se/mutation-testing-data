  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not remove the rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.
