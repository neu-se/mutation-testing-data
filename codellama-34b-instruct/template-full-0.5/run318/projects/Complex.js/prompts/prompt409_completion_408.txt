  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'], temp
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is swapping the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while this new code fragment is swapping the real part with itself, effectively doing nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'], temp
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is swapping the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while this new code fragment is swapping the imaginary part with itself, effectively doing nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] + x['im'], temp
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is swapping the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while this new code fragment is adding the real and imaginary parts and then swapping the result with the imaginary part, effectively changing the value of the complex number.

DONE.
