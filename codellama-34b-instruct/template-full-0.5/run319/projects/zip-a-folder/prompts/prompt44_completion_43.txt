  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `file` is a different method than `directory`, and it would not include the contents of the directory in the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the contents of the directory in the archive, whereas the original code did not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include the contents of the directory in the archive, whereas the original code did.

DONE.
