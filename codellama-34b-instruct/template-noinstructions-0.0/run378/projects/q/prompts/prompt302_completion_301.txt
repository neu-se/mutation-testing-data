  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x == y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a loose equality check instead of a strict equality check, which could lead to unexpected results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if x and y are not equal, instead of checking if they are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if x is greater than y, instead of checking if they are equal.

DONE.
