  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not add the new operation to the `ops` array, which would cause the `length` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not add the new operation to the `ops` array, which would cause the `length` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would add the new operation to the `ops` array at the end, which would cause the `length` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
