  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.unshift` will insert the element at the beginning of the array, whereas `nodeArgs.push` will insert it at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.pop` will remove and return the last element of the array, whereas `nodeArgs.push` will add an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.shift` will remove and return the first element of the array, whereas `nodeArgs.push` will add an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
