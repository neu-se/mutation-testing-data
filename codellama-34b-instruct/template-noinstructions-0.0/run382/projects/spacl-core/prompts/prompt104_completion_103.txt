  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.set` would always return `this`, which is the `PolicyMap` instance, whereas `this.get` would return the value associated with the given key in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.has` would always return `true` if the key is present in the map, whereas `this.get` would return the value associated with the given key in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.size` would always return the number of elements in the map, whereas `this.get` would return the value associated with the given key in the map.

DONE.
