  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|apex/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new word "apex" to the list of exceptions, which would not have the desired effect of ignoring the word "thesis".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/crisis|thesis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the words in the exception list, which could cause the regular expression to match differently depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/crisis|thesis|apex/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the word "apex" to the list of exceptions, which would not have the desired effect of ignoring the word "thesis".

DONE.
