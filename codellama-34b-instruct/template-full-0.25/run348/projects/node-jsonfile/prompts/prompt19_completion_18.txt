  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.toString()` returns the string representation of the `file` object, while `file` returns the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.name` returns the name of the file, while `file` returns the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.path` returns the path of the file, while `file` returns the object itself.

DONE.
