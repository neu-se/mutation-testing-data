  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(Op.length(thisOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was retaining the inserted text, while this code would delete it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp) + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was retaining the inserted text, while this code would retain one more character than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp), { bold: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was retaining the inserted text without any attributes, while this code would retain the text with the "bold" attribute set to true.

DONE.
