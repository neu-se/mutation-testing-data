  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(thisIter.nextIndex())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `ops` array starting from the next index after the current one, rather than starting from the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(thisIter.nextIndex() - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `ops` array starting from the index before the current one, rather than starting from the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(thisIter.nextIndex() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `ops` array starting from the index after the current one, rather than starting from the current index.

DONE.
