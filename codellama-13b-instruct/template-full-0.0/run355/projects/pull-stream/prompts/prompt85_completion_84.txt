  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || function () { throw new Error('Test error') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the `sink` function to throw an error, which would be caught by the `try` block in the `drain` function. This would cause the `drain` function to return an error, which would be passed to the `done` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || function () { return 'Test error' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the `sink` function to return a string, which would be passed to the `done` callback. This would cause the `drain` function to return a string, which would be passed to the `done` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || function () { console.log('Test error') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log` statement would cause
