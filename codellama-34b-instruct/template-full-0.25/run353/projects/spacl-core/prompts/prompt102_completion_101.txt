  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `ctx`, which could cause the `query` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `ctx` by 2, which could cause the `query` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the value of `ctx`, which could cause the `query` method to return a different result than expected.

DONE.
