  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.slice(1))
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `slice` method to extract a substring from the `part` variable, starting from the second character. This is a valid replacement, but it may not be the intended behavior, as it does not handle the case where the `part` variable contains a colon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
