  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the value is a finite number, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite. In this case, the code is checking if the value is infinite, so replacing it with `isFinite` would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
