  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` operator is used to return `undefined` in the original code, while `null` would return a null value instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` operator is used to return `undefined` in the original code, while `null` would return a null value instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` operator is used to return `undefined` in the original code, while `undefined` would return the undefined value directly.

DONE.
