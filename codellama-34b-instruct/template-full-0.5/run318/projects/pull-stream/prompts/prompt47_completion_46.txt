  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one additional time, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to never iterate, potentially causing the function to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate only once, potentially causing the function to return the wrong value.

DONE.
