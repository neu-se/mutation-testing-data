  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property is defined on the object, rather than checking if the object has an own property called `coordinates`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property is defined on the object, rather than checking if the object has an own property called `coordinates`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property is an array of length greater than 2, rather than checking if the object has an own property called `coordinates`.

DONE.
