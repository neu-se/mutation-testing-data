  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was ``initialValue``.
This change would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected value,
which is the result of applying the function to the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was ``initialValue``.
This change would cause the function to return the string `"string"` instead of the expected value,
which is the result of applying the function to the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was ``initialValue``.
This change would cause the function to return the number `42` instead of the expected value,
which is the result of applying the function to the input.

DONE.
