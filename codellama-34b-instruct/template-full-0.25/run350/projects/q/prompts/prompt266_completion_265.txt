  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `resolvedPromise` is not a boolean value, whereas the original code would return `false` only if `resolvedPromise` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `resolvedPromise` is not a boolean value, whereas the original code would return `false` only if `resolvedPromise` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `resolvedPromise` is not `undefined`, whereas the original code would return `false` only if `resolvedPromise` is `undefined`.

DONE.
