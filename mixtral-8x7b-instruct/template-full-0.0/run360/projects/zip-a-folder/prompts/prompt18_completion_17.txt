 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.F_OK` checks if the file exists, regardless of whether it's readable or writable, instead of checking if the file is readable (`fs.constants.R_OK`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.W_OK` checks if the file is writable, instead of checking if the file is readable (`fs.constants.R_OK`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.constants.R_OK + fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.X_OK` checks if the file is executable, which is not the same as checking if the file is readable (`fs.constants.R_OK`
