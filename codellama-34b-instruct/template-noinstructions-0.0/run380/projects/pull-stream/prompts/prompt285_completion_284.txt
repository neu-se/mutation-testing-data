  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with only one argument, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls the callback function with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with only one argument, while the new code fragment `cb(data)` calls the callback function with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with two arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(end, null)` calls the callback function with two arguments, but the second argument is always `null`.

DONE.
