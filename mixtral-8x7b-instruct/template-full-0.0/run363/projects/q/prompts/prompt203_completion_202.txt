 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"<@"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return -1, causing the `isNodeFrame` function to return false for any stack line containing "@".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"@module.js"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return 0, causing the `isNodeFrame` function to return true for any stack line starting with "@module.js".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"@" + (new Date()).getTime()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return -1, causing the `isNodeFrame` function to return false for any stack line containing the current timestamp instead of "@".

DONE.
