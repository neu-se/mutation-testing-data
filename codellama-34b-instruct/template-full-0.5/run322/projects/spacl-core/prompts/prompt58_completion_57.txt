  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the backslash, resulting in a different replacement string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not escape the backslash, resulting in a different replacement string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the backslash, resulting in a different replacement string.

DONE.
