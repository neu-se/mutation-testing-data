 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.apply([], promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Array.prototype.concat` and `Function.prototype.apply` to flatten the array, which may have unintended side effects or different performance characteristics compared to `array_map`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `promises` array using `Array.prototype.slice`, which may not behave the same way as `array_map` in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.map(function(promise) { return promise; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Array.prototype.map` with an identity function to create a new array, which may have different performance characteristics or behavior compared to `array_map`.

DONE.
