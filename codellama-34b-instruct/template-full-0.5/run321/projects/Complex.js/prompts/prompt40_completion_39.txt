  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the addition operator, while this replacement uses the subtraction operator. This would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the multiplication operator, while this replacement uses the addition operator. This would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b + b / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the multiplication operator, while this replacement uses the division operator. This would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
