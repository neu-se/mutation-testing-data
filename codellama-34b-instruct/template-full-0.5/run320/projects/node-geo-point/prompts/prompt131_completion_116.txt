  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method expects a number for the `zoom` parameter, but `1` is a string. This would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method expects a number for the `zoom` parameter, but `zoom + 1` is a string. This would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method expects a number for the `zoom` parameter, but `undefined` is not a number. This would cause the method to throw an error.

DONE.
