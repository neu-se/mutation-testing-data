  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.baseurl` may be different from `currentUrl.url` if the URL has a base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.protocol` may be different from `currentUrl.url` if the URL has a different protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.host` may be different from `currentUrl.url` if the URL has a different host.

DONE.
