  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"del"
```
This would result in different behavior because "del" is a different operation than "set" and would not modify the property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a different operation than "set" and would not modify the property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because "post" is a different operation than "set" and would not modify the property value.

DONE.
