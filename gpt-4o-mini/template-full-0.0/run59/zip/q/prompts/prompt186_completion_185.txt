Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at (.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the requirement for a column number, potentially matching more stack lines than intended, which could lead to incorrect file name and line number extraction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at (.+):(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional capturing group for the column number, which may cause the function to return `null` if the stack line does not include a column number, leading to missed matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at (.+):(\d+):(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it expects an additional capturing group for a fourth number, which is not standard in stack traces, causing the function to fail to match valid stack lines and return `null`.

DONE.
