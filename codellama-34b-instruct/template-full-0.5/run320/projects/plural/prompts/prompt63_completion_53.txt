  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'bacterium', which is the singular form of the word, while the new code fragment is 'bacteria', which is the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria' + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'bacterium', which is the singular form of the word, while the new code fragment is 'bacteriaa', which is the plural form with an extra 'a' at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'bacterium', which is the singular form of the word, while the new code fragment is 'bacterias', which is the plural form with an extra 's' at the end.

DONE.
