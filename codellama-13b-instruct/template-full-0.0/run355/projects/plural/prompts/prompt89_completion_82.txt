  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a variable reference. This could cause the test suite to fail if the test cases are not properly checking for the correct behavior when the input is a variable reference.
