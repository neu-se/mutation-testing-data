  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' && typeof thisOp.retain === 'object')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `otherOp.delete` being of type 'number' and `thisOp.retain` being of type 'number' or an object, while this solution only checks for `thisOp.retain` being an object without considering `otherOp.delete` type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' && otherIter.hasNext())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `thisOp.retain` being a number or an object, but this solution doesn't include that check and only focuses on the type of `otherOp.delete` and the presence of next items in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' && typeof someOtherVariable === '
