  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator is replaced with `===` which checks for strict equality. This would cause the function to return `true` if `value` is `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator is replaced with `==` which checks for loose equality. This would cause the function to return `true` if `value` is `null` or `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator is replaced with `!==` which checks for strict inequality. This would cause the function to return `true` if `value` is not `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
