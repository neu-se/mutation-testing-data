  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(callback.apply(thisp, arguments));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a node-style callback, which is then used to resolve the promise. In this option, the promise is resolved with the result of `callback.apply(thisp, arguments)`, which may not be a node-style callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(callback.apply(thisp, arguments).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a node-style callback, which is then used to resolve the promise. In this option, the promise is resolved with the result of `callback.apply(thisp, arguments)`, which may not be a node-style callback. Additionally, the `then` method is used to handle the resolution of the promise, which may not be necessary in the original code.
