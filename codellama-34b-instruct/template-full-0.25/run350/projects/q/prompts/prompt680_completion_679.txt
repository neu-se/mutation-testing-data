  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument of the function and use the second argument as the first argument for the `dispatch` method, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments of the function and use the third argument as the first argument for the `dispatch` method, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first three arguments of the function and use the fourth argument as the first argument for the `dispatch` method, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
