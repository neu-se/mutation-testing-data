  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method adds an operation to the end of the delta, whereas the original code fragment uses the `retain` method to add an operation to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method adds an operation to the delta, whereas the original code fragment uses the `push` method to add an operation to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method adds an operation to the delta, whereas the original code fragment uses the `push` method to add an operation to the delta.

DONE.
