  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method is used to retrieve the value of the `href` attribute of the `base` element, but the `base` element may not exist in the HTML document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` method is used to retrieve the value of the `href` property of the `base` element, which may not exist in the HTML document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href', 'https://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method is used to set the value of the `href` attribute of the `base` element to `https://example.com`, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
