 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` not only returns the deleted elements but also changes the original array, whereas `slice` returns a new array without modifying the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array without changing the original array, but it does not provide the desired functionality of returning the remaining operations starting from the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, but it does not provide the desired functionality of returning the remaining operations starting from the current index.

By introducing these changes, the test suite may not fail, indicating that the tests may not be effectively covering edge cases or the behavior of specific methods. Developers
