  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(/\n+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of lines, rather than a single string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(/\r?\n/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of lines, rather than a single string, and would also handle carriage returns in addition to line feeds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(/\n+/).filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of lines, remove any empty lines, and then return the resulting array.

DONE.
