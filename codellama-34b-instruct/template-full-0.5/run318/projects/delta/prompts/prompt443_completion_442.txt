  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a string that is one character longer than the original string, which could cause the `retain` operation to retain one more character than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a string that is one character shorter than the original string, which could cause the `retain` operation to retain one fewer character than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return an empty string, which could cause the `retain` operation to retain no characters at all.

DONE.
