  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with a specific `this` context, which would change the behavior of the `makeGenerator` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method calls a function with a specific `this` context and arguments, which would change the behavior of the `makeGenerator` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method calls a function with a specific `this` context and arguments, which would change the behavior of the `makeGenerator` function.

DONE.
