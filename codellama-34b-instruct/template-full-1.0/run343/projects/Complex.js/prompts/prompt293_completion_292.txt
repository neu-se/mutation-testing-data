  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sign(b) * Math.cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sign(b)` is incorrect and should be `Math.cosh(b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(b)` is incorrect and should be `Math.cos(b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos(b)` is incorrect and should be `Math.acos(a)`.

DONE.
