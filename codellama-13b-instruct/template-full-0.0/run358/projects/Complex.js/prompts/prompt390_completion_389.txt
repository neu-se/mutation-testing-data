  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` returns the value of the variable `a`, while `a + 1` returns the value of `a` plus one. This could potentially cause issues in the calculation of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` returns the value of the variable `a`, while `a - 1` returns the value of `a` minus one. This could potentially cause issues in the calculation of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` returns the value of the variable `a`, while `a * 2` returns the value of `a` multiplied by two. This could potentially cause issues in the calculation of the complex number.

DONE.
