Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the iterator to skip the next operation by advancing it by two instead of one, potentially missing an operation that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(0)` effectively does nothing and does not advance the iterator, which means the same operation will be processed repeatedly, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, which means the same operation will be evaluated multiple times without moving forward, potentially causing an infinite loop or incorrect processing of operations.

DONE.
