 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'#' + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a random fragment identifier to the URL, which changes the URL without affecting the rest of the code's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'#some-fragment'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a static fragment identifier to the URL, which changes the URL without affecting the rest of the code's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'?foo=bar'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a query parameter to the URL, which changes the URL without affecting the rest of the code's behavior.

These changes introduce different behavior by modifying the URL in ways that the original code fragment does not. By doing so, they can help reveal potential weaknesses in the test suite's ability to handle variations in URL formats. DONE.
