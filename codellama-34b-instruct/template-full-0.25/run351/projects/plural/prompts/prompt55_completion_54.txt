  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is called with the `regex` variable as the first argument, which is not the same as the `regex` variable in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
