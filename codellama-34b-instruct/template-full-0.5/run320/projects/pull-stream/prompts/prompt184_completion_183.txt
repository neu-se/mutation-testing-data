  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` as the second argument, regardless of the value of `array[i++]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i++], null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the current value of `array[i++]` as the first argument, regardless of whether it is `null` or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the current value of `array[i++]` as the second argument, regardless of whether it is `null` or not.

DONE.
