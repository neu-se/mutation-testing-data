  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word would have an extra "s" at the end. For example, "nucleus" would become "nucleiis" instead of "nuclei".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word would have an extra "us" at the end. For example, "syllabus" would become "syllabuss" instead of "syllabi".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'um' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting word would have an extra "um" at the end
