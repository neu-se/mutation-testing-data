  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `index` variable to access the current element of the array, while the modified code fragment uses `index + 1` to access the next element of the array. This would cause the `array_reduce` function to skip over the first element of the array and process the remaining elements in the array.
