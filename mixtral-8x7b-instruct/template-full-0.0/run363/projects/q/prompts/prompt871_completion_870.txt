 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is passed as `args` instead of the actual arguments array, which could cause the callback function to behave differently or throw an error due to incorrect arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is passed instead of the arguments array, which could cause the callback function to behave differently or throw an error due to incorrect arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
