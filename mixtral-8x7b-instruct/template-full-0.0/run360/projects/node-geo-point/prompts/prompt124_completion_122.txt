 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
<GeoPoint>[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method expects a single `GeoPoint` object, but it would receive an array of `GeoPoint` objects instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method expects a non-null `GeoPoint` object, but it would receive `null` instead, causing a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{ latitude: 0, longitude: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method expects a `GeoPoint` object, but it would receive a plain object with latitude and longitude properties instead. This might not cause a runtime error, but the result would be incorrect.

DONE.
