  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude) - deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference between the two longitudes in radians, which would give a different result than the original code that calculated the difference between the two longitudes in degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(point1.longitude) - rad2deg(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference between the two longitudes in degrees, which would give a different result than the original code that calculated the difference between the two longitudes in radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI * (point1.longitude - point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference between the two longitudes in radians, but would multiply it by pi, which would give a different result than the original
