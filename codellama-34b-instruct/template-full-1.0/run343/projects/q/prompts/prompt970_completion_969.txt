  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operation would output a different value than the original name variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "Hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string concatenation operation would append the word "Hello" to the original name variable, changing its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the toUpperCase() method would capitalize the original name variable, changing its value.
