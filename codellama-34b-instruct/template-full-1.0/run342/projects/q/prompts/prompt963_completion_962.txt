  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.unshift(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.unshift` is a method used to add elements to the beginning of an array. By using the argument -1, the function will insert the value -1 at the beginning of the `args` array, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.pop` is a method used to remove an element from the end of an array. By using `args.pop()`, the function will remove the last element of the `args` array, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `.concat` is a method used to concatenate two arrays. By using `args.concat([])`, the function will create a new array by concatenating `args` with an empty array. This will not affect the behavior of
