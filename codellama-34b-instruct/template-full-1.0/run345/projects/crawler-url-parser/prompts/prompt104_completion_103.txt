  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text === text
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the text property of the tmpUrl object to be set to the value of the text variable, which is not the intended behavior of the original `includes` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text = text
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the text property of the tmpUrl object to the value of the text variable, which is not the intended behavior of the original `includes` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text >> text
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of the text property of the tmpUrl object is greater than the value of the text variable. It is not the intended behavior of the original `includes` method.
DONE.
