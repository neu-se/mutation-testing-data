  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the RegEx match would not match the same character as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/gi, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the RegEx match would match in a case-insensitive manner, and the replacement would be done globally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\bmar\b/i, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the RegEx match would only occur on whole words, and the match would be case-insensitive.

DONE.
