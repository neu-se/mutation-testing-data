Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `otherIter` to skip one operation, potentially leading to an incomplete composition of operations in the resulting `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve the rest of the operations starting from index 0, which may not correctly represent the remaining operations after the current index, leading to incorrect results in the final `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest(thisIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the rest of the operations starting from the length of the current operation, which could lead to an incorrect composition of operations if the current operation is not the last one, potentially omitting necessary operations.

DONE.
