 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parse(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the 're' and 'im' properties to 0, whereas the original code might use different default values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parse(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes null values, which might cause unexpected behavior in the `parse` function, whereas the original code passes `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parse(this.re, this.im)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the current object's 're' and 'im' properties, whereas the original code might use different values. This could lead to incorrect initialization of the Complex object.

DONE.
