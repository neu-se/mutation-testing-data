  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(void 0, function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the actual error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function(){}, function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an empty function instead of the actual error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an empty function instead of the actual error, and the rejection would be handled by the `onRejected` callback.

DONE.
