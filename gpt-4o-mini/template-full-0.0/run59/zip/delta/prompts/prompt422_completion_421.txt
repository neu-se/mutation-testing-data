Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly subtracts the length of the current operation instead of the offset, potentially leading to an incorrect index calculation when there are multiple operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the offset to the index instead of subtracting it, which would cause the index to move in the wrong direction, leading to incorrect position transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the index by 2, which would drastically change the index value, causing incorrect transformations and potentially leading to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect data handling.

DONE.
