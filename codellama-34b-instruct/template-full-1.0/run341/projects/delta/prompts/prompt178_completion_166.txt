  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` property of the `otherOp` object to be mistakenly treated as the `retain` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property of the `otherOp` object to be mistakenly treated as the `delete` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` property of the `otherOp` object to be mistakenly treated as the `retain` property.

DONE.
