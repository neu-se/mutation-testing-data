Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call(thisp, args[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the function with a specified `this` value and only the first argument from `args`, ignoring any additional arguments, which changes how the function is executed compared to `apply`, which passes all arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]();
```
This would result in different behavior because this code attempts to call the method `name` on `value` without passing any arguments, which could lead to unexpected results if `name` requires parameters, unlike `apply` which passes all arguments from `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].bind(thisp)();
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value (`thisp`), but it does not pass any arguments from `args`, which is different from `apply` that passes all arguments as an array.

DONE.
