  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw e;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the error synchronously, while this replacement throws it asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(e);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the error with no message, while this replacement throws it with a message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw e.message;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the error with the error object, while this replacement throws the error message.

DONE.
