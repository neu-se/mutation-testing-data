  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra iteration, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not run at all, potentially causing the function to return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index == length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run only once, potentially causing the function to return an array with only one element.

DONE.
