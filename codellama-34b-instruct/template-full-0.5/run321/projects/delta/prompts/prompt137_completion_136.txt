  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `firstOther.attributes` is `null`, while this code fragment checks if it's not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `firstOther.attributes` is `null`, while this code fragment checks if it's not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `firstOther.attributes` is `null`, while this code fragment checks if it's
