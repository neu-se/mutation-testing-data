  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value of the `head` property instead of the value of the `tail` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail" + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value of the `tail` property plus the string "1" instead of the value of the `tail` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail" - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value of the `tail` property minus 1 instead of the value of the `tail` property.

DONE.
