  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.push(tz.r);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of `tz.r` to the `current` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code pushes the `id` to the `current` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.push(aliasTz.r);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of `aliasTz.r` to the `current` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code pushes the `id` to the `current` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.push(result[country].all[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the first element of the `all` array to the `current` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code
