  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with '{}'.
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a literal value while the mutated value is an expression that evaluates to an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with 'undefined'.
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a literal value while the mutated value is a falsy value that would not trigger the JSON.parse() function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with 'Promise.resolve(data, options ? options.reviver : null)'.
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a literal value while the mutated value is a promise that would be resolved with the data and reviver values.

Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants, referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.
