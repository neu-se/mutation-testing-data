  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toLocaleString
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLocaleString` method is not called on the same object as the `toString` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var toString = Object.prototype.toString; toString.call(obj);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not called directly on the object, but rather through a variable that stores the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj, "custom");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is called with a custom radix instead of the default radix of 10.

DONE.
