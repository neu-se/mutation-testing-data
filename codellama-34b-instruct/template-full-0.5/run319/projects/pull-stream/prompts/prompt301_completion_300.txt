  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the value of `end`, causing the `ended` variable to be set to the opposite of its original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would increment the value of `end` by 1, causing the `ended` variable to be set to a different value than its original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable would be set to `true` regardless of the value of `end`, causing the `read` function to be called with `ended` set to `true` even if `end` is `false`.

DONE.
