  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.includes(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if an element is present in an array, while the original code fragment checks if the callback is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property returns the number of elements in an array, while the original code fragment checks if the callback is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks the type of a variable, while the original code fragment checks if the callback is a function.

DONE.
