  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace `http://` or `https://` with `http://`, which could cause issues if the URL being parsed is an HTTPS URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace `http://` or `https://` with `https://`, which could cause issues if the URL being parsed is an HTTP URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace `http://` or `https://` with `ftp://`, which could cause issues if the URL being parsed is an HTTP or HTTPS URL.

DONE.
