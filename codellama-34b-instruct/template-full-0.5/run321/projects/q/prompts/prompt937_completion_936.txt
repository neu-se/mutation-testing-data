  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with one argument instead of two.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with three arguments instead of two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the string "foo" as the second argument instead of a number.

DONE.
