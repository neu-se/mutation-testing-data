  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that signals the end of the data to be written, whereas `destroy()` is a method that destroys the stream, making it no longer usable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` is a method that writes data to the stream, whereas `end()` and `destroy()` are methods that signal the end of the data to be written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.write('', () => this._writeStream.end())
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` is a method that writes data to the stream, and the callback function passed to `write()` is called when the data has been written. In this case, the callback function calls `end()` to signal the end of the data to be
