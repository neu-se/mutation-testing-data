  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some/path/to/file.txt"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the output file path relative to the target base path, but the replaced code sets an absolute path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + ".zip"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the file extension based on the desired archive format, but the replaced code always sets the ".zip" extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some/folder/" + targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the output file path relative to the target base path, but the replaced code sets it relative to a different folder.

DONE.
