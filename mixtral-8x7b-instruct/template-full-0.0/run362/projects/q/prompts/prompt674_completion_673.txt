 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value set to the provided value, which in this case is the same as the original code. However, the new function doesn't take any arguments, so the arguments passed to the function will be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the function with the provided `this` value and arguments provided individually. In this case, the `this` value is set to `null`, which is different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.apply(this, [])
