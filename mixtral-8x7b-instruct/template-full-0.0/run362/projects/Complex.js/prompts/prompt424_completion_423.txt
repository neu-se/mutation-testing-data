 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when the complex number's real part is zero, whereas the original code would return Complex.INFINITY.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] > 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return Complex.ZERO when the real part of the complex number is greater than 1000, whereas the original code would return Complex.ZERO only when the complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return Complex.ZERO when the complex number is NaN, whereas the original code would throw an error.

Note: The above code fragments assume that the 'isInfinite' and 'isNaN' methods are not defined for the Complex class. If they are defined, the behavior would be different
