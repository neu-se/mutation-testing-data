  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the resolved promise, which might cause unexpected side effects or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to the resolved promise, which could change the behavior of the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that rejects with the resolved promise, which could change the behavior of the application.

DONE.
