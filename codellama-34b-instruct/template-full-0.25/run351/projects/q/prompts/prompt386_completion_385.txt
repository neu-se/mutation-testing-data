  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` is a method that applies the function to the arguments as an array, whereas `fcall` applies the function to the arguments as a list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `fbind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, and `fcall` does not have this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fbind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fbind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, and passing `null` as the value would result in a different `this` value than the original code.

DONE.
