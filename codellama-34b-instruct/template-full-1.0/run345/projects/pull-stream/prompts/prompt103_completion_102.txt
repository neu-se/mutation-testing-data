  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the `data` argument as is, while this change adds 1 to the `data` argument before logging it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the `data` argument directly, while this change converts the `data` argument to a string before logging it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the `data` argument directly, while this change converts the `data` argument to uppercase before logging it.

DONE.
