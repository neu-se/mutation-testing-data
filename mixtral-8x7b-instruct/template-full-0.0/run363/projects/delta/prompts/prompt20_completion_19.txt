 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(<any>b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it may cause a runtime error when `b` is not an object. The original code assumes `b` to be an object, but this change would perform type assertion, potentially causing issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an object even when `b` is `null` or `undefined`. The original code returns `undefined` when `b` is not provided or is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(b))
