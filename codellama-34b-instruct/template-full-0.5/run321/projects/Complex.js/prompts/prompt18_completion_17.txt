  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.abs` have different functions. `Math.sin` calculates the sine of a number, while `Math.abs` calculates the absolute value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` and `Math.abs` have different mathematical properties. `a + b` calculates the sum of two numbers, while `Math.abs` calculates the absolute value of a single number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max(a, b)` and `Math.abs` have different mathematical properties. `Math.max(a, b)` calculates the maximum of two numbers, while `Math.abs` calculates the absolute value of a single number.

DONE.
