  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the key and value being passed to the `forEach` loop, potentially causing the loop to skip some or all of the entries in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the key and value being passed to the `forEach` loop, potentially causing the loop to iterate over additional entries in the database that were not intended to be included.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val, key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the order of the key and value being passed to the `forEach` loop, potentially causing the loop to access the incorrect values in the database.

DONE.
