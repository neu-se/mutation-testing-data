 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'=='
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the equality comparison to an abstract equality comparison, which may not behave as expected for all input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'!=='
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the equality comparison to an strict inequality comparison, which may not behave as expected for all input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'>'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the equality comparison to a greater than comparison, which would always return false for the current implementation.

DONE.
