  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, rather than the original value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, rather than the original value of the promise, and it would also cause the promise to be rejected with the value `undefined`, rather than the original reason for rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, rather than the original value of the promise, and it would also cause the promise to be rejected
