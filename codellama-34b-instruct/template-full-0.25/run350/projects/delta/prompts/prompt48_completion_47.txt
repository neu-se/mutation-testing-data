  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `embedType` is not equal to the first key in the `b` object, regardless of whether `embedType` is actually a key in the `b` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).includes(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `embedType` is a key in the `b` object, regardless of whether it is the first key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)[0] === embedType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `embedType` is the first key in the `b` object, regardless of whether it is a key at all.

DONE.
