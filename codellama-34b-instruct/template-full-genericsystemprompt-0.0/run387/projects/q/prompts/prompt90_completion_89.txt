  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is bound to the given function's context. In this case, `uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)` would return a new function that is bound to the context of `Array.prototype.slice`, which would cause the `slice` method to be called on the `Array.prototype` object instead of the `array_slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.reduce)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is bound to the given function's context. In this case, `uncurryThis(Array.prototype.reduce)` would return a new function that is bound to the context of `Array.prototype.reduce`, which would cause the `reduce
