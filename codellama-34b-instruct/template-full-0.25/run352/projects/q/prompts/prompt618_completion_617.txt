  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of `key + 1` as the second argument to `dispatch`, instead of the value of `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of `key - 1` as the second argument to `dispatch`, instead of the value of `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of `key * 2` as the second argument to `dispatch`, instead of the value of `key`.

DONE.
