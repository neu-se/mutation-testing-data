  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the value is a promise, but if it's replaced with null, it will not be considered a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the value is a promise, but if it's replaced with undefined, it will not be considered a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the value is a promise, but if it's replaced with 0, it will not be considered a promise.

DONE.
