  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` would remove all elements from the queue, whereas `delete` would only remove the element at the specified key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` would remove the last element from the queue, whereas `delete` would only remove the element at the specified key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` would remove the first element from the queue, whereas `delete` would only remove the element at the specified key.

DONE.
