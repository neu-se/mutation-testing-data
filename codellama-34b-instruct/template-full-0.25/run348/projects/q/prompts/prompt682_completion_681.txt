  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply` method on the `Q` object with the `object` and `arguments` as arguments, instead of calling the `dispatch` method on the `Q` object with the `object` and `arguments` as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply` method on the `Q` object with the `object` and `arguments` as arguments, but it would skip the first argument of the `arguments` array, which could cause the method to be called with the wrong arguments.
