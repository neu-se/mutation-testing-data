 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for inequality instead of equality, and it also checks for a string type, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for inequality with the number type, which is different from the original code that checks for equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' && typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the type of `lastOp.insert` instead of `lastOp.retain`, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
