  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path + "/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the path name without the trailing slash, while the modified code fragment includes the trailing slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path + "?"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the path name without the query string, while the modified code fragment includes the query string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path + "#"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the path name without the fragment identifier, while the modified code fragment includes the fragment identifier.

DONE.
