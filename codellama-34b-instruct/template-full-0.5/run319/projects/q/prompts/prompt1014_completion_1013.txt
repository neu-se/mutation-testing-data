  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method is not called, which means that the promise will not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method is called with an undefined argument, which may cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is called on the result of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which may cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently.

DONE.
