  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp` is an object with properties `insert`, `retain`, and `delete`, and `nextOp.insert` would only refer to the `insert` property of the object, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp` is an object with properties `insert`, `retain`, and `delete`, and `nextOp.retain` would only refer to the `retain` property of the object, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp` is an object with properties `insert`, `retain`, and `delete`, and `nextOp.delete` would only refer to the `delete` property of the object, which may not be the desired behavior.
