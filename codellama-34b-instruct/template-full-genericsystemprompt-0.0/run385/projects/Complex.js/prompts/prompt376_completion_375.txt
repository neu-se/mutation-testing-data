  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square of the imaginary part instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary parts instead of multiplying them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the imaginary part from the real part instead of multiplying them.

DONE.
