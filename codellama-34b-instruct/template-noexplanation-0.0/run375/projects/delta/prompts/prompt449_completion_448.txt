  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'number'
```
This change will cause the `peekType` method to return `'retain'` instead of `'delete'` when the `op.delete` property is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This change will cause the `peekType` method to return `'retain'` instead of `'delete'` when the `op.delete` property is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'object'
```
This change will cause the `peekType` method to return `'retain'` instead of `'delete'` when the `op.delete` property is an object.

DONE.
