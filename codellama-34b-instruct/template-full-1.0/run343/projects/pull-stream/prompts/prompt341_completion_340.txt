  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks if two values are not equal, whereas the original code fragment uses the `in` operator to check if a property exists in an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is setting the value of the `seen` property to `true`, whereas this replacement code is setting the value of the `seen` property to `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = !!invert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is setting the value of the `seen` property to the boolean negation of the value of the `invert` property, whereas this replacement code is setting the value of the `
