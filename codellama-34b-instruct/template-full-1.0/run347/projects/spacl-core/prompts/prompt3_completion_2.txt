  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` makes the quantifier optional, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]{2,}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the quantifier `{2,}` forces at least 2 matches, which goes against the original intention of the pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]|[0-9]{5}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the pipe `|` separates two different matches, which goes against the original intention of the pattern.

DONE.
