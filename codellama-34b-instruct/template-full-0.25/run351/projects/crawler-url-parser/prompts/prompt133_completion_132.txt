  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` character to indicate the end of a URL path, while the new code fragment uses the `\` character, which is an escape character in JavaScript. This could cause the URL parsing logic to behave differently and potentially return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` character to indicate the end of a URL path, while the new code fragment uses the `?` character, which is a query string separator in URLs. This could cause the URL parsing logic to behave differently and potentially return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` character to indicate the end of a URL path, while the new code fragment uses the `#` character, which is a fragment identifier separator in URLs. This could cause the URL parsing logic
