  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key, rather than the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key that is one more than the input key, rather than the input key itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + '1')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key that is the input key concatenated with the string '1', rather than the input key itself.

DONE.
