  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a".length
```
This would result in different behavior because `"a".length` is always 1, whereas `opLength` would be the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 100
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random() * 100` would return a random number between 0 and 100, whereas `opLength` would be the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be a falsy value, whereas `opLength` would be a truthy value.

DONE.
