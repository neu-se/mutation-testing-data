 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the '1' is being added to the imaginary part of the complex number regardless of the value of `tokens[i + 1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number is being added to the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the intended value from `tokens[i + 1]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the current complex number's imaginary part is being added instead of the intended value from `tokens[i + 1]`.

DONE.
