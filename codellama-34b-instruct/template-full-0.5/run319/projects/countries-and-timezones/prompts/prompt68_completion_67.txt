  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the `id` property of the `country` object is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
