  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `c + 1` is not equal to `c`, which is the original code fragment. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `c - 1` is not equal to `c`, which is the original code fragment. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `c * 2` is not equal to `c`, which is the original code fragment. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`,
