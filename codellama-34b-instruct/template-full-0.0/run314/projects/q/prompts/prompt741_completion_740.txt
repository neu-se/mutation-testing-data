  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject(err)` to reject the promise with the error object, while this option uses `deferred.reject(rejection)` to reject the promise with the rejection object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.resolve(promises)` to resolve the promise with the array of promises, while this option uses `deferred.resolve(promises)` to resolve the promise with the array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify({ index: index, value: progress });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.notify({ index: index, value: progress })` to notify the progress of the promise, while this option uses `deferred.notify
