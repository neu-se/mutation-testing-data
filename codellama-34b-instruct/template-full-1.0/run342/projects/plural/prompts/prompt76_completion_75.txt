  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer include the final 'e' in the word "die".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'diez'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would add an 'es' to the end of the word "diez", which is not a valid English word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'diex'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would add an 'es' to the end of the word "diex", which is not a valid English word.

DONE.
