  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the negation of the `isObject` function, which returns `true` if the input is an object and `false` otherwise. Replacing it with `isObject` without the negation would result in the opposite behavior, where the test would pass if the input is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the input is not an object, while this new code fragment checks if the input is falsy, which includes `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN`, and empty strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the input is an object and has a property `type` that is not `null` or `undefined`, while this new code fragment
