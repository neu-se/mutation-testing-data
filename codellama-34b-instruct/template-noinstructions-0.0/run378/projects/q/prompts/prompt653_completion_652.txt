  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the second argument instead of the third, which would cause the `args` array to be one element shorter than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the third argument instead of the second, which would cause the `args` array to be two elements shorter than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the fourth argument instead of the second, which would cause the `args` array to be three elements shorter than expected.

DONE.
