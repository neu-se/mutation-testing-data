  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter((policy) => policy.name === name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.filter()` method returns a new array with only the policies that match the given name, whereas the original code fragment returned all policies regardless of their name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice(0, name.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.slice()` method returns a new array with only the first `name.length` policies, whereas the original code fragment returned all policies regardless of their position in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.concat(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.concat()` method returns a new array with the `name` variable appended to the end of the `policies` array, whereas the original code fragment did not modify the `policies` array.

DONE.
