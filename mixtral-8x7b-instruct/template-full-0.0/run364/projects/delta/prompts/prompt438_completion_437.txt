 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
nextOp.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `Op` instance with a truthy `retain` property (e.g., an object or non-empty string) as a match, while the original condition checks if `retain` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match `Op` instances with a string `retain` property, whereas the original condition checks for a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
nextOp.hasOwnProperty('retain')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any `Op` instance with a `retain` property, regardless of its type, while the original condition checks if `retain` is a number.

DONE.
