  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition `i > lines.length` would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < lines.length - 1; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last element in the `lines` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < lines.length; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, and would never terminate as `i` would never reach a value greater than `lines.length`.

DONE.
