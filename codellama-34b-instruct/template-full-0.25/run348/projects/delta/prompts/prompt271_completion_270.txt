  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `iter` has a next element, while this modified code fragment checks if both `iter` and `otherIter` have a next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!iter.hasNext() || otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `iter` has a next element, while this modified code fragment checks if `iter` does not have a next element or if `otherIter` has a next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() || otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `iter` has a next element, while this modified code fragment checks if `iter` has a next element or if `otherIter` has a next element.

DONE.
