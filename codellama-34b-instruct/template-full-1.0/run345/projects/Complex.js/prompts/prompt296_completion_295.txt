  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the tangent function, which uses the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which changes the calculation of the tangent function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*b
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which changes the calculation of the tangent function.

DONE.
