  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error or unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length; index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, potentially causing an error or unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index == length; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate once, potentially causing an error or unexpected result.

DONE.
