  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$` character to indicate the end of the string, while the new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc + '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `$` character at the end of the string, while the new code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc + '$$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `$$` characters at the end of the string, while the new code fragment does.

DONE.
