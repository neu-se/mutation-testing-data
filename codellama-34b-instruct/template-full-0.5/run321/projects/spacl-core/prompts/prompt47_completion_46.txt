  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` wildcard matches zero or more characters, whereas the `+` wildcard matches one or more characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.?/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` wildcard matches zero or one character, whereas the `+` wildcard matches one or more characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.{1,}/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{1,}` quantifier matches one or more characters, whereas the `+` wildcard matches one or more characters.

DONE.
