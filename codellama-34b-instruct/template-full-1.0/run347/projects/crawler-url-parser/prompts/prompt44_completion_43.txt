  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `parse` would not try to parse the URL if the `baseUrl` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `parse` would throw an error if the `baseUrl` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `parse` would throw an error if the `baseUrl` is undefined.

DONE.
