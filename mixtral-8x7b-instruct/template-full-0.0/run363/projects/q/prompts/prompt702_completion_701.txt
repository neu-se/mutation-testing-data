 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.callee
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the current function, which can cause issues in strict mode and is generally considered bad practice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass the correct arguments to the `array_slice` function, causing unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass a resolved promise instead of the actual arguments, causing unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
