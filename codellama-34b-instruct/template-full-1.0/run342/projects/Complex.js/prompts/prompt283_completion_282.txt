  Sure, here are three different code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator changes the sign of the result, so the `cos` function would return the opposite of what it would have returned if the `-` operator were not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function returns the sine of the argument, while the `cos` function returns the cosine. So the result of the `sin` function would be different from the result of the `cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Using `Math.PI` in place of the `cos` function would cause the program to perform a different calculation
