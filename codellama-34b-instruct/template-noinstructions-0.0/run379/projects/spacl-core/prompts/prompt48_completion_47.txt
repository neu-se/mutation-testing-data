  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire part string to the props array, instead of just the part after the colon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1).replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, ''))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a modified version of the part string to the props array, where all non-alphanumeric characters have been removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1).toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a lowercase version of the part string to the props array.

DONE.
