  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, 'notdata'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for `null`, but this replacement checks for `undefined` instead, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input data contains `undefined` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, 'default data'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not providing a default value for the data, so if the input data is `null`, the code would return `null` instead of `'default data'`, which could cause incorrect behavior in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'notnull', data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for `null`, but this replacement checks for a string value instead, which could cause incorrect behavior if the input data is not a string.
