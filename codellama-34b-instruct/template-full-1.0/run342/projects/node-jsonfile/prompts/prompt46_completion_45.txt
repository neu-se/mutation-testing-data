  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.wrteFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a typo of `fs.writeFileSync`, and the code would not compile as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)` has three parameters, while the new code fragment `fs.writeFileSync(file, str)` has only two parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str + 'invalid')
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment appends the string `'invalid'` to the end of the `str` variable, which would cause the file to be written with different contents.

Done.
