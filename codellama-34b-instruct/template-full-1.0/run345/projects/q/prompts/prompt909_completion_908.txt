  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the test suite would pass, despite the fact that the code still contains a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the test suite would fail, due to the fact that the function returns null instead of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the test suite would fail, due to the fact that the function returns undefined instead of a promise.

DONE.
