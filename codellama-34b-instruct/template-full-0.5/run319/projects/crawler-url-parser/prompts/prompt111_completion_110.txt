  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, but the modified code fragment is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, but the modified code fragment is a different string with all letters in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, but the modified code fragment is an array of strings.

DONE.
