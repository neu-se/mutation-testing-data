  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it returns the last portion of the path, rather than the extension. This could cause the code to fail if the file name does not have an extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This code fragment returns the directory name of the path, rather than the file name. This could cause the code to fail if the file name is not in the current directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(path.dirname(options.dest), path.basename(options.dest))
```
This code fragment joins the directory name and file name of the path, rather than just the file name. This could cause the code to fail if the file name is not in the current directory.

DONE.
