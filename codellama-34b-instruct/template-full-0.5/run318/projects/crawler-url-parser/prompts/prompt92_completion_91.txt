  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only removes the protocol from the URL if it is present at the beginning of the string, whereas this modified code fragment removes the protocol regardless of its position in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/\/.*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only removes the path and query string from the URL, whereas this modified code fragment removes everything after the first slash in the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/(^https?:\/\/)|(\/.*$)/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only removes the protocol and path/query string from the URL, whereas this modified code fragment removes both the protocol and the path/query string using a regular expression with the `g` flag to match all occurrences.
