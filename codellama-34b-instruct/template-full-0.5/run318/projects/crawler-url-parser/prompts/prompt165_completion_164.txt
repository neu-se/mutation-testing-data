  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/^\//, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method with a regular expression would remove any leading forward slashes from the `pageurl_path` string, which could cause the `includes` method to return `false` even if the substring is present in the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would remove the first character of the `pageurl_path` string, which could cause the `includes` method to return `false` even if the substring is present in the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return the substring of the `pageurl_path` string starting from the second character, which could cause the `includes` method to return `false` even
