  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the same word without the last character, instead of the word without the last two characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the word with the last character removed, instead of the word without the last two characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the word with the last three characters removed, instead of the word without the last two characters.

DONE.
