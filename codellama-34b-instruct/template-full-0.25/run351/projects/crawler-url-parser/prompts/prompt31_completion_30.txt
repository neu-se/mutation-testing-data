  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)|^\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match URLs that start with "//" instead of just "http://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)|^\/\/(?!\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match URLs that start with "//" followed by a non-slash character instead of just "http://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)|^\/\/(?!\/)|^\/\/(?=\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match URLs that start with "//" followed by a non-slash character or "//" followed by a slash character.

DONE.
