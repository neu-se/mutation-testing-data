  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse`, which could cause the parsed data to be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver, options.encoding)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is not being passed to `JSON.parse`, which could cause the parsed data to be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver, options.encoding, options.bom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bom` option is not being passed to `JSON.parse`, which could cause the parsed data to be different from the original.

DONE.
