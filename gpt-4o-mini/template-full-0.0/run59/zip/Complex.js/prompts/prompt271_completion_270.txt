Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the arctangent of `b` instead of the arctangent of the ratio of `b` to `a`, which can lead to incorrect angle values, especially when `a` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the arguments of `Math.atan2`, which means it will compute the angle based on the real part as the first argument and the imaginary part as the second, leading to incorrect angle calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the calculation of the angle with a constant value of Ï€/2, which does not depend on the actual values of `a` and `b`, thus always returning the same angle regardless of the input.

DONE.
