  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `universalify.fromCallback` function is not called with the `fs.readFile` function as its argument, but rather with the result of calling `fs.readFile` with the `file` and `options` arguments. This would cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to be called with a different function than the original code, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.readFile` function is called directly, rather than being passed as an argument to the `universalify.fromCallback` function. This could result in different behavior if the `fs.readFile` function has different behavior than the `universalify.fromCallback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.read
