 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of the promises array instead of checking if all promises have been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pendingCount > 0
