 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method does not handle `null` arguments, and will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects an array of arguments, not an empty array. This may cause unexpected behavior or errors in the method, depending on its implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ foo: 'bar' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects an array of arguments, not an object. This may cause unexpected behavior or errors in the method, depending on its implementation.

DONE.
