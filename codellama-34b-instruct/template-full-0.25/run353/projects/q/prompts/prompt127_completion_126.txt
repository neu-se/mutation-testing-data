  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator increments the value of `key` by 1, which could potentially cause the `for` loop to skip over certain elements in the `object` if the keys are not consecutive integers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator adds 1 to the value of `key`, which could potentially cause the `for` loop to iterate over the same element multiple times if the keys are not consecutive integers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator subtracts 1 from the value of `key`, which could potentially cause the `for` loop to skip over the first element in the `object` if the keys are not consecutive integers.

DONE.
