Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the sine of `b` instead of the cosine, leading to incorrect results for the real part of the complex exponentiation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the tangent of `b`, which is not appropriate for the calculation of the complex exponent, resulting in incorrect values for the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b + Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively compute the cosine of `b` shifted by Ï€, which would invert the sign of the cosine value, leading to incorrect results for the real part of the complex exponentiation.

DONE.
