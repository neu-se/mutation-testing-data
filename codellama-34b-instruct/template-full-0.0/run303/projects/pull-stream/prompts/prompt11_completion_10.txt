  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially missing the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last index of the array instead of the first, potentially causing the loop to execute fewer times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the length of the array instead of the first index, potentially causing the loop to execute zero times.

DONE.
