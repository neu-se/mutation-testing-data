 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.round(this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds the longitude value to the nearest integer, which may not be the desired behavior when adjusting precision.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.longitude * precision
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the longitude value by the precision value, instead of adjusting the precision of the longitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.altitude || this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `altitude` property if it exists, and falls back to `longitude` otherwise. This is incorrect because the original code does not use `altitude` in the `adjustPrecision` method.

DONE.
