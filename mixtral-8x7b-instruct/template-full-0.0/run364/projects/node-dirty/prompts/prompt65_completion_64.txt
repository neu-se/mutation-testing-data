 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this._writeStream = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately sets the `_writeStream` property to `null`, preventing any further write operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this._writeStream.end(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends a false value to the `end` method, which might cause issues if the `end` method expects a specific data type or value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this._writeStream.destroySync()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroySync` is not a valid method for the `_writeStream` object, and it would throw a `TypeError` if called.

DONE.
