  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(123);
```
This would result in different behavior because the correct argument for `finalize` is a callback function, which the code above provides instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(() => console.log('DONE!'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function provided above logs a message to the console, while the expected callback function does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize((err, res) => res ? console.log('DONE!') : console.log('ERROR'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function provided above logs a message to the console based on the result of the `finalize` method, while the expected callback function does not.

DONE.
