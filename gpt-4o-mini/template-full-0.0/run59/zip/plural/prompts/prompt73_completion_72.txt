Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'celli'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "cello" is incorrectly changed to "celli" instead of the correct "cellos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'celloes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "cello" is incorrectly changed to "celloes", which is not a standard pluralization for this word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'cellosies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "cello" is incorrectly changed to "cellosies", which is not a valid pluralization and introduces an unnecessary suffix.

DONE.
