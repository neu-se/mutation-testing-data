  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `defer` function with `null` as the first argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `defer` function with `undefined` as the first argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(void 0, void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `defer` function with `void 0` as the first argument, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
