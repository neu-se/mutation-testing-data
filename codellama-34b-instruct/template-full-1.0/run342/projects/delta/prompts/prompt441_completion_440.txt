  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a `string` type, not an object with a `substr` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.toLowerCase
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a `string` type, so using `toLowerCase` would change the case of the `insert` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert. concat('123')
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a `string` type, so concatenating a new string would change the value of `insert`.

DONE.
