  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1 < length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate once, regardless of the length of the array.

DONE.
