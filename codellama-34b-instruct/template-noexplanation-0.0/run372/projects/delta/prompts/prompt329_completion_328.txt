  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes && true
```
This code fragment is a valid replacement for the original code fragment, but it has a different behavior. The `&& true` part of the code fragment ensures that the `op.attributes` property is always truthy, even if it is `null` or `undefined`. This can cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to behave differently than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes && false
```
This code fragment is also a valid replacement for the original code fragment, but it has a different behavior. The `&& false` part of the code fragment ensures that the `op.attributes` property is always falsy, even if it is `null` or `undefined`. This can cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to behave differently than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.ret
