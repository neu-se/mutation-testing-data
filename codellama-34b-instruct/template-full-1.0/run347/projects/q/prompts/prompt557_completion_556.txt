  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always result in the next value for the operation instead of the current value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always result in a larger value for the operation instead of the current value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always result in a smaller value for the operation instead of the current value.

DONE.
