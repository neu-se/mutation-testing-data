  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'];
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg']` is undefined, so the code would throw a `TypeError` instead of a `SyntaxError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw "Invalid Param";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a string instead of a `SyntaxError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log an error message to the console instead of throwing an exception.

DONE.
