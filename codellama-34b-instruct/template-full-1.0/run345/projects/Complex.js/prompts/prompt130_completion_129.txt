  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both operands are infinite, while this modified code checks if neither operand is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both operands are infinite, while this modified code checks if at least one operand is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNegative']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both operands are infinite, while this modified code checks if the first operand is negative and the second operand is infinite.

DONE.
