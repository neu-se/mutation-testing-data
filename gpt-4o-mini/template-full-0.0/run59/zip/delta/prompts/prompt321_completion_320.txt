Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete && typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logical condition from an "or" to an "and," meaning that the code block will only execute if both conditions are true, potentially skipping valid operations that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks if `op.delete` is `false`, which would ignore any operations where `op.delete` is `true`, leading to incorrect handling of delete operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is `null`, which would cause the code to skip over operations that have a valid retain value, potentially leading to incorrect transformations of the Delta.

DONE.
