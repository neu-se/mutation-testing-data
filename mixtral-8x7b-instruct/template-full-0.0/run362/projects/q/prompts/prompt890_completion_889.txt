 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `callback` function using `apply` instead of using the `nfapply` method from the `Q` library. This change would bypass any behavior specific to the `nfapply` method, such as error handling or promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `when` method from the `Q` library with the `apply` method, which is not equivalent to the original `nfapply` method. The `when` method is used to wrap an immediate value into a promise, while `nfapply` is used to pass a continuation to a Node function and return a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `then` method from the built-in `Promise` object
