  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but it is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a resolved promise, but it is not a deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but it is not a promise.

DONE.
