  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is being applied to the wrong variable. In the original code, `cos` is applied to `point1Rad`, but in this modified code, it is applied to `point2Rad`. This would cause the calculation of the distance to be incorrect, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is being applied to the wrong variable. In the original code, `sin` is applied to `point2Rad`, but in this modified code, it is applied to `point1Rad`. This would cause the calculation of the distance to be incorrect, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function is being applied to the wrong variable. In the original code, `tan`
