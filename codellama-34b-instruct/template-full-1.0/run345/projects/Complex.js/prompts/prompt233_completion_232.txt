  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `*` operator, which is the correct operator for multiplying two numbers, while using `a` and `b` as operands. Using the `*` operator with a non-numeric operand would result in the operand being converted to a number, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `-` operator, which is the correct operator for subtracting two numbers, while using `a` and `b` as operands. Using the `-` operator with non-numeric operands would result in the operand being converted to a number, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `/` operator, which is the correct operator for dividing two numbers, while using `a` and `
