  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both the presence of a protocol and the absence of "localhost" at the beginning of the string, while the new code fragment only checks for the presence of a protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both the presence of a protocol and the absence of "localhost" at the beginning of the string, while the new code fragment only checks for the presence of a protocol and allows for the possibility of a "localhost" at the beginning of the string.
