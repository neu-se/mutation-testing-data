  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getTimezone"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would get the timezone name from the `timezones` object instead of calling the `getTimezone` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getTimezone" + "()"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with an empty parameter list, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getTimezone" + "(" + ")"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with a parameter list containing one parameter, which would also result in an error.

DONE.
