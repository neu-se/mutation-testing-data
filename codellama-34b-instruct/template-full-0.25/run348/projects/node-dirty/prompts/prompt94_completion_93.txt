  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` returns a string representation of the input object, while `JSON.parse` parses a string representation of JSON into an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` is a constructor function that returns a number value, while `JSON.parse` parses a string representation of JSON into an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Boolean
```
This would result in different behavior because `Boolean` is a constructor function that returns a boolean value, while `JSON.parse` parses a string representation of JSON into an object.

DONE.
