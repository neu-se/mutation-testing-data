  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops` is an array, but it would not check if `ops` is a well-formed array of `Op` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops` is an empty array, but it would not check if `ops` is a well-formed array of `Op` objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.every(op => op.insert || op.delete || op.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if every element in `ops` is an `Op` object with at least one of the `insert`, `delete`, or `retain` properties set.

DONE.
