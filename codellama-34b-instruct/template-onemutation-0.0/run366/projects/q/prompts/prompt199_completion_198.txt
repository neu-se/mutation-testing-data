  
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!hasStacks && typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only enable long stack traces if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set, which is not the case in the original code.
