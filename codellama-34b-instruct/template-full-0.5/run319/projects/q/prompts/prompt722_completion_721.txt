  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to reject the promise if any of the input promises are rejected, instead of ignoring them and waiting for all promises to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to wait for all promises to be fulfilled or rejected, instead of ignoring rejected promises and only waiting for fulfilled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled" && promise.inspect().value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to ignore promises that are fulfilled with a value of `undefined`, instead of treating them as fulfilled promises.

DONE.
