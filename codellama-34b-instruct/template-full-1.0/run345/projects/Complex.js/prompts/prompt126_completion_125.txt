  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true if z is infinite, regardless of the sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['re']) > Math.abs(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the real part is bigger than the imaginary part, instead of checking for infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, and the code after the if statement would never be executed.

DONE.
