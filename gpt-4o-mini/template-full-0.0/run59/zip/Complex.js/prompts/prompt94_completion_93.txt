Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the string '0' to be treated as a valid number, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of complex numbers when '0' is not intended to be part of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'NaN'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat the string 'NaN' as a valid number, which could lead to unexpected results when parsing complex numbers, as 'NaN' should not be a valid input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the string 'undefined' to be treated as a valid number, which is nonsensical in the context of parsing complex numbers and could lead to erroneous calculations.

DONE.
