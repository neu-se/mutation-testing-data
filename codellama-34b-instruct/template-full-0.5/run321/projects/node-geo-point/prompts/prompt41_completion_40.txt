  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point2Rad` variable is not defined in the code snippet provided, so the mutated code would produce a reference error and fail to execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, so the mutated code would produce a reference error and fail to execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan2(point1Rad, point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, so the mutated code would produce a reference error and fail to execute.

DONE.
