  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `args` array starting from the second element, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.concat(["extra"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a concatenation of the `args` array and the string `"extra"`, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a reversed version of the `args` array, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

DONE.
