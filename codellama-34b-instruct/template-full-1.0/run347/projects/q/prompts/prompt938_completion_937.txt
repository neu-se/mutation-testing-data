  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello, world!"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfbind()` would return a promise that resolves to the string "Hello, world!" instead of a function that wraps the original callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfbind()` would return a promise that resolves to null instead of a function that wraps the original callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfbind()` would return a promise that resolves to true instead of a function that wraps the original callback.

DONE.
