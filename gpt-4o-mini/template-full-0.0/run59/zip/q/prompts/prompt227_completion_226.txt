Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the arguments to the `messages` array if it is empty, potentially causing the promise to not store any messages if it has already received messages before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!messages
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `messages` is falsy (undefined or null), which would prevent any arguments from being pushed to `messages` after the promise has been resolved, effectively ignoring any further dispatches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the arguments to the `messages` array if there are more than one argument, which could lead to missing important dispatch information if the operation only has a single argument.

DONE.
