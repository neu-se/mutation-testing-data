  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the callback is not a function, but this replacement would throw an error regardless of the type of the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the callback is not a function, but this replacement would throw an error regardless of the type of the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the callback is not a function, but this replacement would throw an error regardless of the type of the callback.

DONE.
