Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the length of the data is falsy instead of applying the operation `op` to the data, which may lead to incorrect handling of the data based on its length rather than its actual content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the operation `op`, meaning that the logic will now proceed if `op(data)` returns a truthy value, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `op` is designed to validate or transform the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks if the data is `null`, which would bypass the intended operation `op` and only trigger the condition when the data is explicitly `null`, potentially ignoring other falsy values like `undefined` or `0`.

DONE.
