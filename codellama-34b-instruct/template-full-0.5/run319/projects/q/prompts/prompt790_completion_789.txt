  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value and would be passed as an argument to `then` instead of `undefined`, which could cause the promise to be resolved with an unexpected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value and would be passed as an argument to `then` instead of `null`, which could cause the promise to be resolved with an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value and would be passed as an argument to `then` instead of `null` or `undefined`, which could cause the promise to be resolved with an unexpected value.

DONE.
