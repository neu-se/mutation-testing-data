  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function, while `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, while `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.coth
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.coth` is the hyperbolic cotangent function, while `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

DONE.
