  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains an invalid character, while this new code fragment checks if the path does not contain an invalid character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains an invalid character and starts with a slash, while this new code fragment checks if the path contains an invalid character and does not start with a slash.
