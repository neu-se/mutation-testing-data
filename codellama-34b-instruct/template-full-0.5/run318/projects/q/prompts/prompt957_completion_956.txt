  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved after a specified delay, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().resolve` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the specified value, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved immediately.

DONE.
