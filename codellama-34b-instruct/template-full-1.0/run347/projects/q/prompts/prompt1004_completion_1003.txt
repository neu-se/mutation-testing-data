  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes an array to the `dispatch` method, while this mutant would pass a string. This could potentially cause the code to take a different path, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes a an array of arguments to the `dispatch` method, while this mutant would pass the length of that array. This could potentially cause the code to take a different path, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeArgs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes an array of arguments to the `dispatch` method, while this mutant would pass a boolean value indicating whether that array is empty or not. This could potentially cause the code to take a different path, leading to different behavior.

DONE.
