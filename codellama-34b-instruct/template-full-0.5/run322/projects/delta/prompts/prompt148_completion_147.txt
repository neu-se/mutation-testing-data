  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (index < end && iter.hasNext()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition in the while loop would be evaluated to false, and the loop would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (index <= end && iter.hasNext()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would be executed one extra time, which would result in an error when the iterator is exhausted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (index < end && iter.hasNext() && iter.peek() !== null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would be executed only while the iterator has a next element and the peeked element is not null.

DONE.
