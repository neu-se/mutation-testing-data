  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a different function than `reject`, and it would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong!")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause an exception to be thrown, which would be handled by the code that is waiting for the promise to be resolved. The error would be caught and turned into a rejection, but it would still be a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Something went wrong!"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly return a rejection, but with a different error message. This would still result in the promise being rejected, but with a different error message.

DONE.
