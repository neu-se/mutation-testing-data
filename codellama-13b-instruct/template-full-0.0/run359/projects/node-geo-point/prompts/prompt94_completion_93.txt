  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` is a different function than `asin`, which is a built-in function in JavaScript. `Math.asin` is a static method that returns the arcsine of a number, while `asin` is a global function that returns the arcsine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a different function than `sin`, which is a built-in function in JavaScript. `Math.sin` is a static method that returns the sine of a number, while `sin` is a global function that returns the sine of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is a different function than `cos`, which is a built-in function in JavaScript. `Math.cos` is
