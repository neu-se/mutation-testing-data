  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread function would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.resolve;
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread function would always return a resolved promise, even if the generator throws an error or encounters a StopIteration exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread function would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to an error.

DONE.
