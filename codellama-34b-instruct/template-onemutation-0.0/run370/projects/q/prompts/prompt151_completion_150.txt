  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds the element to the end of the array, whereas `unshift` adds it to the beginning. In this case, the order of the stack traces would be reversed, which could potentially cause issues with the error handling and debugging process.

DONE.
