```javascript
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` creates a new rejected promise, while `reject` is a reference to the `Q.reject` function. This change would cause the code to always create a new rejected promise instead of using the one provided by the `Q` library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is the correct way to reject the deferred object in the Q library, while `reject` is a reference to the `Q.reject` function. This change would cause the code to reject the deferred object instead of creating a new rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error('Rejection')
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with a reason, it throws an error. This would cause the code to behave differently because the error would not be
