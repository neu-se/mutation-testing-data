  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point1Rad) * cos(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the sum of the two angles, which is different from the original code that calculates the cosine of the difference of the two angles.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the sum of the two angles, which is different from the original code that calculates the sine of the difference of the two angles.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(point1Rad) * tan(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the tangent of the sum of the two angles, which is different from the original code that calculates the tangent of the difference of the two angles.

DONE.
