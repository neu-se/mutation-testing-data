  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a minus sign, while this new code fragment is checking for the absence of a minus sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a minus sign, while this new code fragment is checking for the presence of a plus sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a minus sign, while this new code fragment is checking for the presence of a multiplication sign.

DONE.
