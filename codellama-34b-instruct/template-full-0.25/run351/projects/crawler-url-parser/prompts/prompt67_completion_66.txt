  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to `true` if the `search` parameter is not equal to the `query` parameter, instead of `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"=="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to `false` if the `search` parameter is equal to the `query` parameter, instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object would be set to `false` if the `search` parameter is not equal to the `query` parameter, instead of `true`.

DONE.
