  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to always return an empty object, even if `base` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.forEach(key => {
  if (!isEqual(a[key], b[key])) {
    attrs[key] = b[key] === undefined ? null : b[key];
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` method to compare `base` and `a` element-wise rather than `base` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.prototype.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to be applied to `base.prototype` rather than `base`.

DONE.
