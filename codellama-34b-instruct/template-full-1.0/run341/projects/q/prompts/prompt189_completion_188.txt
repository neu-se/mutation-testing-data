  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` constructor converts a value to a number, while the `String` constructor converts a value to a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `desiredLines` is an array of lines, and by popping the last item, the function would not join the lines correctly, potentially resulting in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
raise NotImplementedError()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `raise` keyword is not defined in JavaScript, and the `NotImplementedError()` function would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
