  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator is replaced with `<`, which would cause the code to execute differently when `_inFlightWrites` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._writeStream.writable
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writable` property of the `_writeStream` object is now being checked, which could cause the code to behave differently depending on the state of the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.getLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getLength()` method is being called on the `_queue` object, which could cause the code to behave differently depending on the number of items in the queue.

DONE.
