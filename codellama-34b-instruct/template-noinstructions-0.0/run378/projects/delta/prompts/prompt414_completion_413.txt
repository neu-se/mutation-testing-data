  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` expects a number as an argument, but `length` is undefined in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` would return the length of the next operation, but `1` is a fixed value that may not match the length of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(thisIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` would return the length of the next operation, but `thisIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the current operation, which may not match the length of the next operation.

DONE.
