  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of the operation, making it return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor.prototype[op]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would look up the operation on the prototype of the descriptor object, rather than on the descriptor object itself. This could potentially result in a different method being called, or no method being called at all if the prototype doesn't have the correct method defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the operation as a function, rather than looking up the result of the operation. This could potentially result in a different value being returned, or an error being thrown if the operation is not a function.

DONE.
