  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` object has at least one key, while the mutated code checks if it has more than one key. This could cause the `insert` method to behave differently if the `attributes` object has only one key.

DONE.
