  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the line starting from the second character, rather than the entire line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of the line starting from the second character, rather than the entire line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of the line starting from the second character, rather than the entire line.

DONE.
