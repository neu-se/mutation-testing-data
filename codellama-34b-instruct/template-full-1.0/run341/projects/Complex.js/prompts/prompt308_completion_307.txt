  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the cosh function, which is used in the calculation of the tan and cot functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the sinh function, which is used in the calculation of the tan and cot functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the sin function, which is used in the calculation of the tan and cot functions.

DONE.
