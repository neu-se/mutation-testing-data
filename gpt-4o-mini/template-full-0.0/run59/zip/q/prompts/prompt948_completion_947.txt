Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing a function that resolves the promise, it passes a random number, which does not match the expected behavior of resolving the promise with the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of a function would cause the promise to not resolve correctly, leading to potential unhandled promise rejections or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise, it would immediately reject it, causing any subsequent `.then()` handlers to be skipped and the promise chain to fail.

DONE.
