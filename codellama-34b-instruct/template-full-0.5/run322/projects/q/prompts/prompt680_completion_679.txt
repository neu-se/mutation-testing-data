  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current execution context, which may not be the same as the `object` argument passed to the `Q.try` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument passed to the `Q.try` function, which may be important for the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1), void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra `void 0` argument to the `Q.try` function, which may cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
