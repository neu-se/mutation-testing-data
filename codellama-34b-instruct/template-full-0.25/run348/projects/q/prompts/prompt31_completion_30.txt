  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `pop` method to return `undefined` instead of the last element of the array, which would cause the `runSingle` function to be called with `undefined` as its argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `pop` method to return `undefined` instead of the last element of the array, which would cause the `runSingle` function to be called with `undefined` as its argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(laterQueue.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `pop` method to return the last element of the array instead of `undefined`, which would cause the `runSingle` function to be
