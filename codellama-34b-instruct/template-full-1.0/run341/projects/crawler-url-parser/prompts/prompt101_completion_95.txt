  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would overwrite the existing value in the map with the new one, whereas the `get` method would return the existing value without modifying it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` method would return the number of elements in the map, whereas the `get` method would return the value associated with the given key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.startsWith("abc")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method checks if the given string starts with the specified sequence, whereas the `get` method would return the value associated with the given key.

DONE.
