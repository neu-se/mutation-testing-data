  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comma, which separates elements in an array, while a semicolon is a statement separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comma, which separates elements in an array, while a pipe character is used for bitwise OR operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comma, which separates elements in an array, while an ampersand character is used for bitwise AND operations.

DONE.
