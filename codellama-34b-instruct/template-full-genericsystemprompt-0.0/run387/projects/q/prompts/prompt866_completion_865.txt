  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but `defer(null)` would return a promise that is already resolved with the value `null`, which would cause the `delay` method to return a promise that is already resolved, rather than a promise that is resolved after the specified delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but `defer(undefined)` would return a promise that is already resolved with the value `undefined`, which would cause the `delay` method to return a promise that is already resolved, rather than a promise that is resolved after the specified delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but `defer(new Error())`
