  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the `type` property was not equal to `'Point'`, while this replacement checks if it is equal to `'Point'` instead. If the `type` property is equal to `'Point'`, this replacement would return `true` instead of `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the `type` property was not equal to `'Point'`, while this replacement checks if it is not equal to `'point'` instead. If the `type` property is equal to `'Point'`, this replacement would return `false` instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the `type` property was not equal to `'Point'`, while this replacement checks
