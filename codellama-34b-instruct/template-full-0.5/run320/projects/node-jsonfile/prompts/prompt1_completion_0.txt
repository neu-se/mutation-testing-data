  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it is not a string. This could cause the `options` argument to be interpreted as an object, even if it is not, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `readFile` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding !== 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument has an `encoding` property that is equal to `'utf8'`, while this new code fragment checks if the `encoding` property is not equal to `'utf8'`. This could cause the `options` argument to be interpreted as having a different encoding, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `readFile` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the
