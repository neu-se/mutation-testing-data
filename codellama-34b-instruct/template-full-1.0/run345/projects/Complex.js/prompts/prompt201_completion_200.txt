  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because when the PLACEHOLDER is NaN, the code will throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because when the PLACEHOLDER is 1, the code will return Complex.INFINITY.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because when the PLACEHOLDER is 0, the code will return Complex.ONE.

DONE.
