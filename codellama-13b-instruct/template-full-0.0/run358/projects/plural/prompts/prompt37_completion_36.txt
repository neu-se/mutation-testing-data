  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `|` operator to match either "appendix" or "index", while the new code fragment uses the `i` flag to match either "appendix" or "index" case-insensitively. This would cause the pluralization function to return different results for words that end in "appendix" or "index", depending on whether the `i` flag is used or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
