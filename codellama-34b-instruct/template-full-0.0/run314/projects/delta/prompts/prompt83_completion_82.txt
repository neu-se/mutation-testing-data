  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the attributes are different, even if the attributes are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes == lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if the attributes are different, even if the attributes are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes && newOp.insert !== lastOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the attributes and insert values are different, even if the attributes are equal.

DONE.
