  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options, "invalid-option"
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the invalid option would cause the `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` function to throw an error, which would trigger the `catch` block and return `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value would cause the `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` function to return an empty string instead of the expected object, resulting in a type error when trying to parse the JSON data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty object would cause the `stringify` function to throw an error, resulting in a different error message than the original code.

DONE.
