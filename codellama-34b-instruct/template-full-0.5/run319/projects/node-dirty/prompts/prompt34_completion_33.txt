  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function `cb` with no arguments, while the new code fragment does not call the callback function at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('something went wrong') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function `cb` with no arguments, while the new code fragment throws an error instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { this.emit('error', new Error('something went wrong')) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function `cb` with no arguments, while the new code fragment emits an error event instead.

DONE.
