  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the given number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to the given number, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the given number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of the given numbers, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the given number.

DONE.
