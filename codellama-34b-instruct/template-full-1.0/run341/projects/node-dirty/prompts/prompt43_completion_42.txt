  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the current value of the key-value pair to the `update` method, instead of the original key, which would cause the method to update the wrong key-value pair.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the wrong key-value pair in the `this._data` map, potentially causing the `forEach` method to iterate over incorrect values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val, key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value as the first argument to the `update` method, instead of the key, which would cause the method to update the wrong key-value pair.

DONE.
