  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never end, causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never end, causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never end, causing an infinite loop.

DONE.
