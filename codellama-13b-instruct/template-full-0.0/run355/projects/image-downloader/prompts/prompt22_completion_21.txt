  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.join` function would be used to concatenate the `options.dest` path with the `decodedBasename` string, whereas the original code used the `path.resolve` function to resolve the `options.dest` path to an absolute path. This could potentially result in different file paths being used for the downloaded image, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.dirname` function would be used to get the directory name of the `options.dest` path, whereas the original code used the `path.resolve` function to resolve the `options.dest` path to an absolute path. This could potentially result in different file paths being used for the downloaded image, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in
