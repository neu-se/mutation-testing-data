  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bootstrap.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bootstrap` object does not have a `promise` property, so the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bootstrap.promise()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bootstrap` object does not have a `promise` method, so the code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bootstrap.promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bootstrap` object does not have a `promise` property, so the code would throw an error.

DONE.
