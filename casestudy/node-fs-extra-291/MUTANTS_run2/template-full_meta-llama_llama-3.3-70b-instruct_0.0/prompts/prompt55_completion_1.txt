Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be the target path instead of the current path, potentially causing the function to incorrectly replace the path in the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
basePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be the base path instead of the current path, potentially causing the function to incorrectly replace the path in the file name and leading to incorrect file copying.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be an empty string, effectively removing the current path from the file name and potentially causing the function to copy files to incorrect locations.

DONE.
