Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly call the `resolve` method instead of the `notify` method, leading to the promise being resolved instead of notifying progress listeners.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method instead of the `notify` method, causing the promise to be rejected with no reason provided, rather than notifying progress listeners.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notifyAll
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call a non-existent `notifyAll` method, which would lead to a runtime error, instead of executing the intended `notify` functionality.

DONE.
