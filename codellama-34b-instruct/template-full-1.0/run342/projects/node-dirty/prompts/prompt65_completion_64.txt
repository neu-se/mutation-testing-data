  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._readStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_writeStream` would not be destroyed, and the data written to the stream would not be deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_data` map would be cleared, and the data written to the stream would not be deleted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.write(JSON.stringify({key, val: null}))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_data` map would be updated with a `null` value, and the data written to the stream would not be deleted.

DONE.
