  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would change the outcome of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 10 would change the outcome of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by -1 would change the sign of the outcome of the calculation.

DONE.
