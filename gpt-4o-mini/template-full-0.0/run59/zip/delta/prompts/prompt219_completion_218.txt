Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length === other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the two deltas have the same number of operations, rather than checking if they are identical in content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for reference inequality, meaning it will return true if the two deltas are different objects in memory, even if they contain the same operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.some((op, index) => op !== other.ops[index])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if any operation in `this.ops` is not equal to the corresponding operation in `other.ops`, which could lead to false negatives if the operations are equal but not strictly identical (e.g., different object references).

DONE.
