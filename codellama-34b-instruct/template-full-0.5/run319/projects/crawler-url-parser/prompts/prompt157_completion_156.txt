  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of strings, whereas `replace` returns a string. This change would cause the `gettype` function to fail when it tries to call the `includes` method on an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` returns the number of characters in a string, whereas `replace` returns a string. This change would cause the `gettype` function to fail when it tries to call the `includes` method on a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a portion of a string, whereas `replace` returns a string. This change would cause the `gettype` function to fail when it tries to call the `includes` method on a portion of a string.

DONE.
