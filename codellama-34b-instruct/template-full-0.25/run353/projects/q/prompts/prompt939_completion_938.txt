  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array by combining the elements of two or more arrays, while `push` adds new elements to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` combines the elements of two or more arrays, while `shift` removes the first element of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` combines the elements of two or more arrays, while `slice` creates a new array by extracting a section of an array.

DONE.
