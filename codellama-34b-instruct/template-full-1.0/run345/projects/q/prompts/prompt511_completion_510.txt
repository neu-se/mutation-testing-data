  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `thisp` is used as the `this` value for the `apply` method, but replacing it with "null" would cause the `apply` method to be called with a `this` value of null, which could change the behavior of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `thisp` is used as the `this` value for the `apply` method, but replacing it with "undefined" would cause the `apply` method to be called with a `this` value of undefined, which could change the behavior of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"empty".
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `thisp` is used as the `this` value for the `apply` method, but replacing it with "empty" would cause the
