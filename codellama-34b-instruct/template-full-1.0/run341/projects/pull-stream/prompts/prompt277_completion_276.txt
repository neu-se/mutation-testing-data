  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `abort` is truthy, but does not assign `true` to it. Assigning `true` to `abort` would cause the code to take a different path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `_read` is not null, but does not assign `null` to it. Assigning `null` to `_read` would cause the code to take a different path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || err, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `read` with either `err` or `abort`, but not both. Calling `read` with both `abort` and `err` would cause the code to take a different path.

DONE.
