  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would cause it to return an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with `null` as the second argument, which would cause it to return an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with `true` as the first argument, which would cause it to return an error.

DONE.
