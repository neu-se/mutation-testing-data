  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would slice the `arguments` object from the second argument, while the replaced code fragment `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would slice the `arguments` object from the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would slice the `arguments` object from the second argument, while the replaced code fragment `arguments.slice(1)` would slice the `arguments` object from the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
