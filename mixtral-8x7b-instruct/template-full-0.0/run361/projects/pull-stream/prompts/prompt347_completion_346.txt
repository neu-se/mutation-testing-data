 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the 'prop' property of the data object, which may not exist, instead of using the provided key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.data
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the 'data' property of the current object (if any), instead of using the provided key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.data
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the 'data' variable in the global scope, which may not exist or may have a different value.

DONE.
