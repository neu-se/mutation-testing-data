  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the input value is not a rejected thenable or a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved, even if the input value is a thenable or a promise that has not yet been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to return itself, instead of the resolved or rejected value of the input promise.

DONE.
