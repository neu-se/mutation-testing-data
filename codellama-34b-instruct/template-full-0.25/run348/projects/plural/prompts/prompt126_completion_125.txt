  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `num !== 1` and `num === undefined`, but the new code fragment only checks for `num !== 1`. This means that if `num` is undefined, the original code would return the plural form of the word, while the new code would return the singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `num !== 1` and `num === undefined`, but the new code fragment checks for `num !== 1` or `num === null`. This means that if `num` is null, the original code would return the plural form of the word, while the new code would return the singular form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
