  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `prev` object, while the modified code fragment returns only the property with the specified `id`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[id] = getCountry(id, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `prev` object, while the modified code fragment returns only the property with the specified `id` and the result of calling the `getCountry` function with the specified `id` and `options`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[id] = getCountry(id, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `prev` object, while the modified code fragment returns only the property with the specified `id` and the result of calling the `getCountry` function with the specified `id` and `options`.

DONE.
