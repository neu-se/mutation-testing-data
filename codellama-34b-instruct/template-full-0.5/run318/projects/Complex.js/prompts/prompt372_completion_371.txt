  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part. Using `a` instead of `b` would cause the `Math.sin()` function to receive a different argument, leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying `b` by 2 would change the argument passed to the `Math.sin()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because adding `a` and `b` would change the argument passed to the `Math.sin()` function.

DONE.
