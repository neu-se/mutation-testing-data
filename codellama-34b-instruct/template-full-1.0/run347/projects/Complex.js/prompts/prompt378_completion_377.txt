  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asin` function takes a single argument, and `a * 2` would result in a different value than just `a`, leading to a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asin` function takes a single argument, and `b / a` would result in a different value than just `a`, leading to a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asin` function takes a single argument, and `a + 1` would result in a different value than just `a`, leading to a different output.

DONE.
