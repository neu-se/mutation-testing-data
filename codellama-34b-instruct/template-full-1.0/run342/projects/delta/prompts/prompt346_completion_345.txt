  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would shift the result of the operation by 1, potentially causing errors in the code that uses the transformed delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would shift the result of the operation by -1, potentially causing errors in the code that uses the transformed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the result of the operation, potentially causing errors in the code that uses the transformed delta.

DONE.
