  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosδ - sinφ1 * sinφ2
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, which is:
```
cosδ - sinφ1 * sinφ2
```
The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the `cos` function, which should be `cosφ2` instead of `cosδ`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosφ2
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, which is:
```
sinφ1 * cosφ2
```
The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the `sin` function, which should be `sinφ2` instead of `sinφ1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1 * sinφ2
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, which is:
```
cosφ1 * sinφ2
```
The bug is caused by the incorrect use of
