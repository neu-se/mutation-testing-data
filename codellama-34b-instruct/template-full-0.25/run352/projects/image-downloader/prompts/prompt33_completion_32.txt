  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.resume()` is a function that resumes the reading of the response stream, whereas `res.resume` is a property that indicates whether the response stream has been resumed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode = 404;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the status code of the response to 404, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and the `reject` function to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream('invalid_file_name'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the destination file name to an invalid file name, which would cause the `createWriteStream` function to throw an error and the `reject` function to be called.

DONE.
