 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the parsing behavior of the URL, potentially causing some valid URLs to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it disables the query string parsing, which could lead to incorrect handling of query parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it enables the slash-and-protocol-relative URLs, which could lead to incorrect parsing of URLs with a different format.

DONE.
