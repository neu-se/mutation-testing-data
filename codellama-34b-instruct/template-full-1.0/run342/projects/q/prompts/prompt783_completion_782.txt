  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, onUnhandledError)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` will be called with the result of `then` instead of the original `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` will be called with the result of `then` instead of the original `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object).then(void 0, onUnhandledError)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise returned by `Q.resolve` will not have the same behavior as `object` when `Q.resolve` is called with a non-promise value.

DONE.
