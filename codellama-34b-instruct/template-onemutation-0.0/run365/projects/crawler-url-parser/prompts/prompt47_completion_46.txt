  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property is not defined for the `parsedBaseUrl` object, which is an instance of the `URL` class. Therefore, accessing this property would result in a `TypeError` being thrown, indicating that the code is not functioning as intended.
