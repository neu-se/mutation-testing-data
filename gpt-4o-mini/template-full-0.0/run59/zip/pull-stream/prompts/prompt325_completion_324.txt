Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `once` function regardless of the value of `end`, potentially leading to premature termination of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would never call the `once` function, meaning that the `onEnd` callback would never be executed, even when the stream ends.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `once` function when `end` is explicitly `null`, which may not cover all cases where the stream should end, leading to missed callbacks.

DONE.
