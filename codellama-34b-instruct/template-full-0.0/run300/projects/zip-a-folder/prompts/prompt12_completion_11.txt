  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.W_OK` flag is not present in the original code, which means that the code would not check for write access to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.X_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.X_OK` flag is not present in the original code, which means that the code would not check for execute access to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.F_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.F_OK
