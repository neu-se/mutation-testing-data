Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the value of `ended` to the callback instead of `null`, which could lead to incorrect handling of the end state in the calling function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends two `null` values to the callback instead of just passing the data, which may cause the consumer of the callback to misinterpret the result or fail to process the data correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly indicates that the operation has ended (by passing `true` as the first argument) while still providing the data, which could confuse the logic that relies on the end state.

DONE.
