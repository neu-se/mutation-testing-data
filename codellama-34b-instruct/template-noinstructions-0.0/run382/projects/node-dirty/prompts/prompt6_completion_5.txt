  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value at the given key to the given value, while this code fragment deletes the value at the given key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value at the given key to the given value, while this code fragment sets the value at the given key to the given value and then immediately deletes it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value at the given key to the given value, while this code fragment sets the value at the given key to the given value plus one.

DONE.
