  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == false
```
This change will cause the `nextStream()` function to be called even when there is no error, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This change will cause the `nextStream()` function to be called only when there is an error, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== false
```
This change will cause the `nextStream()` function to be called only when there is an error, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
