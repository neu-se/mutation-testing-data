Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds the offset up to the nearest integer, which could lead to incorrect hour calculations compared to `Math.floor`, which rounds down.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds the offset to the nearest integer, which may not accurately reflect the intended UTC offset, unlike `Math.floor`, which consistently rounds down.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset
```
This would result in different behavior because directly using `offset` without any transformation would not convert it to hours, leading to incorrect formatting of the offset string compared to the original implementation that divides by 60.

DONE.
