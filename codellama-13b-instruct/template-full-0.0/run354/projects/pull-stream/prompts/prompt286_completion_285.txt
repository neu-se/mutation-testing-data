  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now set to `true`, which would cause the `map` function to return an empty array instead of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is now set to `null`, which would cause the `map` function to return the original array without applying any mapping.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper = function (data) { return data + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is now set to a function that adds 1 to each element of the array, which would cause the `map` function to return a new array with the elements incremented by 1.

DONE.
