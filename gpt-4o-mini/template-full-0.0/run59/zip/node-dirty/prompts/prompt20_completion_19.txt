Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flushData();
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls a non-existent method `_flushData`, which would throw an error, preventing the intended flushing of data to the disk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `_flush` method to `null`, meaning that any subsequent calls to `_flush` would result in a TypeError since `null` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `_flush` method directly without checking if it exists or is a function, which could lead to a runtime error if `_flush` is not defined or is not a callable function.

DONE.
