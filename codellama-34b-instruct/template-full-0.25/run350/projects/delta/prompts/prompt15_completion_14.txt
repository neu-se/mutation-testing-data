  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `a` is null. If `a` is null, the original code would return `{}`, while this replacement would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `a` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the original code would return `{}`, while this replacement would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, the original code would return `{}`, while this
