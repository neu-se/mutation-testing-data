  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if an array contains a certain element, whereas the original code fragment checks the type of `process` and whether it has an `emit` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if an array contains a certain element, whereas the original code fragment checks the type of `process` and whether it has an `emit` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method returns the index of a certain element in an array, whereas the original code fragment checks the type of `process` and whether it has an `emit` function.

DONE.
