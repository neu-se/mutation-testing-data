  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, and the `unhandledRejections` array would not be updated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, and the `unhandledRejections` array would not be updated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with the `reason` property of the `rejection` object, which is not the same as the `rejection` object itself.

DONE.
