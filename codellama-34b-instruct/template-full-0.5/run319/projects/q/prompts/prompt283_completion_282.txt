  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different argument to the `Q.all` method, which could cause the promise to resolve or reject differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different argument to the `Q.all` method, which could cause the promise to resolve or reject differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value to the `Q.all` method, which could cause the promise to reject with a `TypeError`.

DONE.
