  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spec` variable is converted to uppercase, which would affect the behavior of the `compile` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spec` variable is converted to lowercase, which would affect the behavior of the `compile` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spec` variable is modified to remove all alphanumeric characters, which would affect the behavior of the `compile` function.

DONE.
