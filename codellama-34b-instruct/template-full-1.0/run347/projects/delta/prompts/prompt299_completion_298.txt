  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(delta - other[0])
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would subtract the first element of the `other` array from the `delta` variable, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(delta + other[0])
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would add the first element of the `other` array to the `delta` variable, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(delta * other[0])
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would multiply the `delta` variable by the first element of the `other` array, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
