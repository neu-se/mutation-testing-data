  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the rejection reason, while this modified code fragment would reject the promise with the rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise with the rejection reason, while this modified code fragment would resolve the promise with the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw reason }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise with the rejection reason, while this modified code fragment would reject the promise with the rejection reason wrapped in a function.

DONE.
