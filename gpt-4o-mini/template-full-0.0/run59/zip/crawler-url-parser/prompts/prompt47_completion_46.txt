Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value being used to construct the base URL, potentially leading to an invalid URL format if the host is not a valid part of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.protocol + '//' + parsedBaseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly constructs the base URL using only the protocol and host, ignoring other components like path or query parameters, which may lead to incomplete or incorrect URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses only the pathname of the base URL, omitting the host and protocol, which would result in a malformed URL that cannot be resolved correctly.

DONE.
