 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof isNodeFrame !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `isNodeFrame` instead of its value, which could cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!isNodeFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of `isNodeFrame(stackLine)`, which could cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `true` for node frames.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNodeFrame(window)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the global `window` object is a node frame, which is unlikely to be the case and would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `false`.

DONE.
