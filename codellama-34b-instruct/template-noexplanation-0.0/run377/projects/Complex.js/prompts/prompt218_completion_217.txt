  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This change will cause the `cos` function to be replaced with `sin`, which will result in a different output for the `exp` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This change will cause the `cos` function to be replaced with `tan`, which will result in a different output for the `exp` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This change will cause the `cos` function to be replaced with `acos`, which will result in a different output for the `exp` function.

DONE.
