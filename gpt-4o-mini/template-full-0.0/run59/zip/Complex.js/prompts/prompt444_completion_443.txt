Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always increase the `places` value by 1, leading to a rounding effect that is less precise than intended, as it would round to a higher decimal place than specified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate `places` in a boolean context, resulting in `1` if `places` is truthy (non-zero) and `0` if it is falsy (zero), which would not correctly handle the intended decimal places for rounding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always round down the `places` value to the nearest integer, potentially leading to incorrect rounding behavior when the user expects to round to a specific number of decimal places.

DONE.
