  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+[/]$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is greedy, so it will match as many characters as possible before the `/`, whereas the original code fragment would only match a single character before the `/`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+[/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is now applied to the `/` character, so it will match one or more `/` characters, whereas the original code fragment would only match a single `/` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+[/]{2}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{2}` quantifier is applied to the `/` character, so it will match exactly two `/` characters, whereas the original code fragment would match any number of `/` characters.

DONE.
