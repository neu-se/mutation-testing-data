 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function call would throw a TypeError, as it expects an array-like object as its first argument. The original `array_slice` function is called with the `arguments` object, which is array-like but not an actual array. Replacing it with `null` would cause a runtime error, indicating that the tests do not handle such cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would receive a hardcoded array as its argument instead of the `arguments` object. This change would not cause a runtime error, but it would alter the behavior of the code, as the `array_slice` function would now operate on a fixed array instead of the dynamic list of arguments passed to the function. This indicates that the tests might not cover edge cases or unexpected input configurations.
