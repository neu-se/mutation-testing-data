  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-temp
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the value would be flipped, which could cause the calculation to produce an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be increased by 1, which could cause the calculation to produce an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be doubled, which could cause the calculation to produce an incorrect result.

DONE.
