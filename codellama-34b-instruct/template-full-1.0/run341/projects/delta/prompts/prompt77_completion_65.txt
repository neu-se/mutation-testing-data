  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp == null
```
This would result in different behavior because if `lastOp` is `null`, the code would throw an error since `null` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because if `lastOp` is `undefined`, the code would throw an error since it is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because if `lastOp` is a string, the code would treat it as an object and attempt to access its `delete` property, which would result in an error since strings do not have a `delete` property.

DONE.
