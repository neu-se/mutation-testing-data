  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which slices the `arguments` object from the first argument (index 1) to the end, while the new code fragment slices the `arguments` object from the second argument (index 2) to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which slices the `arguments` object from the first argument (index 1) to the end, while the new code fragment slices the `arguments` object from the third argument (index 3) to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `array_slice
