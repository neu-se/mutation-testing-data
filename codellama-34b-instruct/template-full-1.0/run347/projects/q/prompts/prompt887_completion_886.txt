  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a special object that refers to the arguments passed to a function, whereas `null` is a value that represents the absence of any object value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that represents the absence of any value, whereas `arguments` is a special object that refers to the arguments passed to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a special object that refers to the arguments passed to a function, whereas `[]` is an empty array that does not refer to any function arguments.

DONE.
