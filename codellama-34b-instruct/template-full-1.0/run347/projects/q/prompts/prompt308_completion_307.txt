  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that will reject the promise with the provided argument, whereas `resolve` is a function that will resolve the promise with the provided argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `then` method, whereas `resolve` and `reject` are functions that return a promise that has a `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a primitive value that does not have a `then` method, whereas `resolve` and `reject` are functions that return a promise that has a `then` method.

DONE.
