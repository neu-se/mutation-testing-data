  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneShallow
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneShallow` only makes a shallow copy of the object, while `cloneDeep` makes a deep copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` is a hack that serializes and deserializes the object, essentially creating a deep copy, but it may not work with all types of objects and can result in loss of information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign({}, obj)` only copies the own enumerable properties of the object, while `cloneDeep` recursively copies all properties, including non-enumerable ones.

DONE.
