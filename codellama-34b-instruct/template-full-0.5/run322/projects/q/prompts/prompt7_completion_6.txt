  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that returns a function, while this replacement is a function that throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { return "foo"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that returns a function, while this replacement is a function that returns a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { return () => { throw new Error(); }; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that returns a function, while this replacement is a function that returns a function that throws an error.

DONE.
