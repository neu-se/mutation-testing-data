Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument of the callback from `true` (indicating success) to `false`, which may lead to the caller interpreting the operation as a failure instead of a success.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `undefined` as the first argument to the callback instead of `true`, which could lead to unexpected handling of the callback result by the caller, as they may not be prepared to handle `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(_value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the first argument entirely, which may cause the caller to misinterpret the result of the callback, as it would not indicate whether the operation was successful or not.

DONE.
