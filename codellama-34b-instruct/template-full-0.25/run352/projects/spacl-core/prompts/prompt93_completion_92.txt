  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `policy` object as the value for the key `policy.name` in the map, rather than the `policy` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key `policy.name` to `null` in the map, rather than the `policy` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key `policy.name` to the value of the `policy.name` property of the `policy` object, rather than the `policy` object itself.

DONE.
