  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the original word, while the modified code fragment would return the word in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the original word, while the modified code fragment would return the length of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the original word, while the modified code fragment would return an array of the individual characters in the word.

DONE.
