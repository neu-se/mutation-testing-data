  Option 1:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because throwing an exception in a rejected state would cause the error to be thrown when the promise is created, rather than when it is returned.

Option 2:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because resolving the promise in a rejected state would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `undefined`, rather than being rejected.

Option 3:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` would create a new rejected promise, rather than being called with a value to reject the promise with.

DONE.
