  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code takes the entire arguments object, but the modified code only takes the arguments object starting from the second parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code takes the entire arguments object, but the modified code only takes the first element of the arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code takes the entire arguments object, but the modified code only takes the arguments object starting from the second parameter.

DONE.
