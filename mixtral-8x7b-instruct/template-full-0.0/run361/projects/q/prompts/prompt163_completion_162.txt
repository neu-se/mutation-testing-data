 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
";\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because a semicolon is automatically inserted before the `\n`, changing the behavior of the `split` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + String.fromCharCode(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a null character at the end of the lines, which might cause issues with some string processing functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + Math.random()
