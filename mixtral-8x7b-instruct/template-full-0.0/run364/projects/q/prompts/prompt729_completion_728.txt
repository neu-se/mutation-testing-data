 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line in the original code resolves the deferred promise with the original `promises` array, while replacing it with `null` resolves the promise with a `null` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
