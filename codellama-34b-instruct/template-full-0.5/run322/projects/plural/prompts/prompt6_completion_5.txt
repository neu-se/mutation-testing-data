  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a built-in method that returns a string representation of an object, whereas the original code fragment `obj` would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj[0]` would return the first element of the `obj` array, whereas the original code fragment `obj` would return the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.length` would return the length of the `obj` array, whereas the original code fragment `obj` would return the entire array.

DONE.
