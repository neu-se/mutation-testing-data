  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff algorithm to consider one more character than it should, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff algorithm to consider one less character than it should, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff algorithm to use the length of the other iterator instead of the current iterator, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
