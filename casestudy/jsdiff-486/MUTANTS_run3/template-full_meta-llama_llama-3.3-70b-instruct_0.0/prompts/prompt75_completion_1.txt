Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `hasOwnProperty` method directly on the `obj` object, which may not exist or may be overridden, whereas the original code uses `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` to ensure the method is called with the correct context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key in obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for property existence in the prototype chain, whereas the original code only checks for own properties using `hasOwnProperty`, potentially including inherited properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!obj[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property value is not undefined, whereas the original code checks if the property exists as an own property, regardless of its value, potentially excluding properties with undefined values.

DONE.
