  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be doubled, which would lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be reduced by 1000 meters, which would lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be increased by 1000 meters, which would lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method.

DONE.
