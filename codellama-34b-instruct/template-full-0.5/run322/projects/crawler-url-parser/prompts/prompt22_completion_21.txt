  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment uses a different protocol (HTTPS instead of HTTP).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment uses a different protocol (FTP instead of HTTP).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment adds the "www." subdomain to the URL.

DONE.
