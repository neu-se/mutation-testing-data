  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because "result.value" is not a promise, but "result.value, callback, errback" is a promise. Therefore, changing the code such that "result.value" is not a promise will break the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.errback
```
This would result in different behavior because "result.errback" is not a function, but "callback, errback" is a function. Therefore, changing the code such that "result.errback" is not a function will break the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
endl
```
This would result in different behavior because "endl" is a type-checking keyword in Python, but "result.value, callback, errback" is not a type-checking keyword. Therefore, changing the code such that "endl" is a type-checking keyword will break the code.

DONE.
