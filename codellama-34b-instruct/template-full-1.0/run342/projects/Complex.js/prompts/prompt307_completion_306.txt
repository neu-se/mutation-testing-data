  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would negate the result of `cos`, causing the value to change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` takes a single argument, unlike `cosh` which takes two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` takes a single argument, unlike `cosh` which takes two arguments.

DONE.
