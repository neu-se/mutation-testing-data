  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'undefined' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'undefined'` instead of `'object'`, causing the condition to always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'string' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'string'` instead of `'object'`, causing the condition to always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be checking for an empty object instead of a non-empty object, causing the condition to always be false.

DONE.
