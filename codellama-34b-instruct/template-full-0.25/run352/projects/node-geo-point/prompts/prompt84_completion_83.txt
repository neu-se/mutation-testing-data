  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is being applied to the wrong argument. The original code fragment correctly applies `cos` to `φ1`, but this replacement applies it to `φ2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) - cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the signs of the `sin` and `cos` functions are flipped. The original code fragment correctly applies `sin` to `φ1` and `cos` to `φ2`, but this replacement applies them in the opposite order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) * sin(
