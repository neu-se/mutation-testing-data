  Option 1:
```
value.inspect(value).state === "fulfilled"
```
This option replaces the `PLACEHOLDER` with `value.inspect(value).state`, which is a different expression than the original code fragment `inspected.value`. The `inspect` method is called on the `value` object, with the `value` object itself as the argument, which will result in a recursive call to the `inspect` method. This will cause the code to go into an infinite loop, leading to a stack overflow error.

Option 2:
```
value.inspect(inspected).state === "fulfilled"
```
This option replaces the `PLACEHOLDER` with `value.inspect(inspected).state`, which is another different expression than the original code fragment `inspected.value`. The `inspect` method is called on the `value` object, with the `inspected` object as the argument, which will result in a recursive call to the `inspect` method. This will also cause the code to go into an infinite loop, leading to a stack overflow error.
