  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a;
```
This would result in the negation of the `a` variable, potentially causing issues in the calculation of the `Complex` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b;
```
This would result in a different expression, potentially changing the behavior of the `Complex` object's `isZero()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b;
```
This would result in a different expression, potentially changing the behavior of the `Complex` object's `isZero()` method.

DONE.
