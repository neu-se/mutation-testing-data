  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of `test`, so if `test` is truthy, `!test` will be falsy, and if `test` is falsy, `!test` will be truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `test === 0` checks if `test` is equal to `0`, whereas `test` by itself checks if `test` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `test !== 0` checks if `test` is not equal to `0`, whereas `test` by itself checks if `test` is truthy.

DONE.
