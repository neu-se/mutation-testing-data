  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would close the read stream immediately, whereas `destroy()` would wait for any pending data to be flushed before closing the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.pause();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pause()` would temporarily suspend reading from the stream, whereas `destroy()` would close the stream immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.unpipe();
```
This would result in different behavior because `unpipe()` would detach the read stream from the write stream, whereas `destroy()` would close the read stream immediately.

DONE.
