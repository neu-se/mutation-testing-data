  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - r
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function is used to calculate the arccosine of a value between -1 and 1, while the `1 - r` expression would calculate the arccosine of a value between 0 and 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function is used to calculate the arccosine of a value between -1 and 1, while the `r * 2` expression would calculate the arccosine of a value between 0 and 4.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function is used to calculate the arccosine of a value between -1 and 1, while the `r / 2` expression would calculate the arccosine of a value between 0 and
