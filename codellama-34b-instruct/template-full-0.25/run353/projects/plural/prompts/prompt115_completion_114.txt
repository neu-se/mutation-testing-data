  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.push('coronavirus')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only adds the word "illnesses" to the list of words that should be pluralized, while this new code fragment adds a new word to the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only adds the word "illnesses" to the list of words that should be pluralized, while this new code fragment removes the first word from the list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses = ['coronavirus']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only adds the word "illnesses" to the list of words that should be pluralized, while this new code fragment replaces the list with a new list containing only the word "coronavirus".
