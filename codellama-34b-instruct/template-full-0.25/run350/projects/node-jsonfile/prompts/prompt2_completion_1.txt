  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function, whereas `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function. Using `fs.readFileSync` would cause the code to block until the file is read, which could lead to performance issues and deadlocks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is set to `'utf8'`, which would cause the file to be read as a UTF-8 encoded string, whereas the original code fragment did not specify an encoding. This could lead to differences in the way the file is read and parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile, { throws: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because
