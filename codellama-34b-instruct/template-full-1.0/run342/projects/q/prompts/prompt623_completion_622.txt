  Sure, here are three potential options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key + value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `key` and `value` arguments, rather than setting the `value` property of the `key` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the `value` argument by 2, rather than setting the `value` property of the `key` object to the original `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, Q(value)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(value)` function would create a new promise that is resolved with the `value` argument, rather than setting the `value` property of the `key` object to the original `value`.
