  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a different operation than `op.delete`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a different operation than `op.delete`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` instead of `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain(0)` is a different operation than `op.delete`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

DONE.
