  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different return values, and the code relies on the correct calculation of the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.cos` have different return values, and the code relies on the correct calculation of the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and the code relies on the correct calculation of the cosine.

DONE.
