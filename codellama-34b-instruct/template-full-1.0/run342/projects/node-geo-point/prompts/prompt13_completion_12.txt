  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the array has exactly 2 elements, while this new code checks if the array has less than 2 elements. If the array has exactly 2 elements, the new code would evaluate to `false`, while the original code would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the array has exactly 2 elements, while this new code checks if the array has more than 2 elements. If the array has exactly 2 elements, the new code would evaluate to `false`, while the original code would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.coordinates.hasOwnProperty('length') || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `point.
