  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument of the `args` array as the second argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument of the `args` array as the second argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a new array containing all elements of the `args` array except the first one as the second argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

DONE.
