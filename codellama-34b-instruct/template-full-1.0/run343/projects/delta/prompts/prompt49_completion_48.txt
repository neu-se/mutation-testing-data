  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the properties of the given object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.entries` returns an array of the given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.hasOwnProperty` checks if the object has a property with the given key. 

DONE.
