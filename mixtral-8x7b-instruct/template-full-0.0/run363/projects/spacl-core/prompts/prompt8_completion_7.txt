 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
spec.match('//') !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the exact string '//' instead of a regex pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new RegExp('//').test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it tests if the '//' pattern exists in the spec string instead of using the `match` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/^\/$/.test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the spec string is exactly '/' instead of using the `match` method.

DONE.
