Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.floor` rounds down, potentially changing the index used in the `quantileSelect` function and affecting the quantile calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[l] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `indices[l]` shifts the starting index of the `quantileSelect` function, potentially changing the range of elements considered for the quantile calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
r
```
This would result in different behavior because using `r` (the right index) instead of `indices[l]` as the starting index for the `quantileSelect` function could lead to incorrect or out-of-bounds indexing, affecting the quantile calculation.

DONE.
