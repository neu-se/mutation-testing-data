  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the word minus 2, rather than the length minus 1, which would cause the logic for the special case of "cherry" to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the word plus 1, rather than the length minus 1, which would cause the logic for the special case of "cherry" to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 0, which would cause the logic for the special case of "cherry" to be incorrect.

Please note that these are just a few examples of the many possible variations that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the code. DONE.
