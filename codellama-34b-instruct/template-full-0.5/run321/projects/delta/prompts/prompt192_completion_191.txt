  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the iterator has a next element, while this new code fragment checks if the next element is a delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext() && delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1] !== newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the iterator has a next element and if the last operation in the delta is equal to the new operation, while this new code fragment checks if the iterator has a next element and if the last operation in the delta is not equal to the new operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the iterator has a next element, while this new code fragment checks if the next element has a length greater than zero.
