  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!hasStacks && typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only enable long stack traces if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks || typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enable long stack traces if `hasStacks` is true, or if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks && typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only enable long stack traces if both `hasStacks` is true and the `Q_
