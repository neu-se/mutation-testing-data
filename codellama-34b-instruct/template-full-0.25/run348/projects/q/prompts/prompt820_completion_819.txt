  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been reversed, causing the `rejected` callback to be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument `void 0` has been added to the end of the argument list, which would cause the `progress` callback to be called with an additional argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` callback has been removed from the argument list, causing it to not be called at all.

DONE.
