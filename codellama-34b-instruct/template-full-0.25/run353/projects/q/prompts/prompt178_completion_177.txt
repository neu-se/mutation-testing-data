  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number is different, and the error message would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:100"
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number is different, and the error message would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:1000"
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number is different, and the error message would be different.

DONE.
