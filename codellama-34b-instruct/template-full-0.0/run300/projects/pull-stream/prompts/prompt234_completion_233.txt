  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `data`, which would cause the test to fail if the value of `data` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.length` would return the length of the `data` array, which would cause the test to fail if the value of `data` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `data[0]` would return the first element of the `data` array, which would cause the test to fail if the value of `data` is not an array or if the first element is not a number.

DONE.
