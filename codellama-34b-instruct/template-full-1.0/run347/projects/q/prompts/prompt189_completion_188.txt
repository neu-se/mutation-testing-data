  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because `String` is a different data type than `Number`, and would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `length` property of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `undefined`, and would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `length` property of a `null` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a different value than `undefined`, and would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `length` property of an object that is not a function.

DONE.
