  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method would not throw an error if the argument is null, as it would in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method would not throw an error if the argument is undefined, as it would in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method would not throw an error if the argument is an empty string, as it would in the original code.

DONE.
