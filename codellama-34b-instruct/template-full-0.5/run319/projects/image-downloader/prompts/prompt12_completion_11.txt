  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` returns the entire pathname, while `pathname.substring(1)` returns the pathname without the first character. This change could potentially cause the code to fail if the first character of the pathname is important.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` returns the entire pathname, while `pathname.toLowerCase()` returns the pathname in lowercase. This change could potentially cause the code to fail if the case of the pathname is important.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` returns the entire pathname, while `pathname.split('/')[0]` returns the first component of the pathname. This change could potentially
