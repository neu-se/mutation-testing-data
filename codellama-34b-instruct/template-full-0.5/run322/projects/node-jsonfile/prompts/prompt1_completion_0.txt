  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `options` argument is a string, while the new code checks if it is not a string. This could cause the function to behave differently if the `options` argument is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `options` argument is a string, while the new code checks if it is null. This could cause the function to behave differently if the `options` argument is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `options` argument is an object, while the new code checks if it is not an object. This could cause the function to behave differently if the `options` argument is not an object.

DONE.
