  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array instead of an array containing the function's arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array containing `undefined` instead of an array containing the function's arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array containing only the first argument (the function itself) instead of an array containing all the function's arguments.

DONE.
