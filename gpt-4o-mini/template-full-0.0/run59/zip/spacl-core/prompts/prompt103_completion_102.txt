Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx` parameter is omitted, which may lead to incorrect policy evaluations that depend on context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, 'GET', ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` is hardcoded to 'GET', which means that the query will only check for permissions related to the 'GET' action, ignoring any other verbs that might be relevant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, path, verb, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` of the policy is incorrectly passed as the first argument to the policy's `query` method, which may lead to unexpected results since the method is likely expecting a different parameter structure.

DONE.
