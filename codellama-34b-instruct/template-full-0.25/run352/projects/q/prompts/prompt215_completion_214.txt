  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value, whereas the original code fragment would simply return the value as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value by 2, whereas the original code fragment would simply return the value as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the value, whereas the original code fragment would simply return the value as is.

DONE.
