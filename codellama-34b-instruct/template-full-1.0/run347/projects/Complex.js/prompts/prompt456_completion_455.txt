  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `true` for non-zero numbers that happen to have a real part equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof this['re'] === 'number' && typeof this['im'] === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `true` for non-numeric inputs, such as objects or strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isNaN(this['re']) && !Number.isNaN(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `false` for numbers that contain `NaN` elements.

DONE.
