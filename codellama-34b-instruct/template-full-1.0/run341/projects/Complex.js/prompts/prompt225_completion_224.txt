  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition from checking if b is equal to 0 to checking if b is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition from checking if b is equal to 0 to checking if b is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition from checking if b is equal to 0 to checking if b is less than -1.

DONE.
