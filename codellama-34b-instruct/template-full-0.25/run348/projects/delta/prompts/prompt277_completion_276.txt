  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next` would return the next operation in the iterator, whereas `iter.peek` would return the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekLength() + 1` would return the length of the current operation plus one, whereas `iter.peekLength()` would return the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType()` would return the type of the current operation, whereas `iter.peek` would return the current operation.

DONE.
