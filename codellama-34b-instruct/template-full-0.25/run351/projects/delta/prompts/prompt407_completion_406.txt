  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` parameter is negated, which would cause the transform function to behave differently when `priority` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(otherData[embedType], thisData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to the `transform` function is reversed, which would cause the function to behave differently when `priority` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` parameter is passed to the `transform` function, which would cause the function to behave differently when `priority` is true.

DONE.
