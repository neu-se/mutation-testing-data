  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the `baseOp` object, while the buggy code fragment would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the `baseOp` object, while the buggy code fragment would return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the `baseOp` object, while the buggy code fragment would return `true`.

DONE.
