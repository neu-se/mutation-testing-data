  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp` is an `Op` object, and `Op.length()` returns the length of the operation, which is not necessarily the same as the length of the retained text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp` is an `Op` object, and `Op.length()` returns the length of the operation, which is not necessarily the same as the length of the retained text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(thisOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is the number of characters to retain, which may not be the same as the length of the retained text.

DONE.
