  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ? 1 : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator is used to return a boolean value instead of the actual value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root function is used instead of the actual value of `a`

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the absolute value function is used instead of the actual value of `a`

DONE.
