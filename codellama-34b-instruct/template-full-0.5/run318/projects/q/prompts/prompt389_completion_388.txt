  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be deferred instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be undefined instead of fulfilled.

DONE.
