  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, which is the opposite of what `Q.resolve` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.notify` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the `progress` parameter, which is different from the value of the `value` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fulfill` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the `value` parameter, which is different from the value of the `value` parameter.

DONE.
