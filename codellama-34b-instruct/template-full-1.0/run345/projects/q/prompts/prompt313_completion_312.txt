  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and not a function, so the program would throw an error if it tries to call the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a primitive value and not a function, so the program would throw an error if it tries to call the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and not a function, so the program would throw an error if it tries to call the function.

DONE.
