  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a reason for the rejection, and passing `null` would not provide any information about the reason for the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a reason for the rejection, and passing `undefined` would not provide any information about the reason for the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a reason for the rejection, and passing a string would not provide any information about the reason for the rejection.

DONE.
