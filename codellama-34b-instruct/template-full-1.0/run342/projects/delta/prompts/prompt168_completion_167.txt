  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method called on the op returned by `thisIter.next()` would mutate the op and cause it to have a different effect on the document. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.next()` method would return an op from the other delta, leading to different behavior in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const op = thisIter.next();
op.length = null;
return op;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the op returned by `thisIter.next()` would be set to null which would cause the op to have no effect on the document.

DONE.
