  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('').slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the string into individual characters instead of splitting it by the '/' character, which would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(0).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the array from index 0 instead of index 1, which would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the array elements back together into a single string after reversing them, which would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
