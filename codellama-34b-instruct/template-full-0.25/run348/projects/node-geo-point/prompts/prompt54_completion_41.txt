  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has a different output than the `cos` function, and would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.random()` function returns a random number between 0 and 1, and would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a random value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1 / 0` operation would cause a division by zero error, and would cause the `calculateBearing` method to throw an error.

DONE.
