Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `data` by adding 1 to it, which changes the output from the original value of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the output with `undefined`, which means nothing will be logged to the console, unlike the original code that logs the actual `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts `data` to a string representation, which may not match the original type or format of `data`, potentially leading to unexpected output.

DONE.
