  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it removes the `i` flag at the end, which makes the regex case-sensitive. This means that the regex will only match the string "man" and not "Woman" or "woMan".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds the `i` flag at the end, which makes the regex case-insensitive. This means that the regex will match the string "man", "Woman", and "woMan".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/g
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds the `g` flag at the end, which makes the regex global. This means that the regex will match all occurrences of the string "man", "Woman",
