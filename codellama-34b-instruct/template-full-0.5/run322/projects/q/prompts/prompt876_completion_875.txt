  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `array_slice.call(args)` would return a shallow copy of the `args` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` would return a shallow copy of the `args` object, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(0)` would return a shallow copy of the `args` object starting from the first element, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
