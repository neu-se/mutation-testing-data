  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` is a function, and replacing it with `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` is a function, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` is a function, and replacing it with an empty function would not cause an error, but would also not execute the original code.

DONE.
