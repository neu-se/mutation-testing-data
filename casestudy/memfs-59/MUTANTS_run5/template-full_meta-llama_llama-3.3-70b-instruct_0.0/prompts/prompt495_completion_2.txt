Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!node.canWrite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node cannot be written to, instead of checking if it's a directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.isFile()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is a file, instead of checking if it's a directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always throws an error when trying to open a file, regardless of the node type or permissions.

DONE.
