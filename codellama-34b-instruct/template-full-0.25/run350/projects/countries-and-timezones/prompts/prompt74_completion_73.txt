  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the name of the timezone, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the name of the timezone to uppercase, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the name of the timezone, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.

DONE.
