Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `result[country]` is explicitly `null`, which would not account for the case where `result[country]` is `undefined`, leading to incorrect initialization of the timezone data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `result[country]` is defined, which would allow the code to skip the initialization step even if `result[country]` is not yet created, potentially causing runtime errors when trying to access properties on an undefined object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.keys(result).includes(country)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `country` is not a key in the `result` object, which could lead to incorrect behavior if `result` has been modified elsewhere in the code, potentially allowing for unexpected overwrites or omissions in the timezone data.

DONE.
