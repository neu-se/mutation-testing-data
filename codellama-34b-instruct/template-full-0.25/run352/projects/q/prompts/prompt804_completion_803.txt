  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a function, so it would not be invoked as a callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a function, so it would not be invoked as a callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}, function() {}, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the two anonymous functions would be invoked as callbacks, but they do not have any side effects, so the behavior would be different from the original code.

DONE.
