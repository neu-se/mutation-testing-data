  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!s
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of `s`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `s` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `s`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `s` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the `s` array, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `s` is a function.

DONE.
