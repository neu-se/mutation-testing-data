  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).done
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a method that is called when the promise is resolved, whereas `fail` is a method that is called when the promise is rejected. Using `done` instead of `fail` would cause the promise to be resolved even if the function being called with `Q.nfbind` throws an error, which would be a bug.

DONE.
