 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is immediately invoked as a function, instead of being passed as an argument to `abortCb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because a number is passed to `abortCb` instead of a function, which would likely cause an error in the `abortCb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` variable is passed to `abortCb` instead of `onAbort`, which would change the behavior of the function when an abort signal is received.

DONE.
