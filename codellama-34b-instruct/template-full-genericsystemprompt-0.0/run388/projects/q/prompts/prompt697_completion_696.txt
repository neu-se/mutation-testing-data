  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument, which is the `object` parameter, and would pass the remaining arguments to the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first two arguments, which are the `object` and `name` parameters, and would pass the remaining arguments to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first three arguments, which are the `object`, `name`, and `args` parameters, and would pass the remaining arguments to the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
