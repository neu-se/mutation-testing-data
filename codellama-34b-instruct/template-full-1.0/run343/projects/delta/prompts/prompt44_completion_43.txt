  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `a` was not an object or null, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is an object and not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && typeof a === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `a` was not an object or null, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is truthy and an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `a` was not an object or null, while this new code fragment checks if `a` has at least one key.

DONE.
