 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` is the correct global object to use, while `object_keys` is a made-up name that would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.ownKeys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Reflect.ownKeys` returns an array of all own keys on the object, including symbol keys, while `Object.keys` only returns the enumerable string keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array of only the own enumerable and non-enumerable string keys of the object, while `Object.keys` only returns the enumerable string keys.

DONE.
