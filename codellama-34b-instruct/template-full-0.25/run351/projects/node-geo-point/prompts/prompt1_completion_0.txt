  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === NaN || longitude === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the latitude and longitude are not numbers, while this code fragment checks if they are specifically NaN (Not a Number).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === null || longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the latitude and longitude are not numbers, while this code fragment checks if they are specifically null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === undefined || longitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the latitude and longitude are not numbers, while this code fragment checks if they are specifically undefined.

DONE.
