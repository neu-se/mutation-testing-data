  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `resolver` is not a string "function", which is not the same as checking if it is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolver !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `resolver` is not an object, which is not the same as checking if it is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.constructor !== Function
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `resolver` is not an instance of the `Function` constructor, which is not the same as checking if it is not a function.

DONE.
