  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (row.val === undefined) {
  delete this._data[row.key]; // delete operator instead of .delete method
} else {
  this._data[row.key] = row.val; // object property assignment instead of .set method
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator does not remove the property from the object's prototype, whereas the `.delete` method does. The `delete` operator also returns a boolean indicating whether the deletion was successful, whereas the `.delete` method returns the deleted value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (row.val === undefined) {
  this._data.prop(row.key); // property access syntax instead of .get method
} else {
  this._data[row.key] = row.val; // object property assignment instead of .set method
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the property access syntax `.prop` does not invoke the property's getter or setter,
