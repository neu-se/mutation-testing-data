  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.url` is a string, and `parse` expects a URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.url.parse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.url` is a string, and `parse` is not a method of the string object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(linkurl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` expects a string, and `linkurl.url` is a URL object.

DONE.
