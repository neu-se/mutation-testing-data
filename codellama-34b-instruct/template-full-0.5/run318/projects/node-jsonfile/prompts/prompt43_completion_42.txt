  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but `obj + 1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"obj"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but `"obj"` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but `null` is a null value.

DONE.
