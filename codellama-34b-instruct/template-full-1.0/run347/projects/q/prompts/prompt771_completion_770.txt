  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promises).allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` will return a promise that is already resolved, whereas the original code `Q(promises).allSettled` returns a promise that is still pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promises).allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will return a promise that is already rejected, whereas the original code `Q(promises).allSettled` returns a promise that is still pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promises).allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` will return a promise that is resolved or rejected based on the state of the `promises` object, whereas the original code `Q(promises).allSettled` returns a promise that is still pending.
