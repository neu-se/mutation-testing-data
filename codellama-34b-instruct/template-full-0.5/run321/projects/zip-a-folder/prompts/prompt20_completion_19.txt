  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` flag opens the file in append mode, which would cause the archive to be appended to the file instead of overwriting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'w' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `w` flag opens the file in write mode, which would cause the archive to be written to the file instead of appended to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'x' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `x` flag opens the file in exclusive mode, which would cause the archive to be written to the file only if it does not already exist. If the file already exists, the operation would fail.

DONE.
