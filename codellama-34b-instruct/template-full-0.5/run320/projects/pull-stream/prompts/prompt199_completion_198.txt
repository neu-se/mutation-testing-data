  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` function to be called with an error object, but `null` would not be considered an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` function to be called with an error object, but `undefined` would not be considered an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('abort')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` function to be called with an error object, but `new Error('abort')` would be considered an error.

DONE.
