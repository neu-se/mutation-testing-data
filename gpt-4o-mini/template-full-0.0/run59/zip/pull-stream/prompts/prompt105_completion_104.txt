Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different type than `null`, which may lead to unexpected results in the `drain` function if it checks for specific values or types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `true` instead of `null` may change the logic within the `drain` function, potentially causing it to behave differently if it interprets the boolean value in a specific way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is a truthy value, which could alter the flow of the `drain` function if it expects a falsy value like `null` to trigger certain conditions.

DONE.
