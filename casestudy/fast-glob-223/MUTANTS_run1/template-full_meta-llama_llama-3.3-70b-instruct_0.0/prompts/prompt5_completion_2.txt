Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ strict: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `strict` option in `isGlob` changes how it handles certain patterns, so setting it to `true` instead of `false` could lead to different results in the `isDynamicPattern` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty options object might have different default settings than the original `{ strict: false }`, potentially affecting how `isGlob` evaluates patterns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the options to `isGlob` could cause it to throw an error or behave unpredictably, unlike the original code which expects an options object.

DONE.
