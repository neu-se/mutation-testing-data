  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property has more than two elements, instead of checking if it has two elements. This change would cause the method to throw a `TypeError` for any input that has a `coordinates` property with more than two elements, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property has exactly two elements, instead of checking if it has more than two elements. This change would cause the method to throw a `TypeError` for any input that has a `coordinates` property with exactly two elements, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it
