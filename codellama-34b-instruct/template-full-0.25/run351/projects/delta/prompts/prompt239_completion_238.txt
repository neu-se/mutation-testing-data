  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the length of the string is greater than 0, while the modified code fragment is checking if the length of the string is greater than or equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the length of the string is greater than 0, while the modified code fragment is checking if the length of the string is less than or equal to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the length of the string is greater than 0, while the modified code fragment is checking if the length of the string is greater than or equal to 2.

DONE.
