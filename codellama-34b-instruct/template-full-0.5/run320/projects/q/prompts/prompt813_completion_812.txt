  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `this`, while the replaced code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `this`, while the replaced code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `this`, while the replaced code fragment returns a promise that is rejected with an error.

DONE.
