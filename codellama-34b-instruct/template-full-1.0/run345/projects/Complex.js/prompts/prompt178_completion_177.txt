  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to the number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.round` returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.sqrt` returns the positive square root of a number.

DONE.
