 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because a empty function would not have the same effect as setTimeout with 0 delay, which is used to schedule the flush function to be executed in the next event loop iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a "TypeError: undefined is not a function" when requestTick is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
alert
```
This would result in different behavior because alert is a synchronous function and it would block the event loop, preventing flush from being called in the next iteration.

DONE.
