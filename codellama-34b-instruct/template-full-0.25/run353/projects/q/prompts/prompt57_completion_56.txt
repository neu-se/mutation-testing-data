  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function call, while `flush` is a reference to the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush.call()` is a function call with an explicit `this` value of `flush`, while `flush` is a reference to the function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush.apply()` is a function call with an explicit `this` value of `flush`, while `flush` is a reference to the function itself.

DONE.
