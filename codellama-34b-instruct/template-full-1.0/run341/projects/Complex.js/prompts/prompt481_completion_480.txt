  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['im'] === 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is being checked for strict equality against 1 instead of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['im'] === -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is being checked for strict equality against -1 instead of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['im'] > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is being checked to see if it is greater than 0 instead of checking for exact equality to 0.

DONE.
