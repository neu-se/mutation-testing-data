 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
() => zipArchive.finalize()
```
This would result in different behavior because the finalize function would be called immediately, without waiting for the data to be fully written to the output stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive.finalize()
```
This would result in different behavior because the finalize function would be called synchronously, instead of being queued in the event loop for later execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
() => zipArchive.finalize().catch(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because any errors that occur during the finalization process would be silently swallowed, potentially hiding important issues.

DONE.
