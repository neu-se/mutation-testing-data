  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `updater` function to be called with the value of the key, rather than the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `updater` function to be called with the value of the key and the value of the `val` parameter, rather than just the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key, val, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `updater` function to be called with the value of the key, the value of the `val` parameter, and the value of the `cb` parameter, rather than just the key.

DONE.
