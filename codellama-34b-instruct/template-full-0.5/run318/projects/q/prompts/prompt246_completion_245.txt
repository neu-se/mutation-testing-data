  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will return `true` if either `Q.longStackSupport` or `hasStacks` is truthy, whereas the `&&` operator requires both operands to be truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will negate the value of `hasStacks`, so the expression will only be truthy if `Q.longStackSupport` is truthy and `hasStacks` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will return `true` if either `Q.longStackSupport` or `!hasStacks` is truthy, whereas the `&&` operator requires both operands to be
