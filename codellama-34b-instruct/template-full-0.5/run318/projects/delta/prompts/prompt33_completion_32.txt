  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] === base[key] && base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code, causing the `baseInverted` object to always be empty, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition of the `if` statement, causing the `baseInverted` object to always be non-empty, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] === base[key] && base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code and also change the condition of the `if` statement, causing the `baseInverted` object to always be non-empty and have the same values as the `attr` object, regardless
