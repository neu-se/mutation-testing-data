  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the "get" method, regardless of the value of the "op" parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the "set" method, regardless of the value of the "op" parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the "delete" method, regardless of the value of the "op" parameter.

DONE.
