  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would no longer be called, and the `unhandledRejections` array would not be updated, which could cause unhandled rejections to be lost or missed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called, but the `unhandledRejections` array would not be updated, which could cause unhandled rejections to be lost or missed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called, but the `unhandledRejections` array would not be updated, which could cause unhandled rejections to be lost or missed.

DONE.
