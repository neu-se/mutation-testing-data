  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, and the unhandled rejection would not be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with an invalid index, and the unhandled rejection would not be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with an index that is out of bounds, and the unhandled rejection would not be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
