  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the arguments `(err, data)`, while `null` is a constant value that does not have a `data` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the arguments `(err, data)`, while `undefined` is a constant value that does not have a `data` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the arguments `(err, data)`, while `function () {}` is a function that does not have any arguments.

DONE.
