Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the `callback` function would cause the promise to fail immediately, as `null` is not a valid function to invoke.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of the `callback` function would lead to a similar failure as with `null`, resulting in an error when trying to call `undefined` as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Intentional Error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the `callback` with a function that throws an error would cause the promise to reject immediately with the specified error, rather than executing the intended callback logic.

DONE.
