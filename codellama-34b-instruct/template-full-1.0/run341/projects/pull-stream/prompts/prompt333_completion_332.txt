  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a function that is not defined in the original code, and it would cause the program to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a variable that is defined in the original code, but it is not used in the same way as the original code fragment. In the original code, `data` is used as an argument to the callback function `cb`, but in the modified code, it is used as a standalone variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd` is a function that is defined in the original code, but it is not called with the same arguments as in the original code. In the original code, `onEnd` is called with two arguments, `end` and `data`, but in the modified code, it is called with only one
