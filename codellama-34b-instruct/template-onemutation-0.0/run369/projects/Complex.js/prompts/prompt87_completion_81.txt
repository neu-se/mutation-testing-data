  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is `NaN`, while the `!isNaN` operator checks if a value is not `NaN`. In this case, the `!isNaN` operator would always return `true`, even if the value is `NaN`, which would cause the code to behave differently than the original code.

DONE.
