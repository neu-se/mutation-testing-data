  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, whereas replacing it with `null` would result in a `TypeError` when trying to access the `latitude` and `longitude` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, whereas replacing it with `undefined` would result in a `TypeError` when trying to access the `latitude` and `longitude` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, whereas replacing it with an empty object `{}` would result in a `TypeError` when trying to access the `latitude` and `longitude` properties.

DONE.
