  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function (resolve, reject) => {
               reject("new reason");
            });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the reason for the rejection in the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(resolve) => {
               resolve("new value");
            });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the resolution in the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(reason) => {
               throw reason;
            });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error on rejection.

DONE.
