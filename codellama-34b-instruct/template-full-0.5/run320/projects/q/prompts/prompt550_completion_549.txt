  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a promise for the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a resolved promise, whereas `Q` returns a promise for the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when()` returns a promise for the resolved value, whereas `Q` returns the resolved value.

DONE.
