 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` directly applies the given arguments to the target function, bypassing the promise chain. This could cause issues if the target function is asynchronous or has side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.thenThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenThrow` creates a new promise that is immediately rejected with the given reason. This would disrupt the normal flow of the promise chain and cause any following `then` or `catch` handlers to execute prematurely or not at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` creates a new promise that is resolved when all of the given promises are resolved. If the target promise is not part of a list of promises, this would cause the resulting promise to wait indefinitely and never resolve.

DONE.
