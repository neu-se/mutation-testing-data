  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the `window` object is a function, which would likely always return `false`, causing the `if` statement to not execute the contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the `window` object is `undefined`, which would likely always return `false`, causing the `if` statement to execute the contents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof Q === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the `Q` object is `undefined`, which would likely always return `true`, causing the `if` statement to execute the contents.

DONE.
