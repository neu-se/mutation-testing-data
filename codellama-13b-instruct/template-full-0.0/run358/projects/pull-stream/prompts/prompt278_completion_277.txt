  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper = prop(mapper)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is now being called with the `prop` function as an argument, which would cause the `mapper` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper = prop(mapper)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is now being called with the `prop` function as an argument, which would cause the `mapper` function to return a different value.
