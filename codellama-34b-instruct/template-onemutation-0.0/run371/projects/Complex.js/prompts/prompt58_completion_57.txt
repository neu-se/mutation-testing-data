  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a['r']) || Number.isFinite(a['phi'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator `&&`, which requires both conditions to be true, while the new code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||`, which only requires one condition to be true. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if only one of the conditions is true, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
