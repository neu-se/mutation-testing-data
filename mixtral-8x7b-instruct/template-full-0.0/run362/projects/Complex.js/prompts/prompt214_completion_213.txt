 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the denominator in the `logHypot` function would be 0 when `b` is 0, causing a division by zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the denominator in the `logHypot` function, potentially leading to different results when `b` is not equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the sign of `b` in the `logHypot` function, potentially leading to different results when `b` is negative.

DONE.
