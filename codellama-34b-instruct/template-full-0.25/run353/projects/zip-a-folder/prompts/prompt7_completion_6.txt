  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of the original `targetFilePath`, which could cause the program to write to a different file than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'foo' to the original `targetFilePath`, which could cause the program to write to a different file than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the original `targetFilePath` to uppercase, which could cause the program to write to a different file than expected if the file system is case-sensitive.

DONE.
