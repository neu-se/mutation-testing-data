  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the first point instead of the second point, which could lead to a different bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 10 degrees to the latitude of the second point, which could lead to a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of PI/2 (90 degrees) instead of the latitude of the second point, which could lead to a different bearing calculation.

DONE.
