  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 1000000000 && b < 1000000000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition only considers values less than 3000, while this replacement considers values less than 1000000000, which would cause the code to take a different execution path in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < b && b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if both values are less than 3000, while this replacement only checks if the first value is less than the second value, and then checks if the second value is less than 3000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < b && b < a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if the first value is less than the second value, while this replacement
