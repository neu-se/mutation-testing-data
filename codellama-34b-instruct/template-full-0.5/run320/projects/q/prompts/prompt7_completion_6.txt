  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now throw an error instead of returning a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return "This is a buggy code fragment";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return a string instead of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return undefined instead of a value.

DONE.
