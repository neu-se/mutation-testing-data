  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, "id"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a variable `id` as the second argument to the `buildCountry` function, while the replaced code fragment uses a string literal `"id"`. This could potentially cause the `buildCountry` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a variable `id` as the second argument to the `buildCountry` function, while the replaced code fragment uses the result of adding 1 to the `id` variable. This could potentially cause the `buildCountry` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a variable `id` as the second argument to the `buildCountry` function, while the replaced code
