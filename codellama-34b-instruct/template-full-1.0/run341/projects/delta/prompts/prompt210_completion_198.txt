  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a method that mutates the original array, whereas `slice` is a method that returns a new array. In this specific context, using `splice` would modify the original `ops` array, which could lead to unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that returns a new array, whereas `slice` is a method that returns a new array with the same elements as the original. In this specific context, using `concat` would return a new array with the same elements as `this.ops`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` is a method that returns a new array with only the elements that meet the conditions specified in the callback function. In
