 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'href' in el && el['href']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'href' property exists in the 'el' object and uses it, instead of directly accessing 'href' property which might result in undefined if it doesn't exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(el).attr('data-href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the 'data-href' attribute instead of 'href', which might result in different values or errors if the attribute doesn't exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
el.getAttribute('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the native 'getAttribute' method to retrieve the 'href' attribute, which might return different values or errors compared to the jQuery 'attr' method.

DONE.
