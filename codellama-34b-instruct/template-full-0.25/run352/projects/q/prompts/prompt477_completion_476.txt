  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the `unhandledRejections` array, potentially causing unhandled rejections to be missed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `unhandledReasons` array, potentially causing unhandled reasons to be missed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two elements of the `unhandledRejections` array, potentially causing unhandled rejections to be missed.

DONE.
