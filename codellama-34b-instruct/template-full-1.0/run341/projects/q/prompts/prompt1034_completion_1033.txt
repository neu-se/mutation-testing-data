  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `captureLine - 1`
This would result in different behavior because the line number would be decremented by one, which would cause the stack trace to point to the wrong line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `captureLine * 2`
This would result in different behavior because the line number would be doubled, which would cause the stack trace to point to a non-existent line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `captureLine + 100`
This would result in different behavior because the line number would be increased by 100, which would cause the stack trace to point to a line that is not part of the Q function.

DONE.
