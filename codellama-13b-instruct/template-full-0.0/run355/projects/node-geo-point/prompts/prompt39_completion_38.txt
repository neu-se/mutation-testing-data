  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of the angle between two points, while the new code fragment calculates the sum of the two angles.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of the angle between two points, while the new code fragment calculates the difference between the two angles.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of the angle between two points, while the new code fragment calculates the product of the two angles.

DONE.
