Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly combines the `path` and `ctx` variables as a string, which would always evaluate to `true` if both are non-empty, leading to incorrect permission checks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the `path` variable entirely, meaning the rule would only check if the `verb` exists in `this.verbs` without considering whether the `ctx` matches the `path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it evaluates the length of the `path` string instead of checking if the `path` matches the regex, which would always return `true` for non-empty paths, potentially allowing actions that should be denied.

DONE.
