  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking that the PLACEHOLDER was not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking that the PLACEHOLDER was not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking that the PLACEHOLDER was not an empty string.

DONE.
