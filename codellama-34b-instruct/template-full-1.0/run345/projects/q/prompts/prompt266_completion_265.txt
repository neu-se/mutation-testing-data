  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise = resolvedPromise;
```
This would result in an infinite loop, as the `resolvedPromise` property is being set to itself, causing the `resolve` function to never return.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise = "string";
```
This would result in the `join` function returning a rejected promise, as the `resolvedPromise` property is being set to a string value, which is not the same as the original promise value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise = Q.reject();
```
This would result in the `join` function returning a rejected promise, as the `resolvedPromise` property is being set to a rejected promise.

DONE.
