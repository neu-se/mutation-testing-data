  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL starts with a protocol, while 'https://' would ensure that the URL starts with a secure protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL starts with a protocol, while 'ftp://' would ensure that the URL starts with a protocol for transferring files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL starts with a protocol, while 'file://' would ensure that the URL starts with a protocol for accessing local files.

DONE.
