  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key in object
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_hasOwnProperty` is a method that checks if an object has a property with a given key, while the code fragment `key in object` is a shorthand for `object.hasOwnProperty(key)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty(key) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks if the object has the property with the given key and returns `true` or `false` instead of returning the key like the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(object).indexOf(key) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property with the given key is an own property of the object, and returns `true` or `false` instead of returning the key like the original code.

DONE.
