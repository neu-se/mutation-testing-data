  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback` is a function that handles errors, whereas `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `errback` instead of `callback` would cause the code to handle errors differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects a promise, whereas `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `reject` instead of `callback` would cause the code to handle errors differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a keyword that throws an exception, whereas `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `throw` instead of `callback` would cause the code to handle errors differently.

DONE.
