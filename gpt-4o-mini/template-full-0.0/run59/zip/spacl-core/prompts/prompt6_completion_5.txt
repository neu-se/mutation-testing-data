Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string, including those that do not start with a slash, thus allowing invalid paths to pass through without throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/.*\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it requires the path to start and end with a slash, which is not a valid requirement for paths that should only start with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it restricts the path to only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores after the initial slash, disallowing valid paths that may contain other characters.

DONE.
