  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tz.r` is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if it is not `undefined`. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `tz.r` is not `undefined`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tz.r` is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if it is `null`. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `tz.r` is `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tz.r` is `undefined`, while
