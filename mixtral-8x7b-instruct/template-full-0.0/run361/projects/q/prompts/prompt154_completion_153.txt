 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" From previous event:\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string concatenation operator `+` is changed to a space, which will alter the formatted output of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator string is changed to include a tab character, which will alter the formatted output of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + "New Separator" + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator string is changed to "New Separator", which will alter the formatted output of the stack trace.

DONE.
