  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if the length is strictly less than 0. This means that if the length is 0, the original code fragment would execute the `return this` statement, while this new code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if the length is greater than or equal to 0. This means that if the length is 0, the original code fragment would execute the `return this` statement, while this new code fragment would execute the `this.ops.push(newOp)` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the
