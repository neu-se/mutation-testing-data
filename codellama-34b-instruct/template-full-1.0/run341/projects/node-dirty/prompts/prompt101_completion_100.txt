  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val = undefined` is an assignment operator, which would change the value of `row.val` to `undefined`, whereas `row.val === undefined` is a comparison operator that checks if `row.val` is equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val !== undefined` is a comparison operator that checks if `row.val` is not equal to `undefined`, whereas `row.val === undefined` is a comparison operator that checks if `row.val` is equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val == undefined` is a loose comparison operator that checks if `row.val` is equal to `undefined` or is `undefined` itself, whereas `row.val === undefined`
