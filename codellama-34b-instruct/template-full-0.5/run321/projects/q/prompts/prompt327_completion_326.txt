  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0]` is a different value than `args`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[1]` is a different value than `args`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[2]` is a different value than `args`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
