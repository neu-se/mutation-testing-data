Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` does not modify the original string and returns a new string, whereas `replace` can modify the original string and returns the modified string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` splits a string into an array of substrings, whereas `replace` replaces a part of a string with another string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array containing the matched strings, whereas `replace` returns the modified string.

DONE.
