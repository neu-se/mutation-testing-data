Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to pipe the output of the zipArchive directly to the output stream, which is not the intended behavior since the original code uses `zipArchive.pipe` to connect the archive to the output stream, potentially leading to a runtime error if the output stream is not properly set up.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.append('data', { name: 'dummy.txt' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a dummy file named 'dummy.txt' with the content 'data' to the archive instead of piping the archive to the output stream, which would not create a valid zip or tar file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the second argument to `true` would include the directory structure in the archive, which may not be the intended behavior if the original code was meant to flatten the directory structure in the archive.

DONE.
