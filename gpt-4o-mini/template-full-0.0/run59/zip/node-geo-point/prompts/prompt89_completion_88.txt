Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation of the destination point to ignore the distance, effectively returning the original point instead of moving it based on the specified distance and bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the sine of the bearing angle instead of the cosine of the angular distance, leading to an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the cosine of the initial latitude instead of the cosine of the angular distance, which would distort the calculation of the destination point's longitude.

DONE.
