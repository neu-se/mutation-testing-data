  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `!` operator to check if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `timezonesMap` is strictly equal to `null`. If `timezonesMap` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or an empty string), the original code would still consider it to be "not set", while this new code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `!` operator to check if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `timezonesMap` has a length of 0. If `timezonesMap` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or an empty string), the original code would still consider it to be "not set", while this new code fragment would
