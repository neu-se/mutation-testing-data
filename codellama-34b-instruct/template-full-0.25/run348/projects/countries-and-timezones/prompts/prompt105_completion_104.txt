  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the timezone object to the `prev` object, while this modified code fragment adds the timezone object plus 1 to the `prev` object. This would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different result than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the timezone object to the `prev` object, while this modified code fragment adds the timezone object multiplied by 2 to the `prev` object. This would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different result than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
