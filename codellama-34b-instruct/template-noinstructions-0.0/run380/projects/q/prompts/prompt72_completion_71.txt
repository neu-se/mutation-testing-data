  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would continue to execute the `flush` function, while the mutated code fragment would throw an error and stop execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would continue to execute the `flush` function, while the mutated code fragment would return early and stop execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would continue to execute the `flush` function, while the mutated code fragment would return `undefined` and stop execution.

DONE.
