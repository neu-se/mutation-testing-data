  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled function is called when a promise is rejected, rather than the rejected function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejected function is called with a null reason, rather than the actual rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because the progressed function is called with the rejected function, rather than the actual progress value.

DONE.
