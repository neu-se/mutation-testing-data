 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with one argument instead of two, potentially causing the code that handles the callback to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an array is being passed to the callback instead of the expected `end` and `data` values. This could cause issues if the code that handles the callback is not designed to handle arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ end: data, data: end }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` and `data` values are being swapped, which could cause issues if the code that handles the callback is relying on these values being in a specific order or having specific properties.

DONE.
