  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the error is truthy, while the new code fragment always returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the error is truthy, while the new code fragment always returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the error is truthy, while the new code fragment always returns an error object.

DONE.
