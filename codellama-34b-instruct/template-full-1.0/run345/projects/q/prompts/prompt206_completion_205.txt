  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, but `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array, which is a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fileNameAndLineNumber.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `!fileNameAndLineNumber` is equivalent to `fileNameAndLineNumber.length == 0`, and `fileNameAndLineNumber.length` is the number of elements in the array, not the boolean value of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(fileNameAndLineNumber)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array, and `isNaN()` is only defined for numbers, so this would throw an error instead of returning a boolean value.

DONE.
