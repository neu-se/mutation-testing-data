  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be passed to the `post` method, whereas the original code fragment passes the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed to the `post` method, whereas the original code fragment passes the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be passed to the `post` method, whereas the original code fragment passes the `args` array.

DONE.
