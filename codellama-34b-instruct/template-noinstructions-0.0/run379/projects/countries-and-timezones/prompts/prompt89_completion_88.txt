  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return all timezones, including deprecated ones, instead of only returning non-deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return only non-deprecated timezones, instead of all timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return all timezones, including deprecated ones, if the `deprecated` option is set to `false`, and only non-deprecated timezones if the `deprecated` option is set to `true`.

DONE.
