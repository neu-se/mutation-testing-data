  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different property than `delete` and would not have the same effect on the program's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `otherOp.delete`, which would flip the conditional statement and change the program's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain ? 0 : 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `? :` operator would evaluate to `0` if `otherOp.retain` is truthy, and to `1` if it is falsy. This would change the value of the `length` variable and affect the program's behavior.

DONE.
