  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is parsing a JSON string, but the new code fragment is parsing a JSON string with all letters in uppercase. This could cause the JSON parser to throw an error or return a different result than expected.

DONE.
