```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This change will also cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a different value than the original code, and could potentially cause issues in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a different value than the original code, and could potentially cause issues in the application.

DONE.
