  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isFinite` is the negation of `isFinite`, which checks if a value is a finite number. Using `!isFinite` instead of `isFinite` would cause the code to consider non-finite numbers as valid, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a value is NaN (Not a Number), while `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number. Using `Number.isNaN` instead of `Number.isFinite` would cause the code to consider NaN values as valid, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.constructor.isFinite` checks if the value of `a` is
