  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the value of `op` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `op` is originally `true`, causing the `else` block to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` and the `else` block to never be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `else` block to never be executed.

DONE.
