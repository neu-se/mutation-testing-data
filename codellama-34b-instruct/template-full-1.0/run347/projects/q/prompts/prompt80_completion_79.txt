  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function that is already defined in the code, and it would be called immediately instead of being passed as an argument to `setTimeout()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function, and adding 1 to it would coerce it to a number, causing the `setTimeout()` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout()` takes a delay argument that specifies the number of milliseconds to wait before calling the function. Using `-1` as the delay would cause the function to be called immediately, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
