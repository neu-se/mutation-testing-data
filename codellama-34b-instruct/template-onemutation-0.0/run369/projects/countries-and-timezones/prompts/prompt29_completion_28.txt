  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides the offset by 60 to get the hours, while the new code fragment uses the modulo operator to get the minutes. This would cause the resulting offset string to be incorrect.

DONE.
