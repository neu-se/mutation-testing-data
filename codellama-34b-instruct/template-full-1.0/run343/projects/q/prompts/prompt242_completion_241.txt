  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
PROMISE
```
This would result in a different behavior because the code will reject the promise with the string "PROMISE", instead of resolving it with the value of `nearer(resolvedPromise)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in a different behavior because the code will resolve the promise with the value `null`, instead of resolving it with the value of `nearer(resolvedPromise)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("oops"))
```
This would result in a different behavior because the code will reject the promise with the error "oops", instead of resolving it with the value of `nearer(resolvedPromise)`.

DONE.
