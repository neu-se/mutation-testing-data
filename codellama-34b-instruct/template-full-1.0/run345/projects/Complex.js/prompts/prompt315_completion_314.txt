  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would be replaced with `cos`, which would cause the `tan` function to return a different value than it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Math.tan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would be replaced with `tan`, which would cause the `atan` function to return a different value than it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Math.acos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would be replaced with `acos`, which would cause the `asin` function to return a different value than it should.

DONE.
