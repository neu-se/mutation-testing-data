  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using `cos` on the latitude, we are using `cos` on the longitude. This would cause the calculation of `sinφ2` to produce a different value, potentially leading to the `acos` function returning a different value, and thus a different `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using `cos` on the longitude, we are using `cos` on the latitude. This would cause the calculation of `tanΔλ` to produce a different value, potentially leading to the `atan2` function returning a different value, and thus a different `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using `cos` on the longitude, we are using `sin` on the latitude. This would
