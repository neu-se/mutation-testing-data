  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an iterator over the keys of the map, while `values()` returns an iterator over the values of the map. In this case, the `extract` function is using the `values()` iterator to iterate over the values of the map and extract the URLs, so replacing it with `keys()` would cause the function to iterate over the keys instead, which would result in different behavior.
