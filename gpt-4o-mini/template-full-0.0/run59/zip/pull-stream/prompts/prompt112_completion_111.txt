Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from assigning the result of the reducer to `acc` to attempting to add `acc` and `data`, which may lead to unexpected results if `acc` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the `reducer` function entirely and assigns `data` directly to `acc`, which means the accumulated value will not be computed based on the reducer logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `acc` to `null` on every invocation, effectively discarding any previous accumulated value and preventing the reducer from functioning as intended.

DONE.
