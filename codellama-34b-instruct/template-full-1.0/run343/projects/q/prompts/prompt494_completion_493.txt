  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rate"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is expecting a function call with the `reason` argument, but passing the string `"rate"` will cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is expecting a function call with the `reason` argument, but passing `null` will cause a null pointer exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("oh no!")
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is expecting a function call with the `reason` argument, but passing a thrown error will cause the promise to be rejected with that error.

DONE.
