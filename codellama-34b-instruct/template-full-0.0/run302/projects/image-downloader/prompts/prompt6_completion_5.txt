  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is not required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the test case would not catch the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, and the test case would not catch the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the test case would not catch the error.

DONE.
