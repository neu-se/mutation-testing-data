  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.isInfinite() && !z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return NaN if both operands are infinite, while this new code would return the result of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite() || z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return NaN if either operand is infinite, while this new code would return the result of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.re !== 0 && z.re !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return NaN if either operand is zero, while this new code would return the result of the operation.

DONE.
