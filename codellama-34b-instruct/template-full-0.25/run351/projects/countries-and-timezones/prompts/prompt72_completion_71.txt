  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, { deprecated: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a deprecated timezone object, which may not be what the caller expects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, { deprecated: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a non-deprecated timezone object, which may not be what the caller expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a timezone object with no information about its deprecation status, which may not be what the caller expects.

DONE.
