  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would be called with the `fulfilled` callback instead of the `rejected` callback, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would be called with `undefined` as the second argument, which could lead to errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would be called with `null` as the second argument, which could lead to errors or unexpected results.

DONE.
