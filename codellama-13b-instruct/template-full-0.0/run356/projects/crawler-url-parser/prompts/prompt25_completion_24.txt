  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would not be called, and the `href` attribute would not be modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would be called, and the `href` attribute would be modified to include a hash symbol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would be called, and the `href` attribute would be modified to include the string "http://".

DONE.
