  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse`, which could cause issues if the JSON data contains functions or other non-JSON data types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || function(key, value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because a different `reviver` function is being passed to `JSON.parse`, which could cause issues if the JSON data contains functions or other non-JSON data types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || function(key, value) { return value * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is multiplying the value of each key by 2, which could cause issues if the JSON data contains
