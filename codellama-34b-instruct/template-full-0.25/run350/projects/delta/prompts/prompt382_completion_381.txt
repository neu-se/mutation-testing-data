  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by one more element than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by one fewer element than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance by twice as many elements as intended.

DONE.
