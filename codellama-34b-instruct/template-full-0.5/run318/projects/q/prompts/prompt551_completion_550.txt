  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the resulting promise to resolve to a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the resulting promise to resolve to a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the resulting promise to resolve to a different value than the original code.

DONE.
