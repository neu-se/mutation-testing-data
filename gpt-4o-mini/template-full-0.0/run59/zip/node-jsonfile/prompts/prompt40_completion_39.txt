Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the function used to wrap the `_writeFile` function from a promise-based approach to a callback-based approach, which may lead to different handling of asynchronous operations and error management.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original functionality with a promise that resolves immediately, bypassing the actual file writing operation and potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about the success of the write operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('Write failed') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original function with a function that always throws an error, simulating a failure in the write operation regardless of the input, which would affect error handling in the calling code.

DONE.
