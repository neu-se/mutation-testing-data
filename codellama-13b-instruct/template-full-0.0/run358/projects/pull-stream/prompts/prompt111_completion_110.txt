  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the `data` variable to be coerced into a number, and then incremented by 1. This would result in a different value being passed to the `reducer` function, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would cause the `data` variable to be coerced into a number, and then decremented by 1. This would result in a different value being passed to the `reducer` function, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would cause the `data` variable to be coerced into a number, and then multiplied by 2. This would result in a different value being passed
