  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a function, and `process.emit.apply` is a method that applies the function to a given `this` value and arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a function, and `process.emit.bind` is a method that creates a new function with a bound `this` value and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a function, and `process.emit.call` is a method that calls the function with a given `this` value and arguments.

DONE.
