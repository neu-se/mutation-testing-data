 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for both write and read permissions, while the original code only checks for read permission.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for execute permission, which is not relevant in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the file exists, regardless of permissions.

By introducing these changes, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite in detecting unexpected behavior caused by changes in permission checks. DONE.
