  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for `pop()` method of an array, causing an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for `pop()` method of an array, causing an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for `shift()` method of an array, causing an error to be thrown.

DONE.
