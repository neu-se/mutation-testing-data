  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an object is not always equal to 0, and the `Op.length` method is used to get the length of an operation, which is not necessarily equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an object is not always equal to 1, and the `Op.length` method is used to get the length of an operation, which is not necessarily equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an object is not always equal to `null`, and the `Op.length` method is used to get the length of an operation, which is not necessarily equal to `null`.

DONE.
