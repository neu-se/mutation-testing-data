  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not an array, and `array_slice` expects an array as its first argument. Using `arguments` directly would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would still be an array-like object, but the `array_slice` method would skip the first two elements, which could cause the wrong arguments to be passed to the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would still be an array-like object, but the `array_slice` method would skip the first three elements, which could cause the wrong arguments to be passed to the `promiseDispatch` method.
