  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method would return `false` instead of `true`, indicating that the complex number is not NaN, even if it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method would return `null` instead of `true`, indicating that the complex number is not NaN, even if it is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method would return `undefined` instead of `true`, indicating that the complex number is not NaN, even if it is.

DONE.
