  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.enter` is a different method than `domain.exit`, and would cause the domain to be entered again instead of exited.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit()` is a different method than `domain.exit`, and would cause the domain to be exited twice instead of once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit(1)` is a different method than `domain.exit`, and would cause the domain to be exited with a different argument than the original code.

DONE.
