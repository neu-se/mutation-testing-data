  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to advance further than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called on a different iterator, which would cause the iteration to start at a different index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `previous` method is called on a different iterator, which would cause the iteration to start at a different index and iterate in the opposite direction.

DONE.
