  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the buggy code fragment would add a rule for the word 'die' that maps it to the same form as the original word 'die', while the original code fragment would map 'die' to the plural form 'dice'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('dice', 'die')
```
This would result in different behavior because the buggy code fragment would add a rule for the word 'dice' that maps it to the same form as the original word 'die', while the original code fragment would map 'dice' to the plural form 'dice'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(die|dice)$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'ice' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the buggy code fragment would add a rule
