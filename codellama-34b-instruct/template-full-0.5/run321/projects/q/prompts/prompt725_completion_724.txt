  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `inspect` property of the `promise` object, rather than the `promise` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `promise` object contained in the `inspect` property of the `promise` object, rather than the `promise` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `state` property of the `inspect` property of the `promise` object, rather than the `promise` object itself.

DONE.
