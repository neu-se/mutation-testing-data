  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of `array_slice` is used to specify the end index of the slice, and by setting it to `2`, the resulting array would only contain the second argument of `Q.invoke`, which is the name of the method to invoke.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `array_slice` is used to specify the start index of the slice, and by setting it to `2`, the resulting array would only contain the third argument of `Q.invoke`, which is the array of invocation arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of `array_slice` is used to specify the end index of the slice,
