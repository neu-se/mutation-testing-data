  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb()` function is called immediately without waiting for the data to be persisted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is falsy, so the `if` statement that checks if `cb` is truthy will evaluate to `false`, causing the `cb()` function to not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `() => {}` arrow function is defined but not called, so the `cb()` function will not be executed.

DONE.
