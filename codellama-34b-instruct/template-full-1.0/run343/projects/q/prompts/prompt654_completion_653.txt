  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because producing an error message returned by Q.reject() would make the test fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q
```
This would result in different behavior because the ! operator would invert the returned promise, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.cancel("request has been cancelled")
```
This would result in different behavior because cancelling a request could change the behavior of the code and cause the test to fail.

DONE.
