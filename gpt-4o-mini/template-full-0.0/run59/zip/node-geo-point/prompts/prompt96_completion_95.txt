Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan` computes the arctangent of a single value, rather than the arctangent of two values (y and x), which is necessary for calculating the correct angle in polar coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan2(y + 1, x)
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `y` would artificially shift the angle, leading to incorrect bearing calculations that do not accurately reflect the true direction between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan2(y, x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `x` would distort the calculation of the angle, potentially resulting in an incorrect bearing that does not represent the actual relationship between the two geographic points.

DONE.
