  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, basename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the original URL-decoded basename of the file instead of the decoded basename with path separators removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the original URL pathname instead of the file's basename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, path.dirname(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the file's parent directory instead of the file's basename.

DONE.
