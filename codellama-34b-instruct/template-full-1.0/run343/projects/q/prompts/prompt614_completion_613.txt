  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise immediately, rather than waiting for a future turn.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.Promise.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise immediately, rather than waiting for a future turn.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q().get(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a promise that is resolved with the value of the given object, rather than waiting for a future turn.

DONE.
