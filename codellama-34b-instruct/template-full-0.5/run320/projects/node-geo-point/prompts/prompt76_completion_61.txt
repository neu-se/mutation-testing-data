  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor(θ)` would always round the bearing down to the nearest integer, while the original code fragment `Number(θ)` would convert the bearing to a number without rounding it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil(θ)` would always round the bearing up to the nearest integer, while the original code fragment `Number(θ)` would convert the bearing to a number without rounding it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round(θ)` would always round the bearing to the nearest integer, while the original code fragment `Number(θ)` would convert the bearing to a number without rounding it.

DONE.
