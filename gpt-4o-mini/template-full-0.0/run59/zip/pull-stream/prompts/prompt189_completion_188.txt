Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the index `i` instead of incrementing it, causing the function to return the same element repeatedly instead of moving to the next element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the next element in the array instead of the current one, potentially skipping elements and leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, array[i] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value returned by adding 1 to the current element, which changes the output and may lead to incorrect processing of the array values.

DONE.
