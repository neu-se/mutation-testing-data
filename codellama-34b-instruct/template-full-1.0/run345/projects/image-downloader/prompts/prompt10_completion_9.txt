  ```
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be using the `url` property of the `options` object instead of the `dest` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be using the lowercase version of the `dest` property, which could result in a different file path being constructed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be using the `split` method on the `dest` property, which could result in a different array of path components being constructed.

DONE.
