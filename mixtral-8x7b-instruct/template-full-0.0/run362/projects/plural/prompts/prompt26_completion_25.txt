 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting plural form for words ending in 'y' would be incorrect. The original code fragment `w.substr(<PLACEHOLDER>, w.length - 2)` correctly removes the last two characters of the word, while `w.substr(w.length - 1, w.length - 2)` would result in an empty string being appended to the word, instead of 'ies'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting plural form for words with a length of 2 or less would be incorrect. The original code fragment `w.substr(<PLACEHOLDER>, w.length - 2)` correctly handles words of any length, while `w.substr(-2, w.length - 2)` would result in a negative index error for words with a length of 2 or less.
