 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional block would no longer execute, and unhandled rejections would not be tracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional check would fail, and unhandled rejections would not be tracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional check would treat `process` as falsy, and unhandled rejections would not be tracked.

DONE.
