  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch(
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is not defined on the `Promise.prototype` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.send(
```
This would result in different behavior because the `send` method is not defined on the `Promise.prototype` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.post(
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is not defined on the `Promise.prototype` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
