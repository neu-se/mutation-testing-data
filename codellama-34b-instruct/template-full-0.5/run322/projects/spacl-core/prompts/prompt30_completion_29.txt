  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg - acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses addition, while this replacement uses subtraction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => acc + seg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not add 1 to the accumulator, while this replacement does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg * acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses addition, while this replacement uses multiplication.

DONE.
