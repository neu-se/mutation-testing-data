  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last part of the URL path, which could cause the `gettype` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/index.html");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new part to the URL path, which could cause the `gettype` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/default.html");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new part to the URL path, which could cause the `gettype` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
