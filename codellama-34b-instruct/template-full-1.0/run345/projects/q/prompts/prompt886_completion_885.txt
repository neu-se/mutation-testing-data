  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1).shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only the first element of the arguments array, rather than the entire slice of the array from the first argument onward.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all elements of the arguments array from the first argument onward, but would omit the last element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all elements of the arguments array from the first argument onward, but in reverse order.

DONE.
