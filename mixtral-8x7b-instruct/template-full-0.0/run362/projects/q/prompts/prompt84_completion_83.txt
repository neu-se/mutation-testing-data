 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(flush, 100);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with a delay of 100ms instead of being called asynchronously using `requestTick`. This change could expose tests that rely on the immediate execution of the `flush` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick.runAfter` function would no longer execute the provided task. This change could expose tests that rely on the correct execution of the `nextTick.runAfter` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick.runAfter` function would no longer execute the provided task. This change could expose tests that rely on the correct execution of the `nextTick.runAfter` function.

DONE.
