  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `pull` with 3 arguments, while this replacement calls it with 4 arguments. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently, especially if it relies on the number of arguments passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `pull` with 3 arguments, while this replacement calls it with 5 arguments. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently, especially if it relies on the number of arguments passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4], ref[5])
```
