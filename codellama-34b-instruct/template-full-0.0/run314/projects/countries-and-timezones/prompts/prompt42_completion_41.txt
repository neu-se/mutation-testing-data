  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a timezone object instead of a country object, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, { deprecated: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a country object that includes deprecated timezones, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, { allTimezones: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a country object that includes all timezones, including deprecated ones, which is not what the function is intended to do.

DONE.
