  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCharCode(0)` returns the string "\0", which is not the same as the original code fragment `String.fromCharCode`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCharCode(1)` returns the string "\1", which is not the same as the original code fragment `String.fromCharCode`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCharCode(2)` returns the string "\2", which is not the same as the original code fragment `String.fromCharCode`.

DONE.
