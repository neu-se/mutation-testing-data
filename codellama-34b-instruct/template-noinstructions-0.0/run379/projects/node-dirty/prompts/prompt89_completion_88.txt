  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `!rowStr` would evaluate to `true` if `rowStr` is an empty string, while `rowStr.length === 0` would only evaluate to `true` if `rowStr` is an empty string or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `!rowStr` would evaluate to `true` if `rowStr` is an empty string, while `rowStr === ''` would only evaluate to `true` if `rowStr` is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `!rowStr` would evaluate to `true` if `rowStr` is an empty string, while `rowStr.trim() === ''` would only evaluate to `true` if `rowStr` is an empty string
