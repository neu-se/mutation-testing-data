  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned an empty string, while the new code fragment returns a string with a single space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned an empty string, while the new code fragment returns a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned an empty string, while the new code fragment returns an undefined value.

DONE.
