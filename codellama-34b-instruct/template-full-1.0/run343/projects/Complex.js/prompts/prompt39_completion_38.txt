  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the square of the sum of the two arguments, rather than the logarithm of their hypotenuse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the product of the two arguments, rather than the logarithm of their hypotenuse.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a / b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the ratio of the two arguments, rather than the logarithm of their hypotenuse.

DONE.
