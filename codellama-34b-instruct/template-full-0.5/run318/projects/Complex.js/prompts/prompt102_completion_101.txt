  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the minus sign to indicate a negative number, while the new code fragment uses the plus sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '*' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the minus sign to indicate a negative number, while the new code fragment uses multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '/' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the minus sign to indicate a negative number, while the new code fragment uses division.

DONE.
