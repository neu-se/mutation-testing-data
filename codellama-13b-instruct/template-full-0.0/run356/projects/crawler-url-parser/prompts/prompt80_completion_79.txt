  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method returns the value of the `href` attribute, while the original code fragment returns the value of the `href` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` method returns the value of the `href` property, while the original code fragment returns the value of the `href` attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is used to remove the query string from the `href` attribute, while the original code fragment does not modify the `href` attribute.

DONE.
