  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || point.type !== 'Feature'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `point.type !== 'Feature'` would cause the function to throw an error if the `point` object has a `type` property with a value of `'Feature'`, even if it also has a `coordinates` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.type !== 'Feature'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `point.type !== 'Feature'` would cause the function to throw an error if the `point` object has a `type` property with a value of `'Feature'`, even if it also has a `coordinates` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || point.type !== 'Feature' || point.type !== 'Polygon'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional conditions `point
