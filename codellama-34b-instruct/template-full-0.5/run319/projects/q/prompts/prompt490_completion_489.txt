  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `rejected`, so if `rejected` is truthy, `!rejected` would be falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits if the first operand is falsy, so if `rejected` is falsy, the expression `rejected && false` would always be falsy, regardless of the value of `rejected`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits if the first operand is truthy, so if `rejected` is truthy, the expression `rejected || false` would always be truthy, regardless of the
