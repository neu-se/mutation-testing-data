  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator will concatenate the `content` string with the string `'foo'`, resulting in a different output than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method will convert the `content` string to uppercase, resulting in a different output than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method will return a substring of the `content` string starting from the second character, resulting in a different output than the original code fragment.

DONE.
