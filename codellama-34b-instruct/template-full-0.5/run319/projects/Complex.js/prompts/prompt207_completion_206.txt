  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0 && z['re'] > 0 && z['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `z['re']` and `z['im']` are greater than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment only checks if `z['im']` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0 && z['re'] > 0 && z['im'] <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `z['re']` and `z['im']` are greater than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment only checks if `z['im']` is less than or equal to 0.
