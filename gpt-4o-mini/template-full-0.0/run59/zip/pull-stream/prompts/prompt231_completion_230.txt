Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!loop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate immediately if `loop` is false, preventing any iterations from occurring, which could lead to missing data that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the loop to continue if `end` is strictly equal to `null`, which is likely not the intended condition and could lead to premature termination of the reading process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an infinite loop, continuously calling `read` without ever breaking out, which could lead to a stack overflow or unresponsive behavior.

DONE.
