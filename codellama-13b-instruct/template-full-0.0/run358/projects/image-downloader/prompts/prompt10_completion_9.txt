  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would be called on the `options.dest` string, which would cause the file name to be saved in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would be called on the `options.dest` string, which would cause the file name to be saved in lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/ /g, '_')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would be called on the `options.dest` string, which would replace all spaces with underscores.

DONE.
