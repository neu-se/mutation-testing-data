  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `false` if `abort` is not truthy, even if the function is supposed to return `true` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would always return `true` if `abort` is truthy, even if the function is supposed to return `true` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `true` if `abort` is truthy, even if the function is supposed to return `false` in that case.

DONE.
