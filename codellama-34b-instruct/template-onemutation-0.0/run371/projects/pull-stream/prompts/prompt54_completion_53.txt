  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.source` is a function that returns a new source, whereas `s.sink` is a function that returns a new sink. Using `s.source` instead of `s.sink` would cause the code to create a new source instead of a new sink, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
