  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is now always `false`, which means that the `requestTick` function will never be called, even if there are tasks in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is now always `null`, which means that the `requestTick` function will never be called, even if there are tasks in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is now always `undefined`, which means that the `requestTick` function will never be called, even if there are tasks in the queue.

DONE.
