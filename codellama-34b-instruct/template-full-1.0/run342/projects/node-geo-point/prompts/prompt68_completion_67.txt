  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the division operation would no longer be performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinθ + cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the rad2deg function would not be applied to the result of the division operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operation would no longer be performed.

DONE.
