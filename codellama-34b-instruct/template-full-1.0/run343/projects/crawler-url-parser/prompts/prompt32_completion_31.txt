  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the 'http' protocol with 'https' would cause the code to attempt to connect to a different domain, potentially resulting in a connection error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the 'http' protocol with 'file' would cause the code to attempt to access a local file system, potentially resulting in a file system error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the 'http' protocol with an empty string would cause the code to attempt to connect to a default domain, potentially resulting in a connection error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
