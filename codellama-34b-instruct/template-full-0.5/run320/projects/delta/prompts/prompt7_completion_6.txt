  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attributes[key]` would return the value of the `key` property of the `attributes` object, whereas `attributes` on its own would return the `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[key]` would return the value of the `key` property of the `b` object, whereas `attributes` on its own would return the `attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a[key]` would return the value of the `key` property of the `a` object, whereas `attributes` on its own would return the `attributes` object.

DONE.
