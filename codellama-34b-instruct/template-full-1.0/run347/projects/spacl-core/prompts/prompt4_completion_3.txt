  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the spec string has a forward slash anywhere, rather than just at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the spec string has two consecutive forward slashes anywhere, rather than just at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the spec string has a forward slash anywhere, rather than just at the beginning, and negate the result.

DONE.
