 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
10, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return an empty string instead of the string "[object Object]".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would throw a TypeError, as it expects a number as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
8, 'length'
