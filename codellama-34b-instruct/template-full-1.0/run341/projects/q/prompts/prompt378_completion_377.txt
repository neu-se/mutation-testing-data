  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).tap(function (value) {
  return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the tap function would not be called in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).tap(function (value) {
  throw new Error("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the tap function would throw an error in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).tap(function (value) {
  return Q(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the tap function would return a promise in the original code.

DONE.
