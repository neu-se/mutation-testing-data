  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a different function than `isNaN`, and it returns `true` if the number is not NaN or infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isNaN` is the negation of `isNaN`, and it returns `true` if the number is not NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is NaN, whereas the original code fragment checks if the real part is NaN.

DONE.
