  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a new rejected promise with the given reason, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and does not have a `reject` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` creates a new fulfilled promise with the given reason, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and does not have a `resolve` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` creates a new deferred object, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and does not have a `defer` method.

DONE.
