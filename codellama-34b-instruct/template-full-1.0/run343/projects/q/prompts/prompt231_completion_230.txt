  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` changes the array in place, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array. This change could cause unintended consequences if the code is expecting the array to be a certain length or if the code is relying on the particular index of the progress listeners in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` iterates over the array and performs the given function on each element, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array. This change could cause unintended consequences if the code is expecting a different number of progress listeners or if the code is relying on the particular index of the progress listeners in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element
