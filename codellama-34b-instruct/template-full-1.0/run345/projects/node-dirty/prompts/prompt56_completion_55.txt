  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `close` method to be called with a parameter, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `close` method with a boolean value, which could affect the behavior of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.closeAfter(5000)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `closeAfter` method with a delay parameter, which could cause the database to be closed after a longer period of time, potentially resulting in data loss or corruption.

DONE.
