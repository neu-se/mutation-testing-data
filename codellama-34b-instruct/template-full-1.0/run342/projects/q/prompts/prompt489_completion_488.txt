  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return unhandledReasons.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `unhandledReasons.length = 0`, which clears the array, whereas this code fragment uses `pop()`, which removes and returns the last element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return unhandledReasons.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `unhandledReasons.length = 0`, which clears the array, whereas this code fragment uses `shift()`, which removes and returns the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return unhandledReasons.slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `unhandledReasons.length = 0`, which clears the array, whereas this code fragment uses `slice()`, which returns a new array with a subset of the original array's elements.

DONE
