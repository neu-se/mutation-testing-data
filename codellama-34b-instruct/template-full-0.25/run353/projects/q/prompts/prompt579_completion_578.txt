  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.apply` is a different function than `continuer.bind`, and it would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.call` is a different function than `continuer.bind`, and it would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error, which would be caught by the `errback` function and handled differently than the original code.

DONE.
