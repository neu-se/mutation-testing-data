  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isGlob` always returns a boolean value, and `!isGlob(src)` would always return the opposite value. In the original code, `!isGlob(src)` is used to check if `src` is a glob pattern, but if it's replaced with `isGlob(src)`, it would always return `true` (unless `src` is an empty string).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isGlob(undefined)` would throw a `TypeError` because `isGlob` is not defined. In the original code, `!isGlob(src)` is used to check if `src` is a glob pattern, but if it's replaced with `!isGlob(undefined)`, it would throw a `TypeError` because `isGlob` is not defined.
