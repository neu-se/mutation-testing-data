  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that returns a stream, whereas `nextChunk` is a function that returns a chunk of data from the current stream. Using `nextStream` instead of `nextChunk` would cause the code to enter an infinite loop, as it would keep calling `nextStream` without ever returning any data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a callback function that is called with the data from the current stream. Using `cb(null, data)` instead of `nextChunk` would cause the code to return the data from the current stream immediately, without processing any of the other streams.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function(end, stream) {
  if(end)
    return cb(end)
  if(stream && 'object' === typeof stream)
