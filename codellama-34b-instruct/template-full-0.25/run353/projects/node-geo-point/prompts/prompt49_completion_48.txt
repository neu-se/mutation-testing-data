  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values are swapped, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is used twice, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is increased by 1, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
