  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function returns the cosine of a number, whereas the original code fragment `cos` is a reference to the `cos` function, which is not defined in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function returns the sine of a number, whereas the original code fragment `cos` is a reference to the `cos` function, which is not defined in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.tan` function returns the tangent of a number, whereas the original code fragment `cos` is a reference to the `cos` function, which is not defined in the code.

DONE.
