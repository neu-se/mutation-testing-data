  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `.prop` is a property accessor that returns the property value of the `href` attribute, whereas `.attr` is an attribute accessor that returns the value of the `href` attribute as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this)val
```
This would result in different behavior because `.val` is a method that returns the value of the `href` attribute, whereas `.attr` is an attribute accessor that returns the value of the `href` attribute as a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).hasClass("target")
```
This would result in different behavior because `.hasClass("target")` returns a boolean indicating whether the `href` attribute has the value `"target"`, whereas `.attr` returns the value of the `href` attribute as a string.

DONE.
