Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to throw an error when `shouldThrow` is false, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw an error regardless of the `shouldThrow` option, thus ignoring the user's intention to suppress the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` instead of throwing an error, which would change how the function handles errors when parsing JSON.

DONE.
