  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs.filter(t => t.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `allTimezones` property of the `country` object, which contains all timezones for the country, regardless of whether they are deprecated or not. The new code uses the `timezones` property of the `country` object, which only contains the non-deprecated timezones for the country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs.filter(t => !t.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `allTimezones` property of the `country` object, which contains all timezones for the country, regardless of whether they are deprecated or not. The new code uses the `timezones` property of the `country` object, which only contains the non-deprecated timezones for the country.
