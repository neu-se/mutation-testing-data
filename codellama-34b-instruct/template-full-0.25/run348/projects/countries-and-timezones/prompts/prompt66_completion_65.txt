  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is not defined in the `options` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timezones` property is not defined in the `options` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.countries
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countries` property is not defined in the `options` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
