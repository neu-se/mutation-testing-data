  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be different from the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be different from the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be a string representation of the original value, rather than the original value itself.

DONE.
