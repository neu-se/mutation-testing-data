  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This will replace the `Number` function with a random number, which will cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100)
```
This will replace the `Number` function with a random number between 0 and 100, which will cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(Math.random() * 100)
```
This will replace the `Number` function with a random number between 0 and 100, which will cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than expected.

DONE.
