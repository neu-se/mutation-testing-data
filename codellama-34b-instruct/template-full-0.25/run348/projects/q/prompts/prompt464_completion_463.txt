  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the value returned by the `then` method, which is not the same as the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is rejected with the value returned by the `catch` method, which is not the same as the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the value returned by the `finally` method, which is not the same as the original promise.

DONE.
