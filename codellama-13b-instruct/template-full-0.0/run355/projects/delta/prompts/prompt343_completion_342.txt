  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` function would return `null`, which would cause the `transform` function to throw an error when trying to access the `handler` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler('invalid')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` function would return `undefined`, which would cause the `transform` function to throw an error when trying to access the `handler` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler('embed')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` function would return the `embed` handler object, which would cause the `transform` function to use the `embed` handler's `transform` method to transform the embed data, rather than the `retain` method. This could result in different behavior depending on the specific implementation of the `embed` handler's `transform` method
