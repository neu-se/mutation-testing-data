  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, but this new code fragment only checks if `op.retain` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, but this new code fragment only checks if `op.retain` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, but this new code fragment checks if `op.retain` is not an object.

DONE.
