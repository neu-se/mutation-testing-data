  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mouses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the "s" to the end of the word "mouse" to make it plural, but this new code fragment adds "es" to the end of the word "mouse" instead, which would result in the incorrect plural form "mouses".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the "s" to the end of the word "mouse" to make it plural, but this new code fragment adds "ices" to the end of the word "mouse" instead, which would result in the incorrect plural form "mices".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mous')
```
This would result in different behavior because
