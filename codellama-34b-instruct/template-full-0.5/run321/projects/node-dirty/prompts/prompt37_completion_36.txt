  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue` is a Map object, while `this._data` is a Map object that contains the actual data being stored in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the `Dirty` object instance, while `this._data` refers to the `Map` object that contains the data being stored in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.keys()` returns an iterator over the keys in the `Map` object, while `this._data` returns the `Map` object itself.

DONE.
