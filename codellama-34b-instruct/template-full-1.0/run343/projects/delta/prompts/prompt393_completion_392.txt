  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` advances the iterator to the next operation, while `otherIter.peek()` only returns the next operation without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.insert()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.insert()` inserts a new operation into the iterator, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.delete()` deletes the current operation from the iterator, which may not be intended.

DONE.
