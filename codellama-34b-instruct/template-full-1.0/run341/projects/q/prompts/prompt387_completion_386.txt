  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the fulfilled callback is called with the value of the promise as its parameter, while in the mutated code, the fulfilled callback would be called with `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the fulfilled callback is called with the value of the promise as its parameter, while in the mutated code, the fulfilled callback would be called with `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the fulfilled callback is called with the value of the promise as its parameter, while in the mutated code, the fulfilled callback would be called with a new placeholder value instead.

DONE.
