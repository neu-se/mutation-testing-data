  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(err && abort) || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call `cb` if `err` and `abort` are both truthy, whereas the original code would call `cb` if either `err` or `abort` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(err || abort) && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call `cb` if `err` and `abort` are both falsy, whereas the original code would call `cb` if either `err` or `abort` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(err === abort) && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call `cb` if `err` is equal to `abort`, whereas the original code would call `cb` if either `err` or `abort` is truthy.

DONE.
