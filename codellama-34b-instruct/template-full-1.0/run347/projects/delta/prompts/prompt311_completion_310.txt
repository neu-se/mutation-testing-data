  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would not be able to iterate over the lines of the document correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
j
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would not be able to iterate over the lines of the document correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
k
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would not be able to iterate over the lines of the document correctly.

DONE.
