  Sure, I can provide some suggestions for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with buggy code fragments that have different behavior than the original code fragment. Here are three options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, as the condition would evaluate to `true` when `index` is equal to zero, whereas the original code fragment would not iterate when `index` is equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not iterate at all, as the condition would evaluate to `false` when `index` is zero, whereas the original code fragment would iterate when `index` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1 <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, as the condition would evaluate to `true` when `index` is equal to one, whereas the
