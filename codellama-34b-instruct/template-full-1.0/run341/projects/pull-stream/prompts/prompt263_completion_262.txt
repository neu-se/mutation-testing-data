  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is called with only the first element of `data` instead of the entire array, which could cause the test to pass even if the function is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Something went wrong'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is called with a different error message than the one originally passed to the function, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) return nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior
