  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack.slice(0)
```
This code fragment will create a shallow copy of the `stack` property of the `reason` object, which may have different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack.concat()
```
This code fragment will create a new array that is a concatenation of the `stack` property of the `reason` object, which may have different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack.reverse()
```
This code fragment will create a new array that is the reverse of the `stack` property of the `reason` object, which may have different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
