  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, while `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is the cosine function from the `Math` object, while `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function from the `Math` object, while `cos` is the cosine function.

DONE.
