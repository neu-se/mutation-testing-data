  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[2]`, which is not the same as `ref[1]` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1], ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the `pull` function would be reversed, which could potentially cause issues if the function is not designed to handle that scenario.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument would be passed to the `pull` function, which could potentially cause issues if the function is not designed to handle that scenario.

DONE.
