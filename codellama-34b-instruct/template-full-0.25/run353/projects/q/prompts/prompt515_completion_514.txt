  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have rejected the promise with the exception, while this new code fragment would have resolved the promise with the exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.notify(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have rejected the promise with the exception, while this new code fragment would have notified the promise with the exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have rejected the promise with the exception, while this new code fragment would have resolved the promise with the exception.

DONE.
