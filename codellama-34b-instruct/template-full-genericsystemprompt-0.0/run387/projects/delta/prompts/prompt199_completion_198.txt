  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest` returns the remaining ops in the iterator, while `thisIter.rest.slice(1)` returns the remaining ops except for the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.rest` returns the remaining ops in the iterator, while `otherIter.rest.slice(1)` returns the remaining ops except for the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.concat(otherIter.rest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest.concat(otherIter.rest)` returns the concatenation of the remaining ops in both iterators, while `thisIter.rest` and `otherIter.rest` return the remaining ops in each iterator separately.

DONE.
