  Option 1:
```regex.test('fe')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for the presence of "ves" in the word, but this mutation would instead check for the presence of "fe" in the word.

Option 2:
```%w.replace(%r{ toggle }, 'holes')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for the presence of "es" in the word, but this mutation would instead check for the presence of "holes" in the word.

Option 3:
```w.gsub('f', 'p')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for the presence of "f" in the word, but this mutation would instead check for the presence of "p" in the word.

DONE.
