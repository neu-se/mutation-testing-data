  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "undefined" && ReturnValue === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `ReturnValue === "undefined"` would always evaluate to `false`, making the entire expression `false`. This would cause the `else` block to be executed, which would result in the `QReturnValue` function being defined differently than in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "undefined" || ReturnValue === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `ReturnValue === "undefined"` would always evaluate to `true`, making the entire expression `true`. This would cause the `if` block to be executed, which would result in the `QReturnValue` function being defined differently than in the original code.
