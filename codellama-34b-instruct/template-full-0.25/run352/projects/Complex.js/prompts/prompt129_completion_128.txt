  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite()` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property is not defined on the `Complex` object, so it would return `undefined` when accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite()` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

DONE.
