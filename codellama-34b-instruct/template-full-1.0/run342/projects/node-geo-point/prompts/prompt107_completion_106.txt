  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of 1 is different from 2, which would change the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of 3 would change the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ object }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the zoom variable.

DONE.
