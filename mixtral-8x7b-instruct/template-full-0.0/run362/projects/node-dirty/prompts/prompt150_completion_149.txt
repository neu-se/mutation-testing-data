 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the callback function is not being checked, so it might cause unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the error-first callback pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(new Error('Artificial error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because an artificial error is being created and passed to the callback, which might cause the error handling code to execute and change the flow of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setImmediate(() => cb())
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is being scheduled to run asynchronously using `setImmediate`, which might cause race conditions or unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the synchronous execution of the callback.

DONE.
