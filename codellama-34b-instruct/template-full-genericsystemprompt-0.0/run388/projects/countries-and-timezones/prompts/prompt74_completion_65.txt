  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `name` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `toUpperCase()` method to convert the name to uppercase. This could cause issues if the code relies on the original case of the name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `name` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `length` property to get the length of the name. This could cause issues if the code relies on the original length of the name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split(' ')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `name` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `split()` method to split the name into an array of substrings, and then takes the first element of the array. This could cause issues if the code re
