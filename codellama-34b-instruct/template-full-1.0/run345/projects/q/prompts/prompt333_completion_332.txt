  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolver` is a function pointer to the function that resolves the promise, whereas `result` is the result of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function pointer, so the `promiseDispatch` function would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function pointer, so the `promiseDispatch` function would throw an error.

DONE.
