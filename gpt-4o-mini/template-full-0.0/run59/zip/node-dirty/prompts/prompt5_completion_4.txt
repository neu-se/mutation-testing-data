Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete the entry with the literal string 'key' instead of the variable `key`, leading to incorrect deletion behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete the entry with the key `null`, which is not the intended behavior and would not remove the intended entry from the `_data` map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys().next().value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the first key in the `_data` map instead of the specified `key`, potentially removing an unrelated entry and not the one intended by the user.

DONE.
