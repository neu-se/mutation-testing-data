  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value is present in the string, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(0, e.stack.indexOf("\n"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first line of the stack trace, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the entire string.

DONE.
