  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push(...)
```
This would result in different behavior because push() would add the new delta operation to the end of the delta object, whereas delete() would remove the specified number of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because retain() would keep the specified number of characters, while delete() would remove them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(-length)
```
This would result in different behavior because retain() with a negative length would remove the specified number of characters, while delete() would remove them.

DONE.
