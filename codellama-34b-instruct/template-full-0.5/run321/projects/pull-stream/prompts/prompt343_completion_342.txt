  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a boolean value, and adding 1 to it would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!abort` is the opposite of `abort`, so the resulting behavior would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `||` is a logical OR operator, and `true` is always truthy, so the resulting behavior would be different.

DONE.
