 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, causing an infinite loop when deleting operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the previous operation, which may not have the correct length for the deletion, causing unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.current()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the current operation, which does not change the iterator, and may cause an infinite loop or incorrect deletion.

DONE.
