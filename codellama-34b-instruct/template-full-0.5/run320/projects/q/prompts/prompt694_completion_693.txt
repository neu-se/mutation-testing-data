  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.fbind` function to always return a rejected promise, rather than the expected resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.fbind` function to always return a resolved promise with the value `1`, rather than the expected resolved promise with the value returned by the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(function () { return 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.fbind` function to always return a resolved promise with the value `1`, rather than the expected resolved promise with the value returned by the original function.

DONE.
