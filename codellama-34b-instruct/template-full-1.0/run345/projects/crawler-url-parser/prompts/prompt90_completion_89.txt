  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(href.length > 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment also checked for the existence of the `href` attribute, but this new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(typeof href !== "undefined" && href.length > 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment also tested for the length of the `href` attribute, but this new code fragment only tests for the type of the `href` attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(href.length > 3 && /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the original code fragment only matches the beginning of the `href` attribute, but this new code fragment matches any occurrence of the pattern in the `href` attribute.

DONE.
