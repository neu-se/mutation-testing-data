  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` instead of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` and `b` separately, while this code fragment combines them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` and `b` separately, while this code fragment subtracts them.

DONE.
