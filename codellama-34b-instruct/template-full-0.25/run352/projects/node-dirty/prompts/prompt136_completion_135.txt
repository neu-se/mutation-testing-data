  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) + 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value associated with the key would be incremented by 1, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) - 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value associated with the key would be decremented by 1, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) * 2}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value associated with the key would be doubled, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

DONE.
