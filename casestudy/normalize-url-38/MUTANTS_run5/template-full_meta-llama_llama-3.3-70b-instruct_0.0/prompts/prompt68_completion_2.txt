Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlObj.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the pathname matches the regex instead of the hostname, potentially leading to incorrect removal of 'www.' from the hostname.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlObj.hostname.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the lowercase version of the hostname, which could lead to incorrect results if the hostname contains uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlObj.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the protocol (e.g., 'http:' or 'https:') instead of the hostname, which would always result in incorrect removal of 'www.'.

DONE.
