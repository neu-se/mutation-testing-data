 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
target.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last element from the `passed` or `failed` array instead of pushing the current `op` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
target.length++
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the `length` property of the `passed` or `failed` array, which is not used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
<target as any>.push(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `push` method on the `target` variable, which might not be an array, causing the code to fail when the `target` is not an array or does not have a `push` method.

DONE.
