  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.abs` have different ranges and output values. `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number, which can be negative, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, which is always positive.

DONE.
