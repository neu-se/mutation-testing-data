  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `!cb` is a logical NOT operation that returns `true` if `cb` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `cb+1` adds 1 to the return value of `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb*10
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `cb*10` multiplies the return value of `cb` by 10.

DONE.
