  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key1, key2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using a single key, whereas the replaced code fragment is using a list of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using a single key, whereas the replaced code fragment is using a key and a modified version of that key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using a single key, whereas the replaced code fragment is using a modified version of the key.

DONE.
