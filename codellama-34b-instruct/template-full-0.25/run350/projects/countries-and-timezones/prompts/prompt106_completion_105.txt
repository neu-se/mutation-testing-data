  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country === null` would check if the `country` variable is null, while `!country` would check if the `country` variable is falsy (i.e., null, undefined, 0, NaN, or an empty string).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.length === 0` would check if the `country` variable is an empty string, while `!country` would check if the `country` variable is falsy (i.e., null, undefined, 0, NaN, or an empty string).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.length === 1` would check if the `country` variable is a string with a length of 1, while `!country` would check if the `country
