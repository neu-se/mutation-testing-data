 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return -1 (the index of the first occurrence of the specified text in the string) instead of a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(text) && text.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for the inclusion of the `text` variable if it is an array, and not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.prototype.includes
