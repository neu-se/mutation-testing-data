  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `newOp` to be an object, but `null` is a primitive value that does not have properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `newOp` to be an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `newOp.insert` to be a string or an object, but `null` is a primitive value that does not have properties or methods.

DONE.
