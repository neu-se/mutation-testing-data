  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original boolean value, causing the function to behave differently when `hasNext` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the `hasNext` property to false, which could affect the logic of the function in unexpected ways.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of operations in the `ops` array, not the index of the current operation.

DONE.
