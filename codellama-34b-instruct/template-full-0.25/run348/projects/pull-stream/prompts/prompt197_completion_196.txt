  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `busy` variable is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if the `map` function is not currently running.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy && !aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!busy` check would be redundant with the `if` statement, and the `!aborted` check would cause the `read` function to be called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!aborted` check would cause the `read` function to be called with a different argument than the original code, and the `busy` variable would not be checked at all.

DONE.
