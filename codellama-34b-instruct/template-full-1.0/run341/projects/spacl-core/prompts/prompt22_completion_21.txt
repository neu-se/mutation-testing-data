  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes one argument to the `Symbol.match` method, whereas the new fragment passes two arguments. This would cause the method to return a different value, which could potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string, 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a variable as the first argument to the `Symbol.match` method, whereas the new fragment passes a string literal. This could cause the method to return a different value, which could potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a variable as the first argument to the `Symbol.match` method, whereas the new fragment passes `null`. This could cause the method to return
