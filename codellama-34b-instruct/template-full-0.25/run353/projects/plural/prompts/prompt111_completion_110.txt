  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a regular expression that matches a vertical bar, while the new code fragment is a string that contains a vertical bar.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'||'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a regular expression that matches a vertical bar, while the new code fragment is a string that contains two vertical bars.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a regular expression that matches a vertical bar, while the new code fragment is a string that contains a vertical bar.

DONE.
