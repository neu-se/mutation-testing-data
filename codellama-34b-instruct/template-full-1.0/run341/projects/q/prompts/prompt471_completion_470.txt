  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled", Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the event emitted by `process.emit()` from `"unhandledRejection"` to `"fulfilled"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], unhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the parameters passed to `process.emit()` to refer to the wrong values from the `unhandledReasons` and `unhandledRejections` arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], unhandledRejections[at + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the parameter passed to `process.emit()` to refer to the wrong value from the `unhandledReasons` array.

DONE.
