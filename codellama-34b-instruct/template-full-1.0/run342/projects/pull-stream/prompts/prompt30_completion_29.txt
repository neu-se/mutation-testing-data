  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function always return the first argument, regardless of the number of arguments passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function always return the length of the arguments array, instead of a specific argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function always return the next argument after `ref[0]`, instead of the `i`-th argument.
