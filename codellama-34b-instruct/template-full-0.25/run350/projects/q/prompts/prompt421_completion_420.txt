  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise` would return `true` if `isPromise` is `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to be executed even if `isPromise` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise === false` would only return `true` if `isPromise` is `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to be executed only if `isPromise` is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise !== true` would return `true` if `isPromise` is not a promise, which would cause the `if` statement to be executed if `isPromise` is not a promise.

DONE.
