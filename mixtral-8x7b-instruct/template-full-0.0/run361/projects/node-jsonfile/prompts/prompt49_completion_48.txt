 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the return value of `fs.writeFileSync()` would be a boolean `true` instead of any value returned by the original `options` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `null` instead of the value that `fs.writeFileSync()` would return with the original `options` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a random number instead of the value that `fs.writeFileSync()` would return with the original `options` parameter.

DONE.
