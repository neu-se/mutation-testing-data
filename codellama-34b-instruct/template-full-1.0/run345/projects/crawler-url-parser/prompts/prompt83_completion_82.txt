  A job would be an expert in mutation analysis.  The goal is to make minor variations in the program code in order to find flaws in the testing suite.

If none of the tests fail after a modification, that indicates that the tests may not be as thorough as the developers may have hoped. This should encourage programmers to modify these tests.

In the referenced code, the code-snippet below incorporates one possible variation in place of the "PLACEHOLDER" variable. Here, we include a variance for the "PLACEHOLDER" variable.  

```scala
$(this)
const URL = require('url');
const psl = require('psl');
const cheerio = require('cheerio');

const result_normalize_options = {
    removeDirectoryIndex: true,
    removeTrailingSlash: true,
    stripWWW: true,
    stripFragment: true,
    normalizeHttps: false,
    normalizeProtocol: true,
    removeQueryParameters: [/^utm_\w+/i, 'ref']
}
