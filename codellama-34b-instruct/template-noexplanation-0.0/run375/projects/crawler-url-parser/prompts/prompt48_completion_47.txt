  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a different value for the `search` property of the parsed URL, which may affect the behavior of the `extract` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a different value for the `hash` property of the parsed URL, which may affect the behavior of the `extract` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a different value for the `search` and `hash` properties of the parsed URL, which may affect the behavior of the `extract` function.

DONE.
