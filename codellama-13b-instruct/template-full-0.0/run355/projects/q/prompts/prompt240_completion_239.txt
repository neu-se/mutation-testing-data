  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(nearerValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is thenable, while `isPromise` checks if the value is a promise. The two functions have different behavior when the value is a thenable that is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(nearerValue) || isPromiseAlike(nearerValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value is a promise or thenable. This would allow the code to handle thenables that are not promises, which is not the case with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(nearerValue) && isPromiseAlike(nearerValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value is both a promise and thenable. This would allow the code to handle promises that are also thenables, which is
