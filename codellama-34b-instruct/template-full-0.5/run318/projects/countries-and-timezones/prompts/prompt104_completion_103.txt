  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of each timezone, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different set of timezones than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of each timezone, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different set of timezones than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of each timezone, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different set of timezones than the original code.

DONE.
