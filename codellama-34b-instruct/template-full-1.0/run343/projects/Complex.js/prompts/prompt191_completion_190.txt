  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.sin```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.pow()`, which raises the number to the given power, while `Math.sin()` returns the sine of the given number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.cos```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.pow()`, which raises the number to the given power, while `Math.cos()` returns the cosine of the given number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.tan```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.pow()`, which raises the number to the given power, while `Math.tan()` returns the tangent of the given number.

DONE.
