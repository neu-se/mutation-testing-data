 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / (a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the divisor from the original `a, b` to `1 / (a * b)`, which can lead to different results in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.hypot(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the arguments of the `Math.hypot()` function, which can lead to different results in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log(a) + Math.log(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the logarithm from the original `Math.log(a * b)` to `Math.log(a) + Math.log(b)`, which can lead to different results in the calculation.

DONE.
