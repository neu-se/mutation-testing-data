  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but `null` is not a valid GeoPoint object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object with latitude and longitude values, but `new GeoPoint(0, 0)` creates a new GeoPoint object with latitude and longitude values of 0, which is not the same as the original GeoPoint object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but `this.latitude` is a number representing the latitude of the current GeoPoint object, which is not the same as a GeoPoint object.

DONE.
