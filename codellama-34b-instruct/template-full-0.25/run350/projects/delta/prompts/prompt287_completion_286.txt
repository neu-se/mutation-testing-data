  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is checking if the index is before the beginning of the string. Replacing it with `index > 0` would check if the index is after the end of the string, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is checking if the index is before the beginning of the string. Replacing it with `index >= 0` would check if the index is at or after the beginning of the string, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is checking if the index is before the
