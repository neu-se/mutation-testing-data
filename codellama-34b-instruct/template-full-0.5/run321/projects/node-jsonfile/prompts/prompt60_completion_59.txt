  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) && content.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only strip the BOM if the content is a buffer and has a length greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.startsWith('\uFEFF')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only strip the BOM if the content starts with the BOM character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.includes('\uFEFF')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would strip the BOM if the content includes the BOM character anywhere, not just at the beginning.

DONE.
