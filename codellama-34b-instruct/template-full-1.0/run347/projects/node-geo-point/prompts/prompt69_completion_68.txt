  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because x is not the correct value for the `tan` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because y is not the correct value for the `atan2` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is not a valid value for the `atan2` function.

DONE.
