  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'end' is an event that is emitted when the write stream is closed, while 'drain' is an event that is emitted when the write stream is drained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'finish' is an event that is emitted when the write stream is closed and all data has been written, while 'drain' is an event that is emitted when the write stream is drained, but not necessarily when all data has been written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'error' is an event that is emitted when there is an error in the write stream, while 'drain' is an event that is emitted when the write stream is drained, but not necessarily when there is an error.

DONE.
