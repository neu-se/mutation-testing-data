  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if there are no more ops to iterate over, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over any ops that are not deletions, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over any ops that have a length of 0, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.

DONE.
