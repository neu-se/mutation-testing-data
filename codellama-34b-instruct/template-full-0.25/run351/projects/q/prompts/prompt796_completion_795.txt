  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, void 0, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progress notification to be sent to the `progressed` function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, void 0, function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progress notification to be sent to an empty function, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, void 0, function (reason) { throw reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progress notification to be sent to a function that throws an error, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

DONE.
