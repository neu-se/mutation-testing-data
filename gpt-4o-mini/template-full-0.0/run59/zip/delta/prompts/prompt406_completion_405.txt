Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'wrongEmbedType'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the embed type to a string that does not match any valid embed type, causing the handler to be undefined and potentially leading to a runtime error or incorrect transformation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `otherData` instead of `thisData`, which may lead to incorrect transformations if the data structures of `thisData` and `otherData` are different, resulting in unexpected behavior in the transformation logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData[embedType] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the data being passed to the handler by adding 1, which could lead to incorrect transformation results, as the handler would receive an unexpected value that does not correspond to the original data.

DONE.
