  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first match, whereas `match` returns an array of matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` replaces the first match with the specified replacement string, whereas `match` returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` replaces all matches with the specified replacement string, whereas `match` returns an array of matches.

DONE.
