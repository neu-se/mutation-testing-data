  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isFinite` operator checks whether a value is not finite, while the `Number.isFinite` method checks whether a value is a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b % 2 === 0` expression checks whether `b` is divisible by 2, while the `Number.isFinite` method checks whether a value is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a < b` expression checks whether `a` is less than `b`, while the `Number.isFinite` method checks whether a value is a finite number.

DONE.
