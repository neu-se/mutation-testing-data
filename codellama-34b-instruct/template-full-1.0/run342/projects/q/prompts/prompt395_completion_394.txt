  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let removedLast = this.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` returns the removed element, while `then()` returns a new promise linked to the original one. Additionally, `pop()` mutates the original array, which could have unintended side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let removedLast = this.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` returns the removed element, while `then()` returns a new promise linked to the original one. Additionally, `shift()` mutates the original array, which could have unintended side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let removedLast = this.slice(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a new array with the specified elements, while `then()` returns a new promise linked to the original one. Additionally, `slice()` does not mutate the original array, so it is safer than the other options.
