  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(ops)` checks if `ops` is an array, while `ops.length > 0` checks if `ops` has a length greater than 0. If `ops` is not an array but has a length greater than 0, the condition would evaluate to `true` with the latter code fragment but `false` with the former.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ops === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(ops)` checks if `ops` is an array, while `typeof ops === 'object'` checks if `ops` is an object (but not necessarily an array). If `ops` is an object but not an array, the condition would evaluate to `true` with the latter code fragment but `false` with the former.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops && ops.length >
