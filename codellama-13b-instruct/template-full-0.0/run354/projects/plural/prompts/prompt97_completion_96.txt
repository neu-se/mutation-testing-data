  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to replace the letter "a" with "e" in the word "man", while the buggy code fragment uses the `replace` method to replace the letter "a" with "e" in the word "wo" as well. This would result in the plural form of "man" being "men" instead of "men", which is the correct plural form.
