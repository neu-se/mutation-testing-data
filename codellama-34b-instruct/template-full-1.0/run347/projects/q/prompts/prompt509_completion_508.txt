  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is always `undefined`, whereas `thisp` may have a different value depending on the context in which the arrow function is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a constant value, whereas `thisp` may have a different value depending on the context in which the arrow function is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant value, whereas `thisp` may have a different value depending on the context in which the arrow function is executed.

DONE.
