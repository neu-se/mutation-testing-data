  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(a)` returns an array of keys from the `a` object, while `attributes` is an object that contains the attributes of the `a` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(a)` returns an array of values from the `a` object, while `attributes` is an object that contains the attributes of the `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries(a)` returns an array of key-value pairs from the `a` object, while `attributes` is an object that contains the attributes of the `a` object.

DONE.
