  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the equality of `end` with `true`, while the new code fragment only checks if `end` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the equality of `end` with `true`, while the new code fragment checks for the inequality of `end` with `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? end : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` if `end` is falsy, while the new code fragment returns `end` if it is falsy.

DONE.
