  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { throw reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only throw an error if the promise was rejected, while this new code fragment would throw an error regardless of the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { return reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only return the rejection reason if the promise was rejected, while this new code fragment would return the rejection reason regardless of the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only return the fulfillment value if the promise was fulfilled, while this new code fragment would return the fulfillment value regardless of the promise's state.

DONE.
