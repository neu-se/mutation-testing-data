  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the data as is, while this modified code fragment logs the uppercase version of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the entire data, while this modified code fragment logs only the first character of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the data itself, while this modified code fragment logs the length of the data.

DONE.
