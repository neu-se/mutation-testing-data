Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index from 1 to 0, causing the first argument to be included instead of excluded, which may lead to unexpected results when calling the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the first two arguments instead of the first one, potentially omitting important data that should be passed to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it limits the slice to only one argument (the second one), which may not be sufficient for the callback that expects multiple arguments, leading to incorrect function execution.

DONE.
