  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of a value, whereas `callback.fcall` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with a given reason, whereas `callback.fcall` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with a given value, whereas `callback.fcall` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of a function.

DONE.
