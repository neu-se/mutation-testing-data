Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because using `call` instead of `apply` would pass the arguments as individual parameters rather than as an array, potentially leading to incorrect argument handling in the `promiseDispatch` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `bind` creates a new function with `this` set to `null`, which may not correctly reference the intended context for `promiseDispatch`, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the first argument to `apply` would set the `this` context of `promiseDispatch` to `null`, which could cause errors if the method relies on a specific context.

DONE.
