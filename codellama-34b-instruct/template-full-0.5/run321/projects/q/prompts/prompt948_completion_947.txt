  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("test"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an error, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the value `null`, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the value `42`, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
