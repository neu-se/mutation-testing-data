  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would be called on the result of `slice(1)`, which would reverse the order of the elements in the array, rather than reversing the order of the elements in the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.slice(1).reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would be called on the result of `slice(1)`, which would reverse the order of the elements in the array, rather than reversing the order of the elements in the original array. Additionally, the `<PLACEHOLDER>` would be replaced with a buggy code fragment, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.slice(1).reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would be called on the result of `
