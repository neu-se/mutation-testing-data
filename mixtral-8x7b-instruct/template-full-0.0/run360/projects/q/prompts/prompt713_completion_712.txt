 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is being replaced with the `values` method, which returns an array of an object's own enumerable string-keyed property values, rather than an array of the object's keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"keys", ["toString"]
```
This would result in different behavior because a hardcoded array containing the string "toString" is being passed as the second argument to the `dispatch` method, rather than an empty array. This would cause the `keys` method to only return the string "toString" as the key of the eventually settled object, instead of all of its keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"nonexistentMethod", []
