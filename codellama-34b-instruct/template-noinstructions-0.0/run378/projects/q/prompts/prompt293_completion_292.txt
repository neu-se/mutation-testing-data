  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, deferred.reject, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is replaced with `reject`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify, deferred.notify, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` and `reject` methods are replaced with `notify`, which would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is replaced with `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of notified.

DONE.
