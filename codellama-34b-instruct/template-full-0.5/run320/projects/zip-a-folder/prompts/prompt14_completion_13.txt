  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.W_OK` checks for write permissions, while `fs.constants.R_OK` checks for read permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.X_OK` checks for execute permissions, while `fs.constants.R_OK` checks for read permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.F_OK` checks for the existence of the file, while `fs.constants.R_OK` checks for read permissions.

DONE.
