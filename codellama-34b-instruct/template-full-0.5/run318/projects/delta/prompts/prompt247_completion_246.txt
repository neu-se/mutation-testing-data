  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be incremented by 1, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be decremented by 1, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be doubled, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

DONE.
