  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q + 1` is not a valid object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.foo` is not a valid property of the `Q` object, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, and would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
