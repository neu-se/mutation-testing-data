 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(end, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function again instead of continuing to the next iteration of the loop, causing potential infinite recursion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the `cb` function, which might not be handled correctly by the callback, causing unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a new anonymous function that does nothing, instead of calling the `next` function recursively. This would break the loop and cause the function to return prematurely, potentially skipping some input data.

DONE.
