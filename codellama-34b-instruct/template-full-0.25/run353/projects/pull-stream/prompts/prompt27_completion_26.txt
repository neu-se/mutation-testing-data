  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment reads the value of `read`, while this replacement reads the value of `read` and then adds 1 to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment reads the value of `read`, while this replacement reads the value of `read` and then subtracts 1 from it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment reads the value of `read`, while this replacement reads the value of `read` and then multiplies it by 2.

DONE.
