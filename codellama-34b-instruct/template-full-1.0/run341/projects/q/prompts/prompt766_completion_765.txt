  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Exception("Something went wrong"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code would throw an exception, causing the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code would have called `noop` and the promise would have been fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { return "Something went wrong"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code would return a string, causing the promise to be fulfilled with that string, whereas the original code would have called `noop` and the promise would have been fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code would return undefined, causing the promise to be fulfilled with undefined, whereas the original code would have called `noop` and the promise would have been fulfilled.

DONE.
