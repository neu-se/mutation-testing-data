  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because `keepNull` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even if `keepNull` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because `!keepNull` is always falsy, so the `if` statement would never be executed, even if `keepNull` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull()
```
This would result in different behavior because `keepNull()` is a function call, and the `if` statement would only be executed if the function returns a truthy value.

DONE.
