 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number between 0 and 360 instead of using the actual bearing value. This could lead to incorrect destination points or bearings when using the `calculateDestination` and `calculateBearing` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the bearing to 0, regardless of the actual value. This could lead to incorrect destination points or bearings when using the `calculateDestination` and `calculateBearing` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
180
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the bearing to 180, regardless of the actual value. This could lead to incorrect destination points or bearings when using the `calculateDestination` and `calculateBearing` methods.
