  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the variable `a` is not equal to the string `'object'`, rather than checking if the type of `a` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the variable `a` is not equal to the `Object` constructor, rather than checking if the type of `a` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the variable `a` is not equal to the string `'object'`, rather than checking if the type of `a` is not an object.

DONE.
