  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, 'image.jpg');

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the basename of the URL as the filename, while this code fragment always uses the string "image.jpg" as the filename.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

options.dest = path.join(options.dest, path.basename(options.url));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the basename of the URL as the filename, while this code fragment uses the basename of the URL as the directory name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, path.basename(options.url).replace('.', '_'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the basename of the URL as the filename, while this code fragment uses the basename of the URL with all dots replaced with undersc
