  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, whereas the original code fragment returns a reference to the original array. This could cause the `push()` method to behave differently if the `policies` array is modified after the `push()` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name !== 'default')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the new array would contain only the policies that have a name that is not 'default'. This could cause the `push()` method to behave differently if the `policies` array contains policies with the name 'default'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the
