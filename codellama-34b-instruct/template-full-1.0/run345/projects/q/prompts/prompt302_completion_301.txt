  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `===` operator, which compares values for equality, while the new code uses the `!==` operator, which compares values for inequality. This means that the new code would return `true` if the values are not equal, which would cause the `if` statement to be entered and the `reject` method to be called, regardless of whether the values being compared are actually equal or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x < y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `===` operator to compare values for equality, while the new code uses the `<` operator to compare values for less than. This means that the new code would return `true` if the value of `x` is less than the value of `y`, regardless of whether the values are equal or not. If the values are equal, the `if` statement would not be entered and the `reject` method would not be called.
