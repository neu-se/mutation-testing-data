 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Date()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is expected to be a function, but `new Date()` creates a Date object, which would cause an error when trying to call it as a function in the line `defer(resolver)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and would cause an error when trying to call it as a function in the line `defer(resolver)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` is a function, but it does not have the same behavior as the `defer` function. Specifically, it does not return an object with `promise`, `resolve`, `fulfill`, `reject`, and `notify` properties, which would cause errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the object returned by the
