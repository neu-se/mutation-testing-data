  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
random value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a random value into the code, which could potentially cause the promise to be rejected due to the random value not being what the code was expecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the promise's value to null, which could potentially cause the promise to be rejected if the code is expecting a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the promise's value to undefined, which could potentially cause the promise to be rejected if the code is expecting a defined value.

DONE.
