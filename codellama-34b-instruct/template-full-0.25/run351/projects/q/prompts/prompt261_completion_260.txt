  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, potentially causing the `deferred.fulfill` method to be called when it should not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would check for strict equality between `resolvedPromise` and the boolean value `true`, potentially causing the `deferred.fulfill` method to be called when it should not be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would check for strict inequality between `resolvedPromise` and the boolean value `false`, potentially causing the `deferred.fulfill` method to be called when it should not be.

DONE.
