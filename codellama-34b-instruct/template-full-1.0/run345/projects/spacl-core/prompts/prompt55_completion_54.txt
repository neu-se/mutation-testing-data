  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '[$1]')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a different set of strings, as the replacement string contains square brackets instead of backslashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.substring(1)}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a different set of strings, as the replacement string contains the substring of the original string starting from the second character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.split('').reverse().join('')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a different set of strings, as the replacement string is the reverse of the original string.

DONE.
