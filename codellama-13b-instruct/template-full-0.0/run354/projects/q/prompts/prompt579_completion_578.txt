  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "next" operator to call the continuer function, while the buggy code fragment uses the "bind" method to create a new function that calls the continuer function. This could result in different behavior if the continuer function has side effects or if it is called with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.call(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "next" operator to call the continuer function, while the buggy code fragment uses the "call" method to call the continuer function. This could result in different behavior if the continuer function has side effects or if it is called with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.apply(continuer, ["next"])
```
This would result in different behavior
