  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the map to contain duplicate keys, which would lead to unexpected behavior when trying to retrieve values from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the map to contain null values, which would lead to unexpected behavior when trying to retrieve values from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the map to contain undefined values, which would lead to unexpected behavior when trying to retrieve values from the map.

DONE.
