  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```SHORT
b*1.001
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a small error in the calculation of the exponential function, which can affect the result of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```SHORT
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the imaginary part of the complex number, which can change the argument of the complex function and the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```SHORT
b+Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a random value to the imaginary part of the complex number, which can change the argument of the complex function and the final result.

DONE.
