  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength = Math.min(length, <PLACEHOLDER>());
```
This would result in different behavior because opLength would be assigned a value of 0, and the loop would exit immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength = Math.min(length, <PLACEHOLDER>(thisOp.insert));
```
This would result in different behavior because the function <PLACEHOLDER> would be called with the incorrect arguments, potentially returning an incorrect value for opLength.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength = Math.min(length, <PLACEHOLDER>(this.ops[thisIter.index]));
```
This would result in different behavior because the function <PLACEHOLDER> would be called with the incorrect arguments, potentially returning an incorrect value for opLength.

DONE.
