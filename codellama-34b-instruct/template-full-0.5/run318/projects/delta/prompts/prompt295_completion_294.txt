  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(0)` returns the next operation with a length of 0, which is not the same as `iter.next()` which returns the next operation with a length of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(-1)` returns the previous operation, which is not the same as `iter.next()` which returns the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(100)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(100)` returns the next 100 operations, which is not the same as `iter.next()` which returns the next operation.

DONE.
