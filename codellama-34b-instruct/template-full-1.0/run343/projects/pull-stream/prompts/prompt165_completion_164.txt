  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)` expects three arguments, while the replacement code fragment `abortCb(cb, null, onAbort)` would only pass two arguments, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)` expects three arguments, while the replacement code fragment `abortCb(cb, undefined, onAbort)` would only pass two arguments, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)` expects an abort object as the second argument, while the replacement code fragment `abortCb(cb, {}, onAbort)` would
