  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `busy`, so the code would behave differently when `busy` is true or false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=` operator assigns a new value to `busy`, so the code would behave differently when `busy` is true or false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy || abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator evaluates to true if either `busy` or `abortCb` is true, so the code would behave differently when `busy` is true or false.

DONE.
