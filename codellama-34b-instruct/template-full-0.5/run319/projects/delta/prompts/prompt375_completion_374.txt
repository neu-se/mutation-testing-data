  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to skip over the next element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to move backward by one element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to move forward by twice the length of the current element in the array.

DONE.
