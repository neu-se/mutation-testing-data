  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastIndexOf` method would return -2, indicating that the substring "\n" was not found in the chunk, even if it is present. As a result, the logic of the program would not be equivalent to the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('a') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastIndexOf` method would return -1, indicating that the substring "a" was not found in the chunk, even if it is present. As a result, the logic of the program would not be equivalent to the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string would never be negative, so the code would never enter the `if` block. As a result, the logic
