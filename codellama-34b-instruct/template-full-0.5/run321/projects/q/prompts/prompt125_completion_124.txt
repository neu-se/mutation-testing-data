  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_hasOwnProperty` is a function, and calling it as a method on `this` would change the value of `this` inside the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object_hasOwnProperty[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `!object_hasOwnProperty[key]` is always `true` if `key` is not a property of `object_hasOwnProperty`, even if `key` is a property of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key) && this[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key)` checks if `key` is a property of `this`, and `this[key]` checks if `key` is a property of
