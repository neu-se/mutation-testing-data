Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the value of `end` directly to `ended`, which means `ended` will only reflect the last value of `end`, potentially losing the previous state of `ended`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical AND operator, which means `ended` will only be true if both `ended` and `end` are true, potentially preventing the function from terminating correctly when `end` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the value of `end`, meaning that `ended` will be true when `end` is false, which could lead to incorrect termination logic in the function.

DONE.
