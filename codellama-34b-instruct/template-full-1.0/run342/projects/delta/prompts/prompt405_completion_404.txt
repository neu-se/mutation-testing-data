  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Omega.getHandler
```
This would result in different behavior because `Omega.getHandler` is not a valid method in the `Delta` class, causing the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op.retain === 'object') ? 'retain' : ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would evaluate to the string 'retain' if the retain property of the op object is an object, causing the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op === 'retain' ? 'insert' : 'delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional operator would evaluate to the string 'insert' if the op variable is equal to 'retain', causing the code to throw an error.

DONE.
