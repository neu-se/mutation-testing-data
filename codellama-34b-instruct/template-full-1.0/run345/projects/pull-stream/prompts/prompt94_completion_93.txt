  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, whereas `null` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is a falsey value, whereas `null` is a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsey value, whereas `null` is a truthy value.

DONE.
