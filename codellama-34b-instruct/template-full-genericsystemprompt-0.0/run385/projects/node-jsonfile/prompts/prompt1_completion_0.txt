  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if `options` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.toString() === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert `options` to a string and then compare it to the string `'string'`, which would always be `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.constructor === String
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `options` is an instance of the `String` constructor, which would always be `false`.

DONE.
