  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude + point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add the two longitude values instead of subtracting them, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude * point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the two longitude values instead of subtracting them, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude / point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator would divide the two longitude values instead of subtracting them, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

DONE.
