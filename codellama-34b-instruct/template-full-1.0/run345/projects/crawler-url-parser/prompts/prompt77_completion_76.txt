  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr + "abc"
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra string "abc" would cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the base URL to be used as the parsed embed URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return `null`, which could lead to unexpected results in the surrounding code.

DONE.
