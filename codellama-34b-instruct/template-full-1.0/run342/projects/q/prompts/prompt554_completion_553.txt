  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise as its first argument, but `null` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise as its first argument, but `undefined` is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to resolve.

DONE.
