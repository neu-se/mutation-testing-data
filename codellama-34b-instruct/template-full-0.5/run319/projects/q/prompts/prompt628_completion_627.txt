  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the `set` method, which would cause an error when the method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the same key is used for both the property name and the property value, which would cause an error when the property is set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, "value"]
```
This would result in different behavior because a string is used as the property value, which would cause an error when the property is set.

DONE.
