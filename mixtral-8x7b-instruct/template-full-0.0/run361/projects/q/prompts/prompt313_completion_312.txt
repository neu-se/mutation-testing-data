 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['then']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `then` property as a string, which would not call the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to call the `then` method on the number `0`, which would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.constructor.prototype.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses the `then` method of the constructor's prototype, even if the current object has overridden it.

DONE.
