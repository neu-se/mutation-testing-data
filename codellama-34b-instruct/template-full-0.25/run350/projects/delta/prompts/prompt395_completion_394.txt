  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is always `undefined` in the original code, so the `if` statement would never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.insert` is always `undefined` in the original code, so the `if` statement would never be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.attributes` is always `undefined` in the original code, so the `if` statement would never be executed.

DONE.
