  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event would be emitted instead of the `load` event, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event would be emitted instead of the `load` event, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read_close` event would be emitted instead of the `load` event, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
