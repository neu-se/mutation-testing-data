  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be decremented by the `length` of the operation, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip over a portion of the text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be multiplied by the `length` of the operation, which would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the text multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex / length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be divided by the `length` of the operation, which would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the text in reverse.

DONE.
