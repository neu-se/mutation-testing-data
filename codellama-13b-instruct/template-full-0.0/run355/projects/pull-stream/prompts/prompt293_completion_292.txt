  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'number' === test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `test` variable is a number, while the new code fragment checks if the `test` variable is equal to the string "number". This would cause the test to fail if the `test` variable is not a number, which could indicate a bug in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `test` variable is a number, while the new code fragment checks if the `test` variable is equal to the string "number". This would cause the test to fail if the `test` variable is not a number, which could indicate a bug in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof test === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `test` variable is a number, while the new code fragment checks
