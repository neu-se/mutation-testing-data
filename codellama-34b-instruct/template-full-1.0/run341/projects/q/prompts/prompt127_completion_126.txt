  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because `key` and `value` are different objects in the `object_keys` function, and `value` is not guaranteed to be defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object` is a global constructor function, and `object_keys` is only meant to work with objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and `object_keys` is only meant to work with objects.

DONE.
