  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to the `dispatch` method, causing the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice(0, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to the `dispatch` method, causing the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice(0, -2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to the `dispatch` method, causing the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
