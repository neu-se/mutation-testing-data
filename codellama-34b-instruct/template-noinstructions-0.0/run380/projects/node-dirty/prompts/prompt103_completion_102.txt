  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is the value associated with the key, while `row.key` is the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string 'foo' to the key, which would cause the `delete` method to fail to find the correct key in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` method to fail to find the correct key in the map, as `null` is not a valid key.

DONE.
