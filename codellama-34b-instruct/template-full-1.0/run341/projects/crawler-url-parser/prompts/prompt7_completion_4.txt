  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current URL has illegal characters, instead of the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!baseUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the base URL is undefined or has illegal characters, and return null if either condition is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && currentUrlStr != baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current URL is not equal to the base URL, and return null if they are not equal.

DONE.
