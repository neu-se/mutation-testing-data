  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejection would only occur if the `pendingCount` is not equal to 0, rather than if it is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejection would only occur if the `pendingCount` is less than 0, rather than if it is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejection would only occur if the length of the `promises` array is greater than 0, rather than if the `pendingCount` is equal to 0.

DONE.
