  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the method to return a different value.

DONE.
