  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter.not()
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter.not()` is not the same as `filter`. The former only filters out elements that satisfy the test, while the latter filters out elements that do not satisfy the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter.negate()
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter.negate()` reverses the sense of the test, so elements that satisfy the test are filtered out, while elements that do not satisfy the test are kept.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter.filter()
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter.filter()` expects a callback function that returns a truthy value for elements that should be included in the output, and a falsy value for elements that should be filtered out. The original code fragment does not pass a callback function, so this would result in different behavior.

DONE.
