  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function call at runtime, which could potentially have different performance characteristics or behavior depending on the implementation of the `call` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty(object[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has a property with a key that corresponds to the value of the property being checked, which could potentially produce different results if the object's properties are not string values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty("props")[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has a property named "props", and if it does, it would return the value of that property. If the object does not have a property named "props", it would return `undefined`. This could potentially produce different results if the object does
