  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a reserved word in JavaScript, and using it as a variable name would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method of the `Delta` class, and using it as a variable name would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method of the `Delta` class, and using it as a variable name would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
