Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `null` to the global `Q` variable instead of the intended `definition`, leading to a situation where the `Q` API is not available for use.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `undefined` to the global `Q` variable, which would also make the `Q` API unavailable, similar to the first option, but explicitly indicates that `Q` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return "error"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `Q` API with a function that always returns the string "error", which would not provide the expected promise functionality and could lead to unexpected results in promise handling.

DONE.
