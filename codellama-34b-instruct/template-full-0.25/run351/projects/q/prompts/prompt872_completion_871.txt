  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will always return a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library that can return a resolved or rejected promise depending on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a deferred object that can be used to create a promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library that can return a resolved or rejected promise depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` will always return a resolved promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library that can return a resolved or rejected promise depending on the input.

DONE.
