  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num == 1 || num === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `num` is not equal to 1 or is undefined, while this replacement checks whether `num` is equal to 1 or is undefined. This would cause the function to return the plural form of the word even if `num` is equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num == 1 && num === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `num` is not equal to 1 or is undefined, while this replacement checks whether `num` is equal to 1 and is undefined at the same time. This would cause the function to never return the plural form of the word, as the condition is always false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num != 1 || num !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `num` is not equal to
