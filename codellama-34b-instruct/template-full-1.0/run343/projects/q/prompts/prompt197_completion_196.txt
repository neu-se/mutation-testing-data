  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "foo" to the end of the `stackLine` variable, which would change the resulting stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the `stackLine` variable, which would change the resulting stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the first character from the `stackLine` variable, which would change the resulting stack trace.

DONE.
