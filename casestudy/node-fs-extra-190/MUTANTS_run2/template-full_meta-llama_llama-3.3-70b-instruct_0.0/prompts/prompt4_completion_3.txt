Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!clobber
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, so the file would be deleted when `clobber` is false, and not deleted when `clobber` is true, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always deletes the destination file if it exists, regardless of the value of `clobber`, which could lead to unintended data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clobber === 'true'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `clobber` is the string 'true' instead of a boolean true, which could lead to the destination file not being deleted even when `clobber` is intended to be true, but is not a boolean value.

DONE.
