  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch["delete"](key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square bracket notation would allow the code to access the `delete` property of the `dispatch` method, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with a single argument (the key), which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property would be accessed directly from the `dispatch` method, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
