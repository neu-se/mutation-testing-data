  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Unexpected EOF')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment raises an error when encountering empty lines in the database, whereas the replacement code fragment raises an error when encountering an unexpected end of file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Corrupted database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment raises an error when encountering empty lines in the database, whereas the replacement code fragment raises an error when the database is corrupted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Unexpected token')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment raises an error when encountering empty lines in the database, whereas the replacement code fragment raises an error when encountering an unexpected token.

DONE.
