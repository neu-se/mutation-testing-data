Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () { setTimeout(flush, 1000); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delay before the `flush` function is called from 0 milliseconds to 1000 milliseconds, potentially causing tasks to be executed later than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () { flush(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `flush` immediately instead of scheduling it to run asynchronously, which could lead to stack overflow or blocking behavior in the event loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () { setTimeout(function() { throw new Error("Test Error"); }, 0); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an error that will be thrown asynchronously, which could disrupt the normal flow of execution and potentially lead to unhandled exceptions.

DONE.
