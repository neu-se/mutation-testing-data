  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `nbind` method, whereas `this` refers to the `Promise.prototype` object, which does have a `nbind` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `nbind` method, whereas `this` refers to the `Promise.prototype` object, which does have a `nbind` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a resolved promise, whereas `this` refers to the `Promise.prototype` object, which is a pending promise.

DONE.
