  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function expects a country ID as an argument, while the `getTimezone` function expects a timezone name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountryForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function expects a timezone name as an argument, while the `getCountry` function expects a country ID.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesForCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesForCountry` function expects a country ID as an argument, while the `getCountry` function expects a timezone name.

DONE.
