  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` callback would be called with an error value, which would lead to the promise being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` callback would be called without any value, which would lead to the promise being resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(new Error("rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` callback would be called with a new error value, which would lead to the promise being rejected.

DONE.
