  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback` is a function that is only called when an error is encountered, whereas `callback` is a function that is called for both success and error cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and therefore would not be called in the same way as `callback` or `errback`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { return callback(null, result.value) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function that wraps around the original `callback` function, and returns a different value than the original code. The original code would call `callback` with the `result` value, while this new function would call `callback` with `null` as the first argument and the `result` value as the second argument.

DONE.
