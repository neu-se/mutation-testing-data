  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator index would be incremented by 1, potentially skipping the next element in the Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator index would be decremented by 1, potentially looping back to the previous element in the Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator index would be incremented by 2, potentially skipping over two elements in the Delta.

DONE.
