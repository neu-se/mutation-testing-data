  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method would return `undefined` instead of the next operation in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method would return the previous operation instead of the next one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method would return the next operation after the current one, skipping the current operation.

DONE.
