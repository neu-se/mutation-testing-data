  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, so the loop would iterate over the policies in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the array, so the loop would iterate over a different array than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.filter((policy) => policy.name === 'policy1'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method filters the array to only include policies with the name 'policy1', so the loop would only iterate over policies with that name.

DONE.
