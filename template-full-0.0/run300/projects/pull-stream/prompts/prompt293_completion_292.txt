  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `test` is a number, while this new code fragment checks if `test` is a string. This change would cause the function to behave differently for inputs that are not numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `test` is a number, while this new code fragment checks if `test` is null. This change would cause the function to behave differently for inputs that are null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `test` is a number, while this new code fragment checks if `test` is undefined. This change would cause the function to behave differently for inputs that are undefined.

DONE.
