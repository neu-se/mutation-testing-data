  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i.test(w)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.test()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the regular expression pattern matches the given string, whereas the original code fragment uses the regular expression pattern to replace the string with the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.match(/x$|ch$|s$/i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.match()` method returns an array of matches, whereas the original code fragment uses the regular expression pattern to replace the string with the plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/x$|ch$|s$/i, 'es')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.replace()` method replaces the first occurrence of the regular expression pattern in the string with the replacement string, whereas the original code fragment uses the regular expression pattern to replace the string with the plural
