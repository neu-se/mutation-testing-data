  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` returns a function that takes a promise as an argument, whereas `universalify.fromCallback` returns a function that takes a callback as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` returns a function that takes a callback as an argument, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` returns a function that takes a promise as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromStream` returns a function that takes a stream as an argument, whereas `universalify.fromCallback` and `universalify.fromPromise` return functions that take a callback or a promise as an argument, respectively.

DONE.
