  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to exit with an error code of 1, rather than the expected behavior of exiting with an error code of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to exit with an error code of 2, rather than the expected behavior of exiting with an error code of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(3);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to exit with an error code of 3, rather than the expected behavior of exiting with an error code of 0.

DONE.
