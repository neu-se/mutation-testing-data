  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timeout` is equal to `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is not equal to `undefined`. This would cause the `setTimeout` function to be called even if `timeout` is not provided, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timeout` is equal to `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is equal to `null`. This would cause the `setTimeout` function to be called even if `timeout` is `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
