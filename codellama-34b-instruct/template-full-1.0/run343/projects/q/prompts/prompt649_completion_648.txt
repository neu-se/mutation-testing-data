  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is not defined for the `Promise.prototype` and will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is not defined for the `Promise.prototype` and will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is not defined for the `Promise.prototype` and will throw an error.

DONE.
