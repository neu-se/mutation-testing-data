  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument passed to the `pull` function, `read`, would be skipped and the second argument, which is `ref[1]`, would be used as the first argument to the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first two arguments passed to the `pull` function, `read` and `ref[1]`, would be skipped and the third argument, which is `ref[2]`, would be used as the first argument to the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` variable is a function that takes the `ref` object as its argument, and `read.source` would return the source of the function, which is not what the `pull` function expects as its first argument.
