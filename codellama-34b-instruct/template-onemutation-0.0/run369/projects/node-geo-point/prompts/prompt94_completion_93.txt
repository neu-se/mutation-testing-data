  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse cosine function, while `asin` is the inverse sine function. In the context of the code, `acos` would return the wrong value for `Ï†2`, leading to incorrect calculations for the destination point.

DONE.
