  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This change will cause the `options.dest` variable to be set to the basename of the `options.url` variable, rather than the full path. This could potentially cause the `request` function to fail if it is expecting a full path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This change will cause the `options.dest` variable to be set to the directory name of the `options.url` variable, rather than the full path. This could potentially cause the `request` function to fail if it is expecting a full path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This change will cause the `options.dest` variable to be set to the extension of the `options.url` variable, rather than the full path. This could potentially cause the `request` function to fail if it is expecting a full path.

DONE.
