  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method takes no arguments, and passing `length` as an argument would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the current op, and passing `-1` as an argument would cause the method to return a negative length, which would be invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the current op, and passing the length of the other iterator as an argument would cause the method to return a different length, which would affect the behavior of the `transform` method.

DONE.
