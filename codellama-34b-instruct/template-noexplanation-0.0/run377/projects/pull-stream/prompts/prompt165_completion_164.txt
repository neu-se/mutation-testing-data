  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This code fragment is a direct replacement for the original code fragment, but it has a different behavior. The `abortCb` function is called with the `cb` function as its first argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(cb, abort)
```
This code fragment is a different function call than the original code fragment. The `onAbort` function is called with the `cb` function as its first argument, and the `abort` function is called with the `onAbort` function as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This code fragment is the same as the first option, but it has a different indentation and formatting.

DONE.
