  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the current operation in `thisIter` is a `delete`, while replacing it with `otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'` would check if the current operation in `otherIter` is an `insert`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the current operation in `thisIter` is a `delete`, while replacing it with `typeof thisOp.delete === 'number'` would check if the current operation in `thisIter` is a `delete` and its `delete` attribute is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = otherIter.next();
otherOp && typeof otherOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the current
