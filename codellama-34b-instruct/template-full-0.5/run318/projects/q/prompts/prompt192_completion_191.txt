  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(")", "(")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the regular expression to not match the stack line, leading to an incorrect parsing of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace("(", ")")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the regular expression to not match the stack line, leading to an incorrect parsing of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace("@", " ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the regular expression to not match the stack line, leading to an incorrect parsing of the stack trace.

DONE.
