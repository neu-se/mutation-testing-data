  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` replaces all occurrences of the search string, whereas `replace` only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^\n/g` matches the start of the string, whereas the original code fragment matches any occurrence of `\n`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\n/g` matches any occurrence of `\n`, whereas the original code fragment matches the start of the string.

DONE.
