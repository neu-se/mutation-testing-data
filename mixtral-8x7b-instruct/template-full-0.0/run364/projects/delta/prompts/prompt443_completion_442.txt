 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.insert.length - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the remaining string after the `offset` instead of the substring itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.insert.substr(offset, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a substring of length 1, even if the remaining string is longer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.insert.substr(0, length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a substring from the beginning of the `insert` string with the specified `length`, instead of starting at the `offset`.

By introducing these changes, we can expose potential weaknesses in the test suite, as the modified code may not be covered by existing tests or may produce unexpected results. DONE.
