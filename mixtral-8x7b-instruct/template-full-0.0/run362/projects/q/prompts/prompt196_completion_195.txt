 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInternalFrame` function would start returning `true` for all stack lines, causing the `filterStackString` function to only keep the last stack line, which might not provide enough information to locate the source of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `[undefined, NaN]`, causing the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `false`, which would result in no filtering of the stack trace, including Node and Q cruft.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => 'some file.js:10'
