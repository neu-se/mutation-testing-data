  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, object]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` parameter is added to the array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array is reversed, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive the arguments in a different order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.concat(object)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` parameter is concatenated to the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

DONE.
