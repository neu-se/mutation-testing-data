  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    throw new Error("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.reject("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value of `promise`.

DONE.
