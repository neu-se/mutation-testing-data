  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the object is not an instance of `Complex`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor === Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the object is an instance of `Complex` and its constructor is the `Complex` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(this) === Complex.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the object is an instance of `Complex` and its prototype is the `Complex.prototype` object.

DONE.
