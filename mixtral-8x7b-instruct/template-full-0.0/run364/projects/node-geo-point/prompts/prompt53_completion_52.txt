 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(θ) * Math.cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of operations in calculating `y`, which can lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(θ) * Math.cos(δ) * Math.cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an extra `Math.cos(δ)` factor in calculating `y`, which can lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(θ) * Math.cos(φ1) * Math.cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an extra `Math.cos(φ1) * Math.cos(φ2)` factor in calculating `y`, which can lead to
