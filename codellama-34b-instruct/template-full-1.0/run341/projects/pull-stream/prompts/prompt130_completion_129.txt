  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is returned when `end` is truthy, but `undefined` is returned when `end` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is returned when `end` is truthy, but `undefined` is returned when `end` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `Infinity` is returned when `i > max`, but in the modified code, `i` is returned instead.

DONE.
