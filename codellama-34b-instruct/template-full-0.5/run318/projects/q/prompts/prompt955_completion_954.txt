  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail()` method is called on the result of `fapply()`, which is a promise, instead of being called on the original promise `Q(callback)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then()` method is called on the result of `fapply()`, which is a promise, instead of being called on the original promise `Q(callback)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(function (value) {
    deferred.resolve(value);
}, function (error) {
    deferred.reject(error);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then()` method is called on the
