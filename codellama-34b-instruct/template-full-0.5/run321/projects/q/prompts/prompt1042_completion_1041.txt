This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise, but it does not return the value of the promise. In the original code, `get` is called on the promise returned by `ends.promise`, which returns the value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.catch

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the promise returned by `ends.promise`, but it does not return the
