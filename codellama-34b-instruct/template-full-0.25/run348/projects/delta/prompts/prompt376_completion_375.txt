  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, whereas the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `!==` operator would cause the code to behave differently than the original code, potentially leading to a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, whereas the `==` operator checks for loose equality. In this case, the `===` operator would cause the code to behave differently than the original code, potentially leading to a bug.
