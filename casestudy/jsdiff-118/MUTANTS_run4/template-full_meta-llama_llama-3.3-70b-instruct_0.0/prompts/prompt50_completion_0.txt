Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
hunk.oldLines == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the number of old lines in the hunk is zero instead of the number of new lines, potentially causing incorrect offset adjustments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
hunk.newLines > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the number of new lines in the hunk is greater than zero instead of equal to zero, potentially causing incorrect offset adjustments when there are new lines to be added.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
hunk.newStart === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the new start line of the hunk is equal to 1 instead of checking the number of new lines, potentially causing incorrect offset adjustments based on the start position of the hunk.

DONE.
