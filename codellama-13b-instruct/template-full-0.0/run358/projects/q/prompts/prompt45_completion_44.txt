  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.exit()` function is called before the `runSingle()` function, which would cause the `task` function to be executed in the context of the `domain` object, rather than the global context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.enter()` function is called after the `runSingle()` function, which would cause the `task` function to be executed in the context of the `domain` object, rather than the global context.

DONE.
