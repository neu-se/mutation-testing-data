  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the length of the `args` array instead of the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the first element of the `args` array instead of the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a copy of the `args` array instead of the array itself.

DONE.
