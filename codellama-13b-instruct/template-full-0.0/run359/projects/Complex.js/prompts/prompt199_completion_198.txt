  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function is used to calculate the power of two complex numbers, while the original code fragment uses a different formula to calculate the power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root of a complex number, while the original code fragment uses a different formula to calculate the square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.log` function is used to calculate the logarithm of a complex number, while the original code fragment uses a different formula to calculate the logarithm.

DONE.
