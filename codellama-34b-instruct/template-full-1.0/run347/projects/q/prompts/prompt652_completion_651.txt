  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the `name` argument in the `array_slice` function, which would cause the `array_slice` function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first two elements of the `arguments` array, instead of the first three, as the original code fragment did.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["foo", array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `name` argument with the string `"foo"` and include only the `arguments` from the fourth position onwards, instead of from the third position onwards as the original code fragment did.

DONE.
