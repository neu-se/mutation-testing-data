  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a null value instead of the expected event object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event instead of the expected event object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a drain event with a value of 0 instead of the expected event object.

DONE.
