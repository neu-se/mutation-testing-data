  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error()` would cause an error to be thrown, whereas `fulfill` would cause the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <anything other than a promise>
```
This would result in different behavior because `return <anything other than a promise>` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the returned value, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled with the value passed to it.

DONE.
