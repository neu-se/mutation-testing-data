  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` checks for deep equality, while `!==` checks for reference inequality. This means that if `newOp.attributes` and `lastOp.attributes` have the same keys and values, but are not the same object reference, the `isEqual` check would pass, while the `!==` check would fail.

DONE.
