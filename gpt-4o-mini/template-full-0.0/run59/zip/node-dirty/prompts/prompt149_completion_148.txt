Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly iterates over `this._queue` instead of `cbs`, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior since `this._queue` is not guaranteed to contain the same callbacks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it starts iterating from the second element of `cbs`, effectively skipping the first callback and potentially causing some operations to not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.concat(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a `null` value to the end of the `cbs` array, which would cause an error when trying to invoke `cb(null)` if `cb` is not designed to handle `null` as an argument.

DONE.
