Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially causing the subsequent logic to operate on the same operation repeatedly instead of moving forward in the sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(1)` advances the iterator by one operation, which may not correspond to the expected length of the operation being processed, leading to incorrect handling of the operations in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(0)` would effectively do nothing and not advance the iterator, which could lead to an infinite loop or incorrect composition of operations since the same operation would be processed repeatedly without moving to the next one.

DONE.
