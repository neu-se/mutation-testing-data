Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logical operator from OR (`||`) to AND (`&&`), meaning that the condition will only be true if both `this` is zero and `z` is infinite, which is a stricter requirement than the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates both conditions, meaning that the code will now return `Complex['ZERO']` only if `this` is not zero and `z` is not infinite, which is the opposite of the original intent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is zero, which would allow the code to return `Complex['ZERO']` under different circumstances than the original condition, potentially leading to incorrect results in division.
