  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` returns a promise that is fulfilled when all promises in the array are fulfilled, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is fulfilled with the first promise in the array that is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.any()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.any()` returns a promise that is fulfilled when any promise in the array is fulfilled, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is fulfilled with the first promise in the array that is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.allSettled()` returns a promise that is fulfilled when all promises in the array are settled, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is fulfilled with the first promise in the array that is fulfilled.

DONE.
