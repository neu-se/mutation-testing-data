  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `=`, so it would negate the value of `prop` instead of assigning a new value to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `=`, so it would add 1 to the value of `prop` instead of assigning a new value to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `=`, so it would add 1 to the value of `prop` instead of assigning a new value to it.

DONE.
