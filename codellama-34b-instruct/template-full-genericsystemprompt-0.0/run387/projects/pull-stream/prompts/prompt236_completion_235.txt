  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the loop to continue even if the `end` variable is set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is decremented by 1, which would cause the loop to exit even if the `end` variable is set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is negated, which would cause the loop to exit if the `end` variable is set to `true`, and continue if the `end` variable is set to `false`.

DONE.
