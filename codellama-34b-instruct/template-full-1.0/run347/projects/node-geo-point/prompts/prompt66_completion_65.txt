  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function is used to compute the arc tangent of y / x, but `Math.atan2` computes the arc tangent of 2y / x.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function is used to compute the arc cosine of a value, but `Math.acos` computes the arc cosine of the absolute value of the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asin` function is used to compute the arc sine of a value, but `Math.asin` computes the arc sine of the absolute value of the argument.

DONE.
