  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not be able to store the value in the `_queue` map, as the key would be `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not be able to store the value in the `_queue` map, as the key would be `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not be able to store the value in the `_queue` map, as the key would be an empty string.

DONE.
