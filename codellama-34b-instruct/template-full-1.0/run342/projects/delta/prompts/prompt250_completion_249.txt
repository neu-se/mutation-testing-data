  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.ops.length - otherIter.position
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength` checks the length of the current operation, while `otherIter.ops.length - otherIter.position` checks the length of the entire operations array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.position + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.position` is the current position in the iterator, not the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.current.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.current.length` would check the length of the current operation, while `otherIter.peekLength` checks the length of the current operation and any remaining operations in the array.

DONE.
