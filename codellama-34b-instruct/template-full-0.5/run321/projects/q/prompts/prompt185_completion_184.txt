  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third element of the `attempt1` array, which may not exist or may have a different value than the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `attempt2` array, which may not exist or may have a different value than the second element of the `attempt1` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] + attempt2[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the first element of the `attempt1` array and the second element of the `attempt2` array, which may not exist or may have different values than the second element of the `attempt1` array.

DONE.
