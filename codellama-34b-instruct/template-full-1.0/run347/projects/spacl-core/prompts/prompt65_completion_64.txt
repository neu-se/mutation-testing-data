  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could potentially change the outcome of the policy query.
Respectively, Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules + [new Rule('', '', '')]
```
This could result in different behavior if the `Rule` class does not have default values for its parameters, and the developers failed to set appropriate values for the new instance of the `Rule` class.
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
[]
```
This could result in different behavior if the policy is designed to allow certain actions by default, and the empty array would override that default behavior.

Please elaborate on how these changes could impact the behavior of the policy query.
