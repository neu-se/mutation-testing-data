  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method call, while `chop` is a method definition with no correct end, thus causing a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.diff
```
This would result in different behavior because `diff` is a method that compares two Delta objects, while `chop` is a method that removes redundant retain operations from a Delta object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that combines two Delta objects, while `chop` is a method that removes redundant retain operations from a Delta object.
