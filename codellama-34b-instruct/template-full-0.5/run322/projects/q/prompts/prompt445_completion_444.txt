  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not trigger the "unhandledRejection" event in the process object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass the promise as the third argument to the "unhandledRejection" event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", null, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass the reason as the second argument to the "unhandledRejection" event.

DONE.
