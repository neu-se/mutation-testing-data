  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the same word instead of the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the plural form of the word, but the rule would not be added to the list of rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos', true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the plural form of the word and the rule would be added to the list of rules, but the rule would be added with a third argument that is not a function.

DONE.
