  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n").join("\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace by newlines and then join them with the separator, which would result in a different stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.replace(/\n/g, STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all newlines in the stack trace with the separator, which would result in a different stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.substring(0, concatedStacks.length - 1) + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the stack trace and add the separator, which would result in a different stack trace.
