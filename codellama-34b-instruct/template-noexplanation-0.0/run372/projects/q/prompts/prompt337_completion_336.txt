  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This code fragment checks if the promise is in the "fulfilled" state, which means that it has been resolved successfully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This code fragment checks if the promise is in the "pending" state, which means that it is still being processed and has not yet been resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This code fragment checks if the promise is in the "rejected" state, which means that it has been rejected and an error has occurred.

DONE.
