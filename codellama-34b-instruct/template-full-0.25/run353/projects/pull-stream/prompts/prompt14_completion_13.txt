  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate, causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the loop.

DONE.
