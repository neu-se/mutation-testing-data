  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the check for node frames and internal frames, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line && !isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra check for the line being truthy, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line && !isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line.indexOf("qFileName") >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra check for the line containing the string "qFileName", which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
