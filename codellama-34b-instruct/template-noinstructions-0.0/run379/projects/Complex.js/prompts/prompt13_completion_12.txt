  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b || x < -b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if x is outside the range of -b to b, while the new code fragment checks if x is greater than b or less than -b.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b && x < -b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if x is outside the range of -b to b, while the new code fragment checks if x is greater than b and less than -b.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b || x < -b || x == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if x is outside the range of -b to b, while the new code fragment checks if x is greater than b, less than -b, or equal to 0.

DONE.
