  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it could cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error if the `reviver` function is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object `{}` is not the same as `null`, and it could cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error if the `reviver` function is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a function `function() {}` is not the same as `null`, and it could cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error if the `reviver` function is not defined.

DONE.
