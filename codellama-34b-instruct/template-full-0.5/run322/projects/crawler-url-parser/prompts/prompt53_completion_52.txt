  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.path` would be used as the second argument to `URL.resolve`, which would cause the resulting URL to be different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.hostname` would be used as the second argument to `URL.resolve`, which would cause the resulting URL to be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.protocol` would be used as the second argument to `URL.resolve`, which would cause the resulting URL to be different from the original code.

DONE.
