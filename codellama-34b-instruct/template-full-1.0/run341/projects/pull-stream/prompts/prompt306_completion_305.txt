  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a function that takes an item as an argument and returns a boolean representing whether the item passes the test. By calling `test(end)`, we are checking if the `end` value passed to the function passes the test, whereas the original code was checking if `ended` or `end` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if `ended` or `end` is truthy, but this code is checking if `ended` is truthy and `end` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || !ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if `ended` or `end` is truthy, but this code is checking if `end` is truthy or `ended` is falsy.

DONE.
