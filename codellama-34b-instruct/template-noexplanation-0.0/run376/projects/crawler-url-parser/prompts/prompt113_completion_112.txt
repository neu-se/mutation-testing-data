  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This code fragment will return an iterator over the keys of the `urlMap` object, which are the URLs that have been extracted from the HTML.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This code fragment will return an iterator over the key-value pairs of the `urlMap` object, which are the URLs and their corresponding `currentUrl` objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values().filter(url => url.startsWith('http'))
```
This code fragment will return an iterator over the values of the `urlMap` object that start with the string "http".

DONE.
