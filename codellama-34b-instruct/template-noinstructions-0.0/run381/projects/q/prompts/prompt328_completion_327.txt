  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.promiseDispatch(resolve, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `promise` object, which is not the same as calling the `promiseDispatch` method on the `Promise` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.promiseDispatch.call(promise, resolve, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `Promise` prototype, which is not the same as calling the `promiseDispatch` method on the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.promiseDispatch.apply(promise, [resolve, op, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `Promise` prototype with the `promise` object as the `
