  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const thisData = thisOp.retain;
const otherData = otherOp.retain;
let transformedData: Op['retain'] =
  typeof otherData === 'object' && otherData !== null
    ? otherData
    : length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformedData` variable would be initialized to a different value, depending on the type of `otherData`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const thisData = thisOp.retain;
const otherData = otherOp.retain;
let transformedData: Op['retain'] =
  typeof thisData === 'object' && thisData !== null
    ? thisData
    : length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformedData` variable would be initialized to a different value, depending on the type of `thisData`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const thisData = thisOp.retain;
