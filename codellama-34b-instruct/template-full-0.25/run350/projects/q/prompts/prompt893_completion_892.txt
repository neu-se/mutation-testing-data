  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is not called with the correct `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is not called with any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a different function is called instead of the original `callback`.

DONE.
