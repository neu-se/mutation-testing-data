  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `deferred.notify` is a function that notifies the promise with the given reason. Using `deferred.reject` instead of `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be rejected, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
