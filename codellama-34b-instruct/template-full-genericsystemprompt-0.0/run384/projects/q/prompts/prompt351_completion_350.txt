  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self,
```
This would result in different behavior because the `self` variable is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, this,
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, rather than the `self` variable, which is defined in the current scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, null,
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and would not have the same behavior as the `self` variable, which is an object.

DONE.
