 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => deferred.reject('HACKED')
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection would include the string 'HACKED' instead of the original error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of rejected.

DONE.
