  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be longer than 0, causing the function to be executed later than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, -1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be negative, causing the function to be executed immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be 0, causing the function to be executed immediately.

DONE.
