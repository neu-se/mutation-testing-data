Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.special !== Special.None && (c === "x" || c === "X")
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this.special` is not equal to `Special.None` and if the character `c` is either "x" or "X", which is different from the original condition that checks if `this.special` is equal to `Special.Title` and if the character `c` is either "t" or "T".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!this.xmlMode && (c === "s" || c === "S")
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this.xmlMode` is false and if the character `c` is either "s" or "S", which is different from the original condition that checks if `this.special` is equal to `Special.Title` and if the character `c` is either "t" or "T".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.decodeEntities && (c === "d" || c === "D")
```
This would result
