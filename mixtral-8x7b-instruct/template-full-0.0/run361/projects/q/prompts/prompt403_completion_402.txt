 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` creates a new rejected promise, while the original code throws an error which can be caught and handled by a subsequent promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when.bind(null, promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` wraps the `promise` in a new promise, and the `bind` call creates a new function that, when called, will reject the promise with the provided `reason`. This is different from the original code, which throws an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` creates a new promise that is resolved with the `promise` as its value, and then the `thenReject` method is called on the new promise. This is different from the
