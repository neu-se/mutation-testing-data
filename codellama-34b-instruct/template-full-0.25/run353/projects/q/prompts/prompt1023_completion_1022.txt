  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nodeify` expects a callback function as its second argument, but `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nodeify` expects a callback function as its second argument, but an empty function is not a valid callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(function(error) { console.log(error); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nodeify` expects a callback function as its second argument, but a callback function that only logs its argument is not equivalent to the original code.

DONE.
