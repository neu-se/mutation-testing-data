  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, cb || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `read` with the `abort` argument, while this new code fragment also passes the `cb` argument, which could potentially cause the `read` function to behave differently.
