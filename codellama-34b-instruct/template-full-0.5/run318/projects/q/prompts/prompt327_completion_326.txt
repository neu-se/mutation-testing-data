  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `args` array as a whole, while this replacement uses only the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `args` array as a whole, while this replacement uses all elements of the array except the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `args` array as a whole, while this replacement uses only the length of the array.

DONE.
