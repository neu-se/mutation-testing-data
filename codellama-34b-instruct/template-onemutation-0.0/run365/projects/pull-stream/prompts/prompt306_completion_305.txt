  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to `true` when `end` is `true`, regardless of the current value of `ended`. In the original code, `ended` is only set to `true` when `end` is `true` and `ended` is currently `false`.
