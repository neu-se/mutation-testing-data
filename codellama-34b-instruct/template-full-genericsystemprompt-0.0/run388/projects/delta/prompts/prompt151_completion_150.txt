  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.delete - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different property than `retain`, and would result in a different calculation for the length of the retained text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the length of the retained text to the length of the deleted text, resulting in a different calculation for the length of the retained text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain * firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the length of the retained text by the length of the deleted text, resulting in a different calculation for the length of the retained text.

DONE.
