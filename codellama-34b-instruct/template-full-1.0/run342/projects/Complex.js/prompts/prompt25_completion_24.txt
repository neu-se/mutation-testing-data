  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 1 - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the input values, causing the square root to always return a negative value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 1 + Math.sqrt(b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the square root of the input values to 1, causing the result to always be greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 b * b / 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the square of the input values by 10, causing the result to always be smaller than the original.

DONE.
