  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected, potentially changing the outcome of the `allResolved` function.

DONE.
