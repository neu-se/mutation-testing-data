  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would always return `null`, causing the `buildCountry` function to return `null` for all countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would always return an empty object, causing the `buildCountry` function to return an empty object for all countries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would always return `undefined`, causing the `buildCountry` function to return `undefined` for all countries.

DONE.
