  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on('error', reject)` event would be called twice, once for the `zipArchive` and once for the `output` stream, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('finish', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on('finish', resolve)` event would be called twice, once for the `zipArchive` and once for the `output` stream, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('close', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on('close', resolve)` event would be called twice, once for the `zipArchive` and once for the `output` stream, which could cause the test to fail.
