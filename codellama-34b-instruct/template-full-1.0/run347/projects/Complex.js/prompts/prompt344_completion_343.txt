  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b;
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * b` is not the same as `b`. `b * b` is the square of `b`, while `b` is the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a;
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * a` is not the same as `b`. `b * a` is the product of `b` and `a`, while `b` is the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b;
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is not the same as `b`. `a + b` is the sum of `a` and `b`, while `b` is the value of `b`.

DONE.
