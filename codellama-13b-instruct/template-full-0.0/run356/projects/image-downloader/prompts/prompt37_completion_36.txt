  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string as the file path would cause the `createWriteStream` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value as the file path would cause the `createWriteStream` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value as the file path would cause the `createWriteStream` method to throw an error.

DONE.
