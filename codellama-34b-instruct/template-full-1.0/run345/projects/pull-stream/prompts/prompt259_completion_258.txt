  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a function that aborts the current stream, whereas `nextStream` is a function that is called when the stream is not ended. If `abort` is called instead of `nextStream`, it will abort the current stream and the stream of streams, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function(data) {
  cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `read` with a null value for the first argument, which is not the same as calling it with the `abort` error that was passed to the function. Additionally, it would call `cb` with the `data` argument, which may not be the same as calling it with the `err` argument that was passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function(err
