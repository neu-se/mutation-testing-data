  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it is not a string. This would cause the code to behave differently for non-string `options` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it has a non-zero length. This would cause the code to behave differently for non-string `options` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.toString() !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if its string representation is not equal to the string `'string'`. This would cause the code to behave differently for non-string `options`
