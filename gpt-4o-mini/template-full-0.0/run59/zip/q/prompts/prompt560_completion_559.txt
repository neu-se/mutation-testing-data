Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exception === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the exception is a string instead of checking if it is a `StopIteration` exception, which would cause the code to incorrectly handle exceptions that are not related to generator control flow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception instanceof Error
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the exception is an instance of the `Error` class, which would lead to the code incorrectly treating all errors as `StopIteration`, potentially causing the generator to terminate prematurely on any error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the exception is `null`, which is not a valid check for a `StopIteration` exception, leading to the generator not being able to properly handle the end of iteration and potentially causing unexpected behavior in the promise resolution.

DONE.
