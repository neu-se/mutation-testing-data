 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the test `rule[0].test(word)` would be skipped, and the function would return the word with 's' appended regardless of the rule matching.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `rule[1]` would not be called, and the function would return the word with 's' appended regardless of the rule matching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `rule[0] === word` would always be false, and the function would return the word with 's' appended regardless of the rule matching.

DONE.
