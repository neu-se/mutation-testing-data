  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, !data
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the `data` variable, which means that the resulting `data` would be `null` or `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 10 to the `data` variable, which means that the resulting `data` would be different from the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it divides the `data` variable by zero, which means that the resulting `data` would be `NaN` instead of the original value.

DONE.
