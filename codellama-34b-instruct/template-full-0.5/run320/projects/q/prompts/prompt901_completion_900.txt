  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is used to resolve or reject the promise, while this new code fragment simply calls `deferred.reject()` with the `error` object. This would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the Node function to complete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is used to resolve or reject the promise, while this new code fragment simply calls `deferred.resolve()` with the `value` object. This would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, rather than waiting for the Node function to complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
