  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would be called with a non-integer exponent, which would cause the result to be a non-integer value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would be called with a non-integer exponent, which would cause the result to be a non-integer value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would be called with a different base value, which would cause the result to be a different value.

DONE.
