  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `then()` is a method that returns a new promise, while `get()` is a method that retrieves the value of a promise. Using `then()` would cause the `get()` method to never be called, leading to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended.promise.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch()` is a method that returns a new promise, while `get()` is a method that retrieves the value of a promise. Using `catch()` would cause the `get()` method to never be called, leading to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject()` is a method that rejects a promise, while `get()` is a method that retrieves the value of a promise. Using `reject()` would
