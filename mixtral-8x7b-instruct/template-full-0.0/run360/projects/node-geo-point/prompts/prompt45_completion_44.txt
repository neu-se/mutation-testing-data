 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a distance of 0, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
r + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the result, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the absolute value of r, which could change the result if r is negative.

DONE.
