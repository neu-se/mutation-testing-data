  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).filter(key => attributes[key] != null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out keys that have a value of `null`, potentially altering the composition of the `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(attributes).filter(value => value != null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out values that have a value of `null`, potentially altering the composition of the `attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(attributes).filter(entry => entry[1] != null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out entries whose value is `null`, potentially altering the composition of the `attributes` object.

DONE.
