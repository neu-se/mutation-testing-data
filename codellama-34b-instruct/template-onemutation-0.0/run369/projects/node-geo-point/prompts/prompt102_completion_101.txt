  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(λ2) + 540
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function is not defined in the code snippet, and the `λ2` variable is not defined either. The `rad2deg` function is likely a function that converts radians to degrees, and the `λ2` variable is likely a longitude value in radians. The code snippet is trying to calculate the longitude value in degrees, but the `rad2deg` function is not defined, so the code will not work as intended.

DONE.
