  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index >= length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to run indefinitely, as the condition `index < length` would always be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index < 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to never run, as the condition `index < length` would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index == length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to run one more time than it should, as the condition `index < length` would be false.

DONE.
