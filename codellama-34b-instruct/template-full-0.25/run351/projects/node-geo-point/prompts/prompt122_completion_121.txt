  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword to refer to the current instance of the `GeoPoint` class, while the new code fragment would be using the `null` keyword, which would cause the `calculateBearing` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword to refer to the current instance of the `GeoPoint` class, while the new code fragment would be using the `undefined` keyword, which would cause the `calculateBearing` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword to refer to the current instance of the `GeoPoint` class, while the new code fragment would be creating a
