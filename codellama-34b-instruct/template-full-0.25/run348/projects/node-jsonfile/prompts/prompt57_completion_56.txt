  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match carriage returns instead of line feeds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n{2}/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match two line feeds instead of one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^\n]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any character that is not a line feed.

DONE.
