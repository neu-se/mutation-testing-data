  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, while `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Request timed out')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `reject` to reject the promise with a `TimeoutError`, while this code logs a message to the console and does not reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Request timed out')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `reject` to reject the promise with a `TimeoutError`, while this code throws a new error with the message "Request timed out".

DONE.
