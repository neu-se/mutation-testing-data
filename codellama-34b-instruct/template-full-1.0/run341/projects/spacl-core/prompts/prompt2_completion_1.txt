  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match!
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.match!` is a negation of `spec.match` and would cause the regex to match any string that is not matched by the original pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match(false)` is a function that always returns `false`, regardless of the input, which would cause the regex to never match anything.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match([0, spec.length])
```
This would result in different behavior because `match([0, spec.length])` is a function that matches the entire string at any position, regardless of the input, which would cause the regex to always match the entire input string.

DONE.
