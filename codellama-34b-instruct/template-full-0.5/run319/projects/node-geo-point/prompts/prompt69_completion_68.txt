  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + x
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the two arguments would produce a different result, which would affect the calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of the two arguments would produce a different result, which would affect the calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
