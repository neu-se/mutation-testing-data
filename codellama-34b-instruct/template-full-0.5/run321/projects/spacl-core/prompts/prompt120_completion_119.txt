  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx[0]` is the first element of the `ctx` array, while `ctx` is the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.length` is the number of elements in the `ctx` array, while `ctx` is the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx[ctx.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx[ctx.length - 1]` is the last element of the `ctx` array, while `ctx` is the entire array.

DONE.
