  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `end` variable is a boolean that indicates whether the source has ended normally or not. By replacing it with `null`, the code would always return `null` as the error, which could cause incorrect behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `end` variable is a boolean that indicates whether the source has ended normally or not. By replacing it with `undefined`, the code would always return `undefined` as the error, which could cause incorrect behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `end` variable is a boolean that indicates whether the source has ended normally or not. By replacing it with `true`, the code would always return `true` as the error, which could cause incorrect behavior in the application.
