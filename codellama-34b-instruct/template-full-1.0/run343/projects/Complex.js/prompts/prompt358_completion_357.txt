  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+1` operator would cause the final result to be off by one unit, potentially leading to incorrect results in downstream computations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-1` operator would cause the final result to be off by one unit in the opposite direction, potentially leading to incorrect results in downstream computations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*2` operator would cause the final result to be twice as large as it should be, potentially leading to incorrect results in downstream computations.

DONE.
