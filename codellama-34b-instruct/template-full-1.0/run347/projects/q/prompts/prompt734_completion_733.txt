  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment (`promises`) is used to resolve the deferred value, whereas an empty array (`[]`) is used in this option.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment (`promises`) is used to resolve the deferred value, whereas `null` is used in this option.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment (`promises`) is used to resolve the deferred value, whereas `promises.concat()` is used in this option.

DONE.
