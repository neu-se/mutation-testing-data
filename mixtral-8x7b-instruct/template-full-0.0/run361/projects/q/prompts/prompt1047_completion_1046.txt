 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `null` instead of throwing an error when the queue is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return an empty object instead of throwing an error when the queue is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return a resolved promise instead of throwing an error when the queue is closed.

DONE.
