  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(e)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would be called with the `e` exception, which would trigger an error handling routine that may have different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would be called with a new `Error` object, which would trigger an error handling routine that may have different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would be called with `null`, which would not trigger an error handling routine and may have different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
