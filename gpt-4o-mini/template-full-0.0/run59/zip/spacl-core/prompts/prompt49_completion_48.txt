Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value being pushed to the `props` array to an uppercase version of `part`, which would not match the expected format of the path specification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only takes the first character of `part`, which would not correctly capture the entire segment of the path specification, potentially leading to incorrect regex generation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the characters in `part`, which would not represent the original path segment correctly, leading to an invalid regex pattern.

DONE.
