  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is `false`. If `err` is `true`, the original code fragment would return `null, null`, while this new code fragment would return `err, null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is truthy. If `err` is `true`, the original code fragment would return `null, null`, while this new code fragment would return `null, null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? err : null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `err
