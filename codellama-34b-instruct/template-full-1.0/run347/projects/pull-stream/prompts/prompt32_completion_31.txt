  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.apply()` is not the same as `pull()`, as it would change the way the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.call()` is not the same as `pull()`, as it would change the way the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.bind()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.bind()` is not the same as `pull()`, as it would change the way the function is called.

DONE.
