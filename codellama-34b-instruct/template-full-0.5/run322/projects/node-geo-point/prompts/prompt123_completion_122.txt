  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `point` variable, which would change the result of the `calculateBearing` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the `point` variable, which would also change the result of the `calculateBearing` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the `point` variable, which would significantly change the result of the `calculateBearing` method.

DONE.
