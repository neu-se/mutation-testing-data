  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read === null
```
This change will cause the `nextChunk` function to be called even if `_read` is not null, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read !== null
```
This change will cause the `nextChunk` function to be called only if `_read` is not null, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read === undefined
```
This change will cause the `nextChunk` function to be called only if `_read` is undefined, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
