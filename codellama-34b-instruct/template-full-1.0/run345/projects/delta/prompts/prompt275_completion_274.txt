  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType` is a function that returns the type of the next op in the iterator, while `iter.peekType()` is a property that returns the data of the next op in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.nextType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.nextType` is a function that returns the type of the next op in the iterator, while `iter.nextType()` is a property that returns the data of the next op in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek` is a function that returns the current op in the iterator, while `iter.peek()` is a property that returns the data of the current op in the iterator.

DONE.
