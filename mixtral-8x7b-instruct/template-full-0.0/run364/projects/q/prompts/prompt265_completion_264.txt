 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function would be called with the `null` value instead of the original `value`. This could cause issues if the code downstream expects a non-null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current execution context, which is not necessarily the same as the `value` that was intended to be passed to `fulfill`. This could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the code downstream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Replacement error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would be called with an error object instead of `value`. This could cause the error handling code to be triggered, which may not be expected by the developers.

DONE.
