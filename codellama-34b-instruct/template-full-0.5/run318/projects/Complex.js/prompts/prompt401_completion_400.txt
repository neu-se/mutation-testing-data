  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less than or equal to operator (`<=`), while this new code fragment uses the less than operator (`<`). This means that the new code fragment will only evaluate to true if `res['im']` is strictly less than 0, while the original code fragment would evaluate to true if `res['im']` is less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less than or equal to operator (`<=`), while this new code fragment uses the greater than operator (`>`). This means that the new code fragment will only evaluate to true if `res['im']` is strictly greater than 0, while the original code fragment would evaluate to true if `res['im']` is less than or equal to 0.
