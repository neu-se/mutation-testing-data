  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method would be called instead of the `delete` method, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).concat
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would be called instead of the `delete` method, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would be called instead of the `delete` method, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
