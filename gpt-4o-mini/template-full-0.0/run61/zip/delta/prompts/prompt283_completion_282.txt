Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `insert` string instead of its index within the string, which could lead to incorrect calculations for the `start` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first character of the `insert` string instead of its index, which would not provide the intended position within the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.split('').reverse().join('').indexOf(newline)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would first reverse the `insert` string and then search for the index of `newline` in the reversed string, which is not the intended logic and could yield unexpected results.

DONE.
