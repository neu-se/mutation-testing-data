  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "post" method is replaced with "get" method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "post" method is replaced with "put" method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "post" method is replaced with "delete" method.

DONE.
