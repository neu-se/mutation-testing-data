  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.includes('http://localhost')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for the presence of a protocol, while this modification checks for the specific protocol "http://" and the exact string "localhost".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.subdomain.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for the presence of a subdomain, while this modification checks for the length of the subdomain to be greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.protocol == 'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not check for the protocol, while this modification specifically checks for the protocol "https:".

DONE.
