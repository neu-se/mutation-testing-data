  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function, and `null` is not a function, so the condition would always evaluate to `true` in the buggy code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function, and `undefined` is not a function, so the condition would always evaluate to `true` in the buggy code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function, and `undefined` is not a function, so the condition would always evaluate to `true` in the buggy code fragment.

DONE.
