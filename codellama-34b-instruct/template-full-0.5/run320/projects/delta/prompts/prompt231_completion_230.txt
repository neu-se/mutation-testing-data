  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to stop one element too early, potentially missing a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to start one element too late, potentially skipping a necessary operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to skip over a necessary operation, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
