  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.slice(1)` returns a new array with the same elements as `array`, but without the first element. This means that the `i` variable in the `return` statement would start at 1 instead of 0, and the `cb` function would be called with `null` and `array[0]` instead of `null` and `array[i++]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length - 1` returns the length of the `array` minus 1. This means that the `i` variable in the `return` statement would start at the length of the `array` minus 1 instead of 0, and the `cb` function would be called with `null` and `array[array.length - 1]` instead of `null` and `array[i++]`.
