  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `x` as the argument for `Math.abs()`, while the replaced code fragment uses `y`. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect results in the surrounding code.

DONE.
