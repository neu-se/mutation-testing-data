  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is a function that takes a promise and returns a callback, whereas `universalify.fromCallback` is a function that takes a callback and returns a promise. This would cause the `readFile` function to behave differently when it is called with a callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is a function that takes a promise and returns a callback, whereas `universalify.fromAsync` is a function that takes a promise and returns an async function. This would cause the `readFile` function to behave differently when it is called with an async function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is a function that takes a promise and
