  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because while the original code fragment calculates the bearing between two points, replacing `y` with `-y` would calculate the bearing in the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI - y
```
This would result in different behavior because while the original code fragment calculates the bearing between two points, replacing `y` with `Math.PI - y` would calculate the bearing between the two points in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.PI - y) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because while the original code fragment calculates the bearing between two points, replacing `y` with `(Math.PI - y) * 2` would calculate the bearing between the two points in the opposite direction and then multiply the resulting bearing by 2.

DONE.
