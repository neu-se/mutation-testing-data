  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the stack line is from Node.js.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeFrame()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the stack line is not from Node.js.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the stack line is not from the Q library.

DONE.
