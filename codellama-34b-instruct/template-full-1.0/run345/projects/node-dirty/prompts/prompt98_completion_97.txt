  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Could not load corrupted row: ' + rowStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only emits an error event if the row string is empty, while this modified code fragment always emits an error event when a corrupted row is encountered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Could not load corrupted row: ' + rowStr.trim())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only emits an error event if the row string is empty, while this modified code fragment always emits an error event when a corrupted row is encountered. Additionally, the modified code fragment trims whitespace from the beginning and end of the row string before emitting the error event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Could not load corrupted row: ' + rowStr.substring(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
