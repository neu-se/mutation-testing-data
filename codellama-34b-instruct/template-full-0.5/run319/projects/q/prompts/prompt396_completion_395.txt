  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to return `undefined` instead of the expected value, leading to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to return `null` instead of the expected value, leading to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to throw an error instead of returning the expected value, leading to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

DONE.
