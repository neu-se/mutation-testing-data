  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is using a different regular expression pattern, which may not match the same parts of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.+@([^ ]+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is using a different regular expression pattern, which may match different parts of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is using a different regular expression pattern, which may match different parts of the string.

DONE.
