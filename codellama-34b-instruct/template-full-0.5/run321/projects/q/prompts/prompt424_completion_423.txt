  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected` object would now be considered rejected, even if it was previously fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected` object would now be considered pending, even if it was previously fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected` object would now be considered not fulfilled, even if it was previously fulfilled.

DONE.
