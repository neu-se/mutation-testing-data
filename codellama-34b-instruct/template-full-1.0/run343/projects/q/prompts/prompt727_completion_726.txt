  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(--pendingCount === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will invert the boolean value of the expression, causing the `deferred.resolve` method to be called even if the `pendingCount` variable is not zero, which would cause the `any` method to return a resolved promise even if not all of the input promises are resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--pendingCount !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `--` operator will decrement the `pendingCount` variable by 1, which would cause the `any` method to never return a resolved promise if the `pendingCount` variable is initially zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator will check if the `pendingCount` variable is greater than zero, which would cause the `any` method to never return a resolved
