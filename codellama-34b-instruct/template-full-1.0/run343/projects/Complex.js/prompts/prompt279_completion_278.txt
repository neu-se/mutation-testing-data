  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the cosine function would be flipped, which could cause the function to return incorrect values in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the absolute value function would be used instead of the cosine function, which could change the results of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the cosine function with its inverse, which could cause the function to return incorrect values in certain cases.

DONE.
