  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fapply` function expects a function as its first argument, but `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fapply` function expects a function as its first argument, but `undefined` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fapply` function expects a function as its first argument, but `Q` is not a function.

DONE.
