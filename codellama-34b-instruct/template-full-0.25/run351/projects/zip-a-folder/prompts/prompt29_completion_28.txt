  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of the promise being resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method would be called on the `output` stream instead of the `close` event being emitted, which would cause the stream to be closed immediately instead of waiting for the archive to be finalized.

DONE.
