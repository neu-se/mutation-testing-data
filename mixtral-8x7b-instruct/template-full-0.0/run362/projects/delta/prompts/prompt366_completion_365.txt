 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'insert'.concat('X')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always check for a specific string 'insertX' instead of the `peekType()` method of the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType || 'insert'
