Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the expected object would lead to a runtime error when trying to call a method on `null`, whereas the original code expects a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would also cause a runtime error when attempting to access a method on `undefined`, differing from the original code which expects a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty object would not have the method specified by `name`, leading to a failure in the promise chain, unlike the original code which expects a valid object with the method.

DONE.
