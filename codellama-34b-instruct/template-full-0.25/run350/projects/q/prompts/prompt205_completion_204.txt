  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLine.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first word of the stack trace, rather than the entire line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLine.split(" ")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second word of the stack trace, rather than the entire line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLine.split(" ").length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the number of words in the stack trace, rather than the entire line.

DONE.
