  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise itself, while this code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the same value as the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return Q.resolve(value);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise itself, while this code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the same value as the original promise, but with a different promise ID.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return Q.reject(value);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise itself, while this code fragment returns a new promise that rejects with the same reason as the original promise.

DONE.
