  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `op`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `op` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `op` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `op` is `false`.

DONE.
