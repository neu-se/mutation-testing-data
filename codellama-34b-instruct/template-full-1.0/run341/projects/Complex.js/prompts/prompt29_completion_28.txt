  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is the second parameter passed to the `logHypot` function, while `a` is the first. Using `b` instead of `a` would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected results in the caller code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` and `b` before passing them to `Math.log`. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected results in the caller code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `b` from `a` before passing the result to `Math.log`. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected results in the caller code.

DONE.
