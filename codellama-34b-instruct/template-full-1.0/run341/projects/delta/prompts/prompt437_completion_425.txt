  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes.slice(offset, length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array of attributes that is a subset of the original `attributes` array, rather than the original array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes.concat([length])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new array of attributes that concatenates the original `attributes` array with an additional element that is the `length` of the current `nextOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes.filter(attr => attr >= length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would return a new array of attributes that only contains elements that are greater than or equal to the `length` of the current `nextOp`.

DONE.
