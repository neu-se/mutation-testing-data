  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER was originally a zero-width space character (`'\uFEFF'`) which is used to indicate the Byte Order Mark (BOM) in a UTF-8 file, and the replacement code fragment is a single space character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER was originally a zero-width space character (`'\uFEFF'`) which is used to indicate the Byte Order Mark (BOM) in a UTF-8 file, and the replacement code fragment is a carriage return character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\uFEFF'
```
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER was originally a zero-width space character (`'\uFEFF'`) which is used to indicate the Byte Order Mark (BOM) in a UTF-8 file, and the replacement code
