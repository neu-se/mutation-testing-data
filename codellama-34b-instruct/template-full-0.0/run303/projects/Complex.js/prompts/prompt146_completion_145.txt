  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `z` is zero, but the new code fragment is checking if `z` is a zero-length string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `z` is infinite, but the new code fragment is checking if `z` is a string that represents an infinite value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `z` is not a number, but the new code fragment is checking if `z` is a string that represents a NaN value.

DONE.
