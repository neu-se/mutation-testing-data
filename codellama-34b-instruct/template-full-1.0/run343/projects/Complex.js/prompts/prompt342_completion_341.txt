  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a`, which evaluates to a number, whereas the modified code fragment `a + 1` evaluates to a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a`, which has no relation to the variable `b`, whereas the modified code fragment `b` is a reference to the variable `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a`, which is a variable, whereas the modified code fragment `this['re']` is a property accessor expression that accesses the `re` property of the current object.

DONE.
