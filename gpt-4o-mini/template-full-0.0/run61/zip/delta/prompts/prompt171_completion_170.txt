Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Math.max` would return the larger of the two lengths instead of the smaller, potentially causing the `thisOp` and `otherOp` to be processed incorrectly, leading to unexpected results in the `Delta` composition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because summing the lengths would yield a value that is greater than either individual length, which could lead to an attempt to process more operations than available, resulting in errors or incorrect `Delta` outputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because using only the length of `otherOp` would ignore the length of `thisOp`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations when composing the two `Delta` instances, as it would not account for the current operation's length.

DONE.
