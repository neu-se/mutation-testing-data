  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing the number 1 as the second argument to the `Q.nfapply` function, which would cause the function to return a promise that resolves to the number 1 instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing the number 2 as the second argument to the `Q.nfapply` function, which would cause the function to return a promise that resolves to the number 2 instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing the number 3 as the second argument to the `Q.nfapply` function, which would cause the function to return a promise that resolves to the number 3 instead of the original value.

DONE.
