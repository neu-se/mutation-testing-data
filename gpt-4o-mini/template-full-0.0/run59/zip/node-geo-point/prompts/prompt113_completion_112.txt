Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly divides the latitude by 360 instead of 180, effectively halving the angle conversion from degrees to radians, which would lead to incorrect calculations in the `toTile` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it mistakenly uses the longitude instead of latitude for the conversion to radians, which would yield incorrect results in the `toTile` method, as the latitude is essential for the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies the sine function to the latitude before converting it to radians, which alters the intended calculation and could lead to incorrect results in the `toTile` method.

DONE.
