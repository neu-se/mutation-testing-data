  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash character is used to escape special characters in regular expressions, and the original code fragment is a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the forward slash character is used to indicate the start of a regular expression, and the original code fragment is a backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the asterisk character is used to indicate the start of a regular expression, and the original code fragment is a backslash.

DONE.
