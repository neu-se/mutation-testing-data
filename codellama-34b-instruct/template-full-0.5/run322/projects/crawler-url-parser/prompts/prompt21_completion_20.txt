  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would always use HTTPS instead of HTTP, which could cause issues with websites that don't support HTTPS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + window.location.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would use the current hostname instead of the hardcoded 'http://' string, which could cause issues if the hostname changes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://' + window.location.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would always use HTTPS and the current hostname, which could cause issues if the website doesn't support HTTPS or if the hostname changes.

DONE.
