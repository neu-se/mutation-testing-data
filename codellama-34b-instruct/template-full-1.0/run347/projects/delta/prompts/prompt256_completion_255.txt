  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.insert === typeof otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code compares the values of `thisOp.insert` and `otherOp.insert`, while this replacement code compares the types of those values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert != otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality between `thisOp.insert` and `otherOp.insert`, while this replacement code checks for inequality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert !== otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for deep equality between `thisOp.insert` and `otherOp.insert`, while this replacement code checks for strict inequality.

DONE.
