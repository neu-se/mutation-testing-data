  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` returns a shallow copy of the `args` array, whereas `args.concat()` returns a new array containing the elements of `args` and any additional elements passed as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the `args` array, whereas `args.concat()` simply concatenates the elements of `args` with any additional elements passed as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.filter(Boolean)` filters out any falsy values from the `args` array, whereas `args.concat()` simply concatenates all elements of `args` with any additional elements passed as arguments.

DONE.
