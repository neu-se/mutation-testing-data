  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch` is a method for scheduling a function to be called in the future, while `Q(object).then` is a method for registering a callback to be called when a promise is resolved or rejected. Using `Q(object).then` instead of `Q(object).dispatch` would cause the function to be called immediately, rather than being scheduled for later execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch` is a method for scheduling a function to be called in the future, while `Q(object).resolve` is a method for resolving a promise with a value that is immediately available. Using `Q(object).resolve` instead of `Q(object).dispatch` would cause the function to be called immediately, rather than being scheduled for later execution, and the promise would be resolved with the value that is immediately available, rather than being scheduled
