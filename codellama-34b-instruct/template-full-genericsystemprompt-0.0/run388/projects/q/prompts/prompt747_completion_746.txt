  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onProgress` callback to be called for each promise in the array, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected).then(onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onProgress` callback to be called only after all promises in the array have been fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected).then(onProgress).catch(onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onProgress` callback to be called only after all promises in the array have been fulfilled or rejected, and it would also catch any errors that occur during the execution of the
