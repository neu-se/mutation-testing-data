  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value of the second point instead of the first point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the longitude value of the first point, which would change the direction of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of pi instead of the longitude value of the first point, which would change the calculation completely.

DONE.
