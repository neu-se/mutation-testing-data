  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to set a new value for the key in the `_data` object, instead of reading the current value and using it to update the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use an empty string as the key for the update, instead of using the `key` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use `undefined` as the value for the key in the `_data` object, instead of using the current value.

DONE.
