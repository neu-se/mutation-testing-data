Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
srcFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the source file exists instead of the destination file, potentially allowing overwriting of existing files without throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destFile + '.tmp'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a temporary file instead of the actual destination file, potentially allowing the destination file to be overwritten without throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/dev/null'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always checks for the existence of a non-existent file (/dev/null is a special file that discards all data written to it, but in this context, it's used as a placeholder to illustrate the mutation), potentially allowing the function to proceed without checking for the actual destination file's existence.

DONE.
