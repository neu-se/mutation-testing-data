  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with any errors that are not handled by the promise chain, even if the error is not a rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () {}, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with any errors that are not handled by the promise chain, even if the error is not a rejection. Additionally, the `function () {}` callback would be called with the resolved value, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, function (error) {
    throw error;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be rethrown, which would cause the promise chain to be rejected with the error.

DONE.
