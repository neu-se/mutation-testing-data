  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if the complex number is infinite and the result is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while the new code fragment checks if the complex number is zero and the result is not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if the complex number is infinite and the result is not zero.

DONE.
