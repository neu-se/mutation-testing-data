  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(clothes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `games` and `clothes` arrays, resulting in a new array that contains all the elements of both arrays. In contrast, the original code fragment only concatenates the `games` array with the `clothes` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array that contains all the elements of the `games` array except for the last element. In contrast, the original code fragment concatenates the `games` array with the `clothes` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.filter(function(item) { return item !== 'games'; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array that contains all the elements of the `games` array that are
