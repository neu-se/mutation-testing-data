  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.bind(null)` is a bound function, which has a different `this` binding than the original function. As a result, the behavior of the function call would be affected by the new `this` binding, and the tests would likely fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.toString()` would return a string representation of the function, rather than invoking the function. As a result, the behavior of the function call would be changed, and the tests would likely fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.bind(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.bind(promise)` would bind the `promise` object as the `this` binding of the function, which would affect the behavior
