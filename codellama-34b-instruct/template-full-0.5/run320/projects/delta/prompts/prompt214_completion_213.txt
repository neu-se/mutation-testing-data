  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the second element of the `ops` array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0].retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the `retain` property of the first element of the `ops` array instead of the element itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the `insert` property of the first element of the `ops` array instead of the element itself.

DONE.
