  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = thisOp[action]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was missing the `const` keyword, and `embedType` was being reassigned multiple times in the same block of code, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using a different variable (`otherOp`) to access the `retain` property, and the `const` keyword was missing from the declaration of the `embedType` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = Delta.getHandler(thisOp[action])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not using the `getHandler` function to retrieve the embed type, and the `const` keyword was missing from the declaration of the `embedType` variable.

DONE.
