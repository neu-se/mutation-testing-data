  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.includes(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the callback is already in the list of callbacks, while the new code fragment checks if the callback is not in the list of callbacks. This change would cause the callback to be added to the list of callbacks even if it is already present, which could lead to duplicate callbacks being executed.
