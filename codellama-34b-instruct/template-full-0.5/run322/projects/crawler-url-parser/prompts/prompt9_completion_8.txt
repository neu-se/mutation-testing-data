  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase()` would convert the `baseUrlStr` to lowercase, which could potentially change the result of the `URL.parse()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(1)` would remove the first character of the `baseUrlStr`, which could potentially change the result of the `URL.parse()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split('').reverse().join('')` would reverse the order of the characters in the `baseUrlStr`, which could potentially change the result of the `URL.parse()` method.

DONE.
