 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'b' + Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the string 'b' with the first key of the object `b`, instead of just using the first key as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `null` instead of the first key of the object `b`, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number instead of the first key of the object `b`, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior in the calling code.

DONE.
