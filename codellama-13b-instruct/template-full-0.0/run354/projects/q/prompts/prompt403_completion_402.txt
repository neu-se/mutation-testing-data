  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the specified reason, rather than the original code fragment which would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason returned by the `Q.thenReject` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject(Q.reject(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason returned by the `Q.reject` function, rather than the original code fragment which would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason returned by the `Q.thenReject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject(Q.reject(Q.reject(reason)))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason returned by the `Q.reject`
