Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the line number to a string instead of a number, which could lead to type errors or unexpected behavior in subsequent calculations or comparisons that expect a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(attempt1[2])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the line number to an integer, potentially losing any decimal precision if the line number were to be a floating-point number, which is not typical for line numbers but could lead to inconsistencies in certain contexts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[2] * 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would coerce the line number to a number using multiplication, which could lead to unexpected results if `attempt1[2]` is not a valid numeric string, resulting in `NaN` instead of a valid line number.

DONE.
