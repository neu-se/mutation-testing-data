  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function immediately, while the new code fragment does not call the callback function at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('Test error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, while the new code fragment throws an error when the callback function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { this.emit('error', new Error('Test error')); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not emit an error event, while the new code fragment emits an error event when the callback function is called.

DONE.
