  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value of `this['re']` is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if the value of `this['isInfinite']()` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value of `z['re']` is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if the value of `z['isInfinite']()` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value of `this['re']` is zero, while the new code fragment checks if the value of `this['isZero']()` is true.

DONE.
