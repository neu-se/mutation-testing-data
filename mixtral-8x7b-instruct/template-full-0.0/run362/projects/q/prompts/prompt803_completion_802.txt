 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function is replaced with an empty function, which would not execute the provided callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would not be passed, and the progress notifications would not be handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'not a function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be replaced with a string, which would cause a `TypeError` when the engine attempts to call it.

DONE.
