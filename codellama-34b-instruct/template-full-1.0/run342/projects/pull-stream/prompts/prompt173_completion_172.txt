  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the value is an array, while `!Array.isArray` checks if the value is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` checks the length of the array, while `array.length === 0` checks if the array is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.filter(function (v) { return v !== undefined; }).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` would remove all elements that are undefined, and then the length property would return the number of remaining elements, which would be different from the original code.

DONE.
