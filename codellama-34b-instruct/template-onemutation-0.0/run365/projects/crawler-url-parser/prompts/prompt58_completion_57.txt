  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `parsedUrl.protocol` is `http:` or `https:`, but the mutated code fragment is checking if it is `false`. This would cause the code to behave differently for URLs with a protocol other than `http:` or `https:`.

DONE.
