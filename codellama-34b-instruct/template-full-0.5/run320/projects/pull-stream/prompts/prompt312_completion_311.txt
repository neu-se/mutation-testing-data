  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` only passes `ended` as an argument to the callback function, while this new code fragment passes both `null` and `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` passes `data` as an argument to the callback function, while this new code fragment passes `null` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` only passes `ended` as an argument to the callback function, while this new code fragment passes both `ended` and `data`.

DONE.
