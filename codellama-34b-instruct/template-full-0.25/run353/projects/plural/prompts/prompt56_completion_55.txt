  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a variable reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ves' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a concatenation of two string literals.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ves' + w.substr(0, w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a concatenation of a string literal and a substring of the `w` variable.

DONE.
