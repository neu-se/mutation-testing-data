  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return a function instead of calling the async method, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would call the async method with `this` as the context instead of no context, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would call the async method with `null` as the context instead of no context, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
