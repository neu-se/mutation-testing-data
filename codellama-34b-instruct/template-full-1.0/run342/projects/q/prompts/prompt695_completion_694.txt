  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function would be called with `this` set to `null`, which could lead to unexpected results if the function being bound relies on `this` or uses its own `this` internally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function would be called with `this` set to an empty object, which could lead to unexpected results if the function being bound expects a specific object to be `this` or uses its own `this` internally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function would be called with `this` set to a new promise returned by `Q.defer()`, which could lead to unexpected results if the function being bound expects a specific promise to be `this` or uses its own `this` internally.

DONE.
