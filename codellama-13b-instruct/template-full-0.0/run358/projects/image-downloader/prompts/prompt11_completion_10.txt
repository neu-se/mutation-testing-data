  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.dirname` function returns the directory name of a path, while the original code fragment `path.basename` returns the last component of a path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.extname` function returns the extension of a path, while the original code fragment `path.basename` returns the last component of a path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.join` function joins all given path segments together using the platform-specific separator as a delimiter, while the original code fragment `path.basename` returns the last component of a path.

DONE.
