  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `i` variable instead of incrementing it, leading to a different value being returned by the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next element in the array instead of the current element, leading to a different value being returned by the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the element at twice the index of the current element, leading to a different value being returned by the function.

DONE.
