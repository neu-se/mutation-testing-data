  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the longitude of the `point` object instead of the `point` object itself, which would cause the `calculateBearing` method to use the wrong values for the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point, this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `point` object as the first argument and `this` as the second argument, which would cause the `calculateBearing` method to use the wrong values for the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude, point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the longitude and latitude of the `point` object as separate arguments, which would cause the `calculateBearing` method to use the wrong values for the calculation.

DONE.
