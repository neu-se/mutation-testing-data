  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behaviors when it comes to handling `this` and arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will have its `this` set to the first argument, and its arguments set to the remaining arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` sets the `this` value of the function to the first argument, and the arguments to the remaining arguments. By passing `null` as the first argument, the `this` value of the function will be set to the global object, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
