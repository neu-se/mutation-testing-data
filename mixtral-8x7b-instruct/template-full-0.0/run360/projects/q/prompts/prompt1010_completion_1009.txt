 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes the `name` argument in the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause unexpected behavior in the called method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Array.prototype` instead of `[].slice`, which could cause issues if the `Array.prototype` has been modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.apply([], arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates all arguments into a single array, which could cause unexpected behavior if the method expects separate arguments.

DONE.
