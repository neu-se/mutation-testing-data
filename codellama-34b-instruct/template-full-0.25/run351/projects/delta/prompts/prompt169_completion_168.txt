  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to advance to the next element, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to advance to the next element in the other delta, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to stop immediately, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
