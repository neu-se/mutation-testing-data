  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` variable, which is assumed to be a non-null value. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to return a null value instead, which could break the functionality of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` variable, which is assumed to be a defined value. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to return an undefined value instead, which could break the functionality of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` variable, which is assumed to be a numerical value. Replacing it with `i` would cause the function to return a string value instead, which could break the functionality of the program.

DONE.
