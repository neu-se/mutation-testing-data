  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a node resolver function with the correct `this` context, whereas the modified code fragment creates a node resolver function with a `this` context of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a node resolver function with the correct `this` context, whereas the modified code fragment creates a node resolver function with a `this` context of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a node resolver function with the correct `this` context, whereas the modified code fragment creates a node resolver function with a `this` context of `deferred`.

DONE.
