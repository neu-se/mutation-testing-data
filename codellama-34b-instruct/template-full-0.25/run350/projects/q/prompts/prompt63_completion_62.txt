  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so `setImmediate.bind(undefined)` would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a function that can be called later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so `setImmediate.bind(null)` would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a function that can be called later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a function, so `setImmediate.bind(0)` would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a function that can be called later.

DONE.
