  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value when `a` or `b` is zero, rather than only when both are zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value when `a` is zero and `b` is not zero, rather than only when both are zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value when `b` is zero and `a` is not zero, rather than only when both are zero.

DONE.
