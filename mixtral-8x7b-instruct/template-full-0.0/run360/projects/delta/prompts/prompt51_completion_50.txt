 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'b'.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string 'String' instead of the actual keys of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['key1', 'key2'].includes(embedType) ? 'key1' : 'key2'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return either 'key1' or 'key2' based on the length of the array, not the actual keys of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.ownKeys(a)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first own property key of the object 'a', not necessarily the key of the common embed type.

DONE.
