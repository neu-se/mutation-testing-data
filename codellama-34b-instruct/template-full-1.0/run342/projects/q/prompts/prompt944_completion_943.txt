  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the first argument to `defer`, which would cause `defer` to throw an error when it tries to call `deferred.reject` with an undefined reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to `defer`, which would cause `deferred.reject` to be called without a reason, resulting in an unhelpful `Promise rejected` message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `false` as the first argument to `defer`, which would cause `deferred.reject` to be called with a reason of `false`, resulting in a less informative error message.

DONE.
