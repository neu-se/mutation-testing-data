  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `err && abort` is a different condition than `err || abort`. In the original code, if `err` is truthy, the function aborts and calls `cb` with `err`. In the mutated code, if `err` is falsy, the function aborts and calls `cb` with `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? abort : cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `err ? abort : cb` is a different condition than `err || abort`. In the original code, if `err` is truthy, the function aborts and calls `cb` with `err`. In the mutated code, if `err` is truthy, the function aborts and calls `cb` with `abort`. If `err` is falsy, the function calls `cb` with `cb`.
