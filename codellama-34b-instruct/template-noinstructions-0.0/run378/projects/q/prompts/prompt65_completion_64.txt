  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `flush` is a function that is called to flush the queue, while the new code fragment `throw new Error("Test error")` will throw an error instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Test log")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `flush` is a function that is called to flush the queue, while the new code fragment `console.log("Test log")` will log a message to the console instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `flush` is a function that is called to flush the queue, while the new code fragment `return` will return from the function without flushing the queue.

DONE.
