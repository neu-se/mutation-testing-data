  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments the `offset` variable by the length of the current operation, while this code increments it by 1 regardless of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code updates the `index` variable based on the current operation, while this code resets it to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `length` variable to determine the number of operations to iterate over, while this code sets it to 0, causing the loop to exit immediately.

DONE.
