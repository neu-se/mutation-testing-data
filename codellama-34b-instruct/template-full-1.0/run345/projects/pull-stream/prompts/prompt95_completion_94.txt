  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the callback function passed to `drain` returns `false` if `test(data)` is truthy, but if `data` is null, then `test(data)` would also be null, and the callback function would not return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the callback function passed to `drain` returns `false` if `test(data)` is truthy, but if the callback function is an empty function, then it would not return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the callback function passed to `drain` returns `false` if `test(data)` is truthy, but if `test(data)` is 0, then the callback function would not return `false`.

DONE
