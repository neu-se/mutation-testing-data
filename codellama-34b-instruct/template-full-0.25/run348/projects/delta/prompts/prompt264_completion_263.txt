  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the attributes of the two ops, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the inserted text of the two ops, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the retained text of the two ops, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
