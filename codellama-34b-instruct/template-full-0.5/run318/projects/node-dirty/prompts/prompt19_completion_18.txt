  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` variable is not defined. The code would throw a `ReferenceError` when attempting to access the `push` method of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method creates a shallow copy of the `cbs` array, which means that the original array would not be modified when the `push` method is called on the copy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method creates a new array that is the result of merging the `cbs` array with an empty array. This means that the original `cbs` array would not be modified when the `push` method is called on the new array.

DONE.
