  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` would remove the key from the map, whereas `set` would update the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value associated with the key to be one greater than the original value, whereas the original code would simply set the value to the new value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value associated with the key to be twice the original value, whereas the original code would simply set the value to the new value.

DONE.
