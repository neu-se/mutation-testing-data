  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of the `other` variable, which is an instance of the `Delta` class. In the original code, `thisIter.peekLength()` is called to get the length of the current operation in the `this` variable, not `other`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.length` is the length of the `this` variable, not the `other` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.length` is the length of the `thisIter` iterator, not the `other` variable.

DONE.
