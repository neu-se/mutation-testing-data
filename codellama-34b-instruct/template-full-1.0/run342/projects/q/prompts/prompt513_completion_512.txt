  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys()` function would be called with `undefined` as its argument, which would likely throw a `TypeError` and cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys()` function would be called with `null` as its argument, which would likely throw a `TypeError` and cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys()` function would be called with an empty array as its argument, which would result in the returned value being an empty array, which would likely cause the test to fail if it was expecting a non-empty array.

DONE.
