 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Buggy replacement'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the spawn function would reject the promise instead of executing the generator function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy replacement') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the spawn function would throw an error instead of executing the generator function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve('Buggy replacement')
```
This would result in different behavior because the spawn function would immediately resolve the promise with the string 'Buggy replacement' instead of executing the generator function.

DONE.
