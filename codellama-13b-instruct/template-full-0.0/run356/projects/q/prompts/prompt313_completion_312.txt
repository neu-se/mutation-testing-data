  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the same value as the original promise, rather than the result of the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the result of the `race` method, which is a promise that resolves with the first of an array of promises to become settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the result of the `all` method, which is a promise that resolves with an array of the results of the input promises.

DONE.
