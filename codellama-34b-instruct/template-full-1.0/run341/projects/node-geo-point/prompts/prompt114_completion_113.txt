  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin()` function returns the sine of an angle, whereas `cos()` returns the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/Math.cos()
```
This would result in different behavior because dividing by the cosine of an angle will give a different result than dividing by the sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asin()` function returns the arcsine of a value, whereas `acos()` returns the arccosine.

DONE.
