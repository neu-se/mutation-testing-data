  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im']` is the imaginary part of the complex number, while `this['re']` is the real part. Using `this['im']` instead would return the imaginary part instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re'] + this['im']` would return the sum of the real and imaginary parts, while `this['re']` returns the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im'] - this['re']` would return the difference of the imaginary and real parts, while `this['re']` returns the real part.

DONE.
