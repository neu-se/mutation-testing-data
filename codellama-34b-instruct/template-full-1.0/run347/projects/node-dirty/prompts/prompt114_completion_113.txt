  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'error'` is a valid event name, but it is not the event that is emitted when the file is loaded successfully. The event `'load'` is used to indicate that the file has been loaded successfully. Replacing `'load'` with `'error'` would cause the test suite to fail to detect when the file has been loaded successfully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'invalid'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'invalid'` is not a valid event name. The test suite would not detect this error, and the code would continue to execute as if the file had been loaded successfully, even though it may not have been.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid event name. The test suite would not detect this error, and the code would continue to execute as if the file had been loaded successfully, even though it may not have
