  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `latitude` property of the `object` variable, which may not be the same as the value of the `latitude` parameter passed to the `fromObject` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[latitude]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `latitude` property of the `object` variable, which may not be the same as the value of the `latitude` parameter passed to the `fromObject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `longitude` property of the `object` variable, which may not be the same as the value of the `longitude` parameter passed to the `fromObject` method.

DONE.
