  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would be called with an `undefined` argument, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would be called with a `null` argument, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would be called with an empty object, which would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
