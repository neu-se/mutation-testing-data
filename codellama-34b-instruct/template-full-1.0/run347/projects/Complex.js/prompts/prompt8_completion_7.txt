  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (x - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
causes a divide-by-zero error for x = 1, while the replacement code fragment
would not cause an error for x = 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
causes a divide-by-zero error for x = -1, while the replacement code fragment
would not cause an error for x = -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
would cause an infinite loop for x = 0, while the replacement code fragment
would not cause an infinite loop for x = 0.

DONE.
