  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `fapply` is a method that applies the promise's value to a function and returns a new promise for the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the result of the callback function, whereas `fapply` is a method that applies the promise's value to a function and returns a new promise for the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is a method that dispatches an event to the promise's event listeners, whereas `fapply` is a method that applies the promise's value to a function and returns a new promise for the result.

DONE.
