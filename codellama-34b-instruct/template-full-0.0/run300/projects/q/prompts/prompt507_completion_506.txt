  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array that is the result of concatenating the `args` array with the `value` argument, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.map(function(arg) { return arg + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array that is the result of applying the provided function to each element of the `args` array, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the `post` method.

DONE.
