  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset > index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'insert' and the offset is less than the index or priority is false, while this new code fragment checks if the next type is 'insert' and the offset is greater than the index or priority is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset !== index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'insert' and the offset is less than the index or priority is false, while this new code fragment checks if the next type is 'insert' and the offset is not equal to the index or priority is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset <= index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if
