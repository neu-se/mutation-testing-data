  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because `offset % 60` gives the remainder of `offset` divided by 60, which will be a number between 0 and 59. The original code `offset / 60` would give the number of hours in the offset, which could be a non-integer value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor(offset)` gives the largest integer less than or equal to `offset`, whereas the original code `offset / 60` gives the number of hours in the offset, which could be a non-integer value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil(offset)` gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to `offset`, whereas the original code `offset / 60` gives the number of
