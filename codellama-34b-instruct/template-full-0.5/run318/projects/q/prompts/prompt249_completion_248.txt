  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` is used to search for a specific substring within the stack trace, while `length` would return the total number of characters in the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n").length
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is used to split the stack trace into an array of lines, while `length` would return the total number of lines in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is used to extract a portion of the stack trace starting from the second character, while `indexOf` would return the position of the first occurrence of the substring within the stack trace.

DONE.
