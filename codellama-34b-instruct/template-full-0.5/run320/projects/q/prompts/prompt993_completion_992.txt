  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this code fragment creates a new deferred object with a null value. This could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code, depending on how the deferred object is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this code fragment creates a new deferred object with an undefined value. This could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code, depending on how the deferred object is used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this code fragment creates a new deferred object with the value 1. This could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code, depending on how the deferred object is used.

DONE.
