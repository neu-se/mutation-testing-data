  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would cause the order of the lines in the stack trace to be reversed, which could make it more difficult to identify the source of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.slice(1).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first element of the `desiredLines` array, which could cause the stack trace to be incomplete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.concat(["extra line"]).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method would add an extra line to the `desiredLines` array, which could cause the stack trace to be longer than expected.

DONE.
