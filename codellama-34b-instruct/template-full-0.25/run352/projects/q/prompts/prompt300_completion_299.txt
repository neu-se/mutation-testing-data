  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([this, that])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the input array have resolved, whereas `Q([this, that])` returns a promise that resolves when any of the promises in the input array have resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race([this, that])

This would result in different behavior because `Q.race` returns a promise that resolves when any of the promises in the input array have resolved, whereas `Q([this, that])` returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the input array have resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.any([this, that])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.any` returns a promise that resolves when any of the promises in the input array have resolved, whereas `Q([this, that])` returns a promise that resol
