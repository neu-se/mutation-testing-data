  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the array, which may not be intended in the context of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.splice(0, 1)` would remove the first element of the array, which may not be intended in the context of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })` would return a new array with each element incremented by 1, which may not be intended in the context of the code.

DONE.
