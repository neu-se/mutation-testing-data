  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code uses a different case for the replacement string, which could cause issues in certain cases where the string is used in a case-sensitive context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex.replace('ves', 'zes')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code uses a different replacement string, which could cause issues in certain cases where the string is used in a context where the replacement is expected to be a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex.replace(/ves$/, 'zes')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code uses a different regular expression for the replacement, which could cause issues in certain cases where the regular expression is expected to match a specific pattern.

DONE.
