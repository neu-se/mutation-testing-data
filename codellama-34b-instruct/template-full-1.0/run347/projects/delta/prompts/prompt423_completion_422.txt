  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2

```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the `length` variable, which would make the whole calculating algorithm that uses the `length` variable behave differently.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + offset

```
This would result in different behavior because it wouldn't take into account the difference between the `index` and the `offset` variable.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(length, index - offset)

```
This would result in different behavior because it would ensure the difference between the `length` and the `index - offset` is not less than zero.

My three answers are different because each has different behavior in the code. DONE
