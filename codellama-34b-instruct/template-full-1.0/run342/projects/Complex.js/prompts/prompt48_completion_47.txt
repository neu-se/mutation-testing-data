  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a['abs']) || Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks that `a['abs']` is not finite and `a['arg']` is finite, but the new code fragment checks that `a['abs']` is finite or `a['arg']` is finite, which is a different condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite(a['abs'] || a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks that `a['abs']` is not finite and `a['arg']` is finite, but the new code fragment checks that neither `a['abs']` nor `a['arg']` is finite, which is a different condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a['abs'] * a['arg'])
```
This would result in different
