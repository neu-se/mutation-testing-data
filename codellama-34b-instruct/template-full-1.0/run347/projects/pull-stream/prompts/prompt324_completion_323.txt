  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the strict equality operator (`===`), while this replacement uses the ternary operator to return `null` if `abort` is truthy, and `abort` itself if it's falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy using the `===` operator, while this replacement checks if it's falsy using the `===` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof abort === 'boolean' ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment doesn't check the type of `abort`, while this replacement checks if it's a boolean using the `typeof` operator. If `abort` is not a boolean, the replacement would return `abort
