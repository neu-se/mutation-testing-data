  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
require("q")
```
This would result in different behavior because the program would now require the module "q" to be installed, which is not the original intention of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the program would now return undefined instead of a rejected promise with the error message "Expected q but got undefined"

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"q"
```
This would result in different behavior because the program would now return the string "q" instead of a rejected promise with the error message "Expected q but got undefined".

DONE.
