  Sure, I can help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[1]` refers to the second argument passed to the `invoke` method, while `arguments` alone refers to the `arguments` object, which is the array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(1)` extracts a subset of the `arguments` object starting from the second argument, while `arguments` alone refers to the entire `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.length - 1` refers to the index of the last argument passed to the `invoke` method, while `arguments` alone refers to the entire `arguments` object.
