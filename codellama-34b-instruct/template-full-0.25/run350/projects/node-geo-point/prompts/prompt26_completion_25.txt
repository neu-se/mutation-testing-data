  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, so the code would not compile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, so the code would not compile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, so the code would not compile.

DONE.
