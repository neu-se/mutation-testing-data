  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve the value associated with the `key` property of the `this._data` object, rather than the `key` parameter passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve the value associated with the `key` property of the `this._data` object, but with the string `'foo'` appended to the end of the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key, 'bar')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve the value associated with the `key` property of the `this._data` object, but with the string `'bar'` passed as a second argument to the `get` method.

DONE.
