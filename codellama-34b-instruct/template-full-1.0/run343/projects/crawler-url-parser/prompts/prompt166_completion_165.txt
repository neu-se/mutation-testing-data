  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(part_count_diff) == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the absolute value of the difference between the two paths, allowing the function to recognize differences in path length regardless of the direction of the difference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would detect if there are more than one level difference between the two paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would detect if there are more than one level difference between the two paths or if the paths are on the same level.
