  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `getEmbedTypeAndData` throws an error if `embedType` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = 'secret'
```
This would result in different behavior because `getEmbedTypeAndData` can't find a handler for an embed type of `'secret'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = 'image'
```
This would result in different behavior because `getEmbedTypeAndData` would return a different value for the embed data than the original code.

DONE.
