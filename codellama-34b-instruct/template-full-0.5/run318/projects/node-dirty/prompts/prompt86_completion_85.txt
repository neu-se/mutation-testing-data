  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the data into rows using the newline character, while the new code fragment splits the data into rows using the tab character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the data into rows using the newline character, while the new code fragment splits the data into rows using an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the data into rows using the newline character, while the new code fragment splits the data into rows using a space character.

DONE.
