  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude would be calculated using the starting point's latitude instead of the destination point's latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the destination point's latitude would be increased by 1 degree, which would change the direction of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the destination point's latitude would be doubled, which would change the direction of the bearing and the distance.

DONE.
