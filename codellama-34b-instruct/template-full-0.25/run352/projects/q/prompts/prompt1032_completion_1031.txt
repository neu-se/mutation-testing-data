  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the error to the nodeback, while this replacement passes the error as the first argument and null as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(null, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the error to the nodeback, while this replacement passes null as the first argument and the error as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the error to the nodeback, while this replacement passes the error as both arguments.

DONE.
