  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'
```
This would result in an incorrect plural form because the code would return the same string instead of adding an "s" to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celli'
```
This would result in an incorrect plural form because the code would return a different string instead of adding an "s" to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celloes'
```
This would result in an incorrect plural form because the code would add an extra "s" to the end of the string.

DONE.
