  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `resolver` is not a function, while this code fragment checks if `resolver` is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `resolver` is not a function, while this code fragment checks if `resolver` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolver !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `resolver` is not a function, while this code fragment checks if `resolver` is not an object.

DONE.
