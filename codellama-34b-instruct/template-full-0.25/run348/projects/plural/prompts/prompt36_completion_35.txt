  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would return a different result, as the starting index is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would return a different result, as the ending index is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would return a different result, as the starting and ending indices are different.

DONE.
