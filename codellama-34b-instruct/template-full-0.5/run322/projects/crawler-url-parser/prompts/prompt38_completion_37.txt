  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument would cause the `auth` property of the `URL` object to be excluded from the parsing process, which could result in different behavior if the URL contains authentication information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument would cause the `hash` property of the `URL` object to be excluded from the parsing process, which could result in different behavior if the URL contains a fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` arguments would cause the `auth` and `hash` properties of the `URL` object to be included in the parsing process, which could result in different behavior if the URL contains authentication information or a fragment
