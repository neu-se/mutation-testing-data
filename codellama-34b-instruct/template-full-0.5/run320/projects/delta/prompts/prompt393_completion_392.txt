  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.next(length)` returns the next `length` operations in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(length + 1)` would return the next `length + 1` operations in the iterator, which is not the same as `otherIter.next(length)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(length - 1)` would return the next `length - 1` operations in the iterator, which is not the same as `otherIter.next(length)`.

DONE.
