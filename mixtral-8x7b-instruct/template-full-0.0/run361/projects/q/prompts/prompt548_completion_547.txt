 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Buggy error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Error object with a specific message, instead of using the original exception object, which might contain valuable information about the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the exception object with a null value, which might not be handled correctly by the calling code, leading to unexpected behavior or application crashes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
