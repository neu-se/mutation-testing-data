  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" Bakery"
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a local variable that is an object with an `insert` property, whereas the replacement `" Bakery"` is a string and does not have an `insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a local variable that is an object with an `insert` property, whereas the replacement `10` is a number and does not have an `insert` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a local variable that is an object with an `insert` property, whereas the replacement `null` is `null` and does not have an `insert` property.

DONE.
