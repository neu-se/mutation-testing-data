  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext(null)` would always return `false`, causing the `if` statement to never be executed, and the `else` block to always be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext(undefined)` would always return `false`, causing the `if` statement to never be executed, and the `else` block to always be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext(Infinity)` would always return `true`, causing the `if` statement to always be executed, and the `else` block to never be executed.

DONE.
