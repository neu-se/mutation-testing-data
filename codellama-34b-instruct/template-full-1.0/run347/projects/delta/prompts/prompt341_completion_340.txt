  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not call the `next` method on the iterator, which is necessary to retrieve the next operation in the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peek
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not consume the next operation in the slice, and would instead return the next operation without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first operation in the slice, rather than the next operation as intended.

DONE.
