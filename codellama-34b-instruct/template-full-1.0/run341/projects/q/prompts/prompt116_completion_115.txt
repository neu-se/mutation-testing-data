  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method will always return 0, even if the item being searched for is not in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method will always return the length of the array, regardless of whether the item being searched for is in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method will always return `null`, which may not be the correct index for the item being searched for.

DONE.
