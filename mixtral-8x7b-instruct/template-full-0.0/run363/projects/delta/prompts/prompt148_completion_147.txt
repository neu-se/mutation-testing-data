 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always takes the next 1-length operation from `thisIter`, instead of using the length provided by the `end` variable. This could lead to skipping or including extra operations in the resulting `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next(<number>firstOther.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `retain` value of the first operation in `otherIter` instead of the `length` of the next operation in `thisIter`. This could lead to skipping or including extra operations in the resulting `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next(Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), firstOther.retain))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `retain` value of the first operation in `other
