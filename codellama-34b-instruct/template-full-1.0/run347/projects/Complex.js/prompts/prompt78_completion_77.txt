  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < b
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of less than (<) instead of less than or equal to (<=) means that if the array contains negative numbers, the loop will not stop at the first positive number, but will continue until all negative numbers are processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will now only process the array elements at indexes greater than 0, skipping the first array element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i] == ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will now only process array elements that are equal to the character ' ', skipping all other types of array elements.

DONE.
