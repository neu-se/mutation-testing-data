 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.delete !== undefined || typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it now checks if `op.delete` is not undefined instead of checking if it exists. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `op.delete` is explicitly set to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.hasOwnProperty('delete') || typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it now checks if the `op` object has a property called 'delete' instead of checking if the property exists. This change would cause the code to behave differently when other properties with the name 'delete' are present in the `op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'delete' in op || typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it now checks if the 'delete' property is present
