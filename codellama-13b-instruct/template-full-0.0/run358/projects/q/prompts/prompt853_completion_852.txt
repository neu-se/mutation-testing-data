  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `clearTimeout` to cancel a timeout, while `setTimeout` would create a new timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `clearTimeout` to cancel a timeout, while `clearInterval` would cancel a repeating interval.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearImmediate
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `clearTimeout` to cancel a timeout, while `clearImmediate` would cancel an immediate timeout.

DONE.
