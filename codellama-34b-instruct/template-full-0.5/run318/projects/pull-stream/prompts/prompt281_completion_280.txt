  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the `mapper` function, which would cause the `map` function to always return the `id` function, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `mapper` function, which would cause the `map` function to always return a different function than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `mapper` function to a different context, which would cause the `map` function to always return a different function than the original code.

DONE.
