  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearterValue
```
This would result in different behavior because "nearter" is not a valid function in JavaScript, and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferredPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because "deferredPromise" is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is not a function, it's an object that contains the promise methods, providing a different behavior than the original `nearerValue`.

DONE.
