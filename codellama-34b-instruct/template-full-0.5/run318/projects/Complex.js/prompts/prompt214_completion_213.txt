  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.exp` function to be called with the value of `a` instead of `b`, which could potentially lead to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.exp` function to be called with the sum of `a` and `b` instead of just `b`, which could potentially lead to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.exp` function to be called with the product of `a` and `b` instead of just `b`, which could potentially lead to a different result.

DONE.
