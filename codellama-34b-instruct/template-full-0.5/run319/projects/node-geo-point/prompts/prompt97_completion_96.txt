  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is a different variable than `y`, and it may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because negating `y` would give a different result than using `y` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `y` would give a different result than using `y` directly.

DONE.
