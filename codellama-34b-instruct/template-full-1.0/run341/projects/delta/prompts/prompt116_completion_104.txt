  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
item => item
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the reduce function to skip over every other item in the array, resulting in incorrect output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
item => item + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the reduce function to produce incorrect output by always adding 1 to the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
item => item * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the reduce function to produce incorrect output by always multiplying the result by 2.

DONE.
