 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number is not being used in the calculation, causing incorrect results for complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number is being replaced with the real part, causing incorrect results for complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() * places
```
This would result in different behavior because a random value is being used instead of the imaginary part of the complex number, causing unpredictable results.

DONE.
