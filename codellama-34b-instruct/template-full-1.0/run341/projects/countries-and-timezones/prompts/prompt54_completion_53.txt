  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(timezones)
```
This would result in a type error because `timezones` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones)
```
This would result in a different output because `data.timezones` is an array, not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(data.timezones)
```
This would result in a different output because `Object.values` returns an array of values, not an array of keys.

DONE.
