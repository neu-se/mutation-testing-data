  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether 'a' is <= 0, but the new code would always be false since 0 is not less or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether 'a' is <= 0, but the new code would always be true since Math.sqrt(0) is 0, which is less than or equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.MAX_VALUE
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether 'a' is <= 0, but the new code would always be false since Number.MAX_VALUE is a very large number and is not less than or equal to 0.

DONE.
