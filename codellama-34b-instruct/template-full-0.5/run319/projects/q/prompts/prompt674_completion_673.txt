  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that rejects the promise, whereas `dispatch` is a method that dispatches the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a method that notifies the promise of progress, whereas `dispatch` is a method that dispatches the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method that resolves the promise, whereas `dispatch` is a method that dispatches the promise.

DONE.
