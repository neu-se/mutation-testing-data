  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof thisOp.retain` returns the type of `thisOp.retain`, which is always `'object'`, while `typeof thisOp.retain === 'number'` returns a boolean indicating whether the type of `thisOp.retain` is a number or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain.some()
```
This would result in different behavior because `some()` is a method that checks if a value is present in an array, and since `thisOp.retain` is an object, `some()` will always return `undefined`, which is falsy. `typeof thisOp.retain === 'number'` would return `false` if `thisOp.retain` is an object, and `true` if it's a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain.length
```
This would result in
