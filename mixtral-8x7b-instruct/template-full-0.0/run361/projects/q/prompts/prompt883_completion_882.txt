 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the success callback would be called instead of the failure callback when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be replaced with an empty function, which would not propagate the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise.resolve` is not a function, and attempting to call it would throw an exception.

DONE.
