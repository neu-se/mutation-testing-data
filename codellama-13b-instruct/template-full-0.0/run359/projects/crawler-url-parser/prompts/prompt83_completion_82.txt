  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.href
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the current element in the iteration, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `href` attribute of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` variable is not defined in the current scope, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `href` attribute of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `$(this)` selector refers to the current element in the iteration, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `href` attribute of the current element.

DONE.
