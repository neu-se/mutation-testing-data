Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because the semicolon will not match any line breaks, causing the entire buffer to be treated as a single line, which may lead to incorrect parsing of the JSON data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because using a carriage return followed by a newline may not match the line endings used in the stored data, potentially causing the data to be read incorrectly or not at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the pipe character is not a valid line separator for the JSON data, leading to the entire buffer being processed as a single entry, which would disrupt the expected key-value pair extraction.

DONE.
