  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {return null};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the array of arguments passed to the `nbind` method, while this code fragment returns a function that always returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {throw new Error("Placeholder function called");};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the array of arguments passed to the `nbind` method, while this code fragment returns a function that throws an error when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the array of arguments passed to the `nbind` method, while this code fragment returns an empty array.

DONE.
