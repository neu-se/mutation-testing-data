  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.any
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.any` would return a promise that is fulfilled when any of the promises in the array are fulfilled, whereas `this.all` would return a promise that is fulfilled when all of the promises in the array are fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.none
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.none` would return a promise that is fulfilled when none of the promises in the array are fulfilled, whereas `this.all` would return a promise that is fulfilled when all of the promises in the array are fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.race` would return a promise that is fulfilled when any of the promises in the array are fulfilled, whereas `this.all` would return a promise that is fulfilled when all of the promises in the array are fulfilled
