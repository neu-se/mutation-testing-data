  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a value that is one greater than the original `read` value, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a value that is one less than the original `read` value, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a value that is twice the original `read` value, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
