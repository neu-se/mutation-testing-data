  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap.set` method would not be called, and the `currentUrl` object would not be added to the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap.set` method would be called with `undefined` as the value, which would overwrite any existing value in the map with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap.set` method would be called with an empty object as the value, which would overwrite any existing value in the map with an empty object.

DONE.
