  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_defineProperty(promise, "__minimumStackCounter__", {value: p.stackCounter, configurable: true});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object is modified, instead of the `error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, "__minimumStackCounter__", {value: p.stackCounter + 1, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackCounter` property value is modified to be one greater than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, "__minimumStackCounter__", {value: null, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackCounter` property value is being set to `null`, instead of a number.

DONE.
