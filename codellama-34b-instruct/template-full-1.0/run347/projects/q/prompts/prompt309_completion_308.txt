  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(Error('rejected'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code in the `promise()` function is `deferred.reject(exception)`, which will reject the promise with the `exception` object as the reason. However, the modified code will always reject the promise with a fixed error message, regardless of the actual reason for the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code in the `promise()` function is `reject(Error('rejected'))`, which will reject the promise with an error object as the reason. However, the modified code will always return a resolved promise, regardless of the actual reason for the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw Error('rejected')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code in the `promise()` function is `reject(Exception('rejected'))`,
