  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the callback function passed as an argument, while the new code fragment does not. This would cause the test suite to fail to catch errors that occur during the `update` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the callback function passed as an argument, while the new code fragment does not. This would cause the test suite to fail to catch errors that occur during the `update` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the callback function passed as an argument, while the new code fragment calls an empty function instead. This would cause the test suite to fail to catch errors that occur during the `update` method.

DONE.
