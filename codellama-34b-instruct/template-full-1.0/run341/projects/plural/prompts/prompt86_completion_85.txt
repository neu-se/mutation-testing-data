  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `addRule('person', 'peoples')`. This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural form of "person" to be "peoples" instead of "people", which is the correct plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `addRule('person', function(w) { return w + 'es'; })`. This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural form of "person" to be "people" instead of "people", which is the correct plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `addRule('person', undefined)`. This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural form of "person" to be undefined, which would likely result in errors in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
