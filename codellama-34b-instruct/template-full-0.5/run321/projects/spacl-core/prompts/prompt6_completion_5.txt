  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an empty path to match, which is not allowed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for any character to be matched, including characters that are not allowed in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!\/)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for a path that does not start with a slash to match, which is not allowed in the original code.

DONE.
