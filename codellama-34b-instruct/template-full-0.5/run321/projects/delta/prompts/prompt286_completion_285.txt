  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `start` would be incremented by 1, which could affect the outcome of the `indexOf` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` would be used as the starting position for the `indexOf` method, which could return a different index if the newline character is present at a different position in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `length - 1` would be used as the starting position for the `indexOf` method, which could return a different index if the newline character is present at a different position in the string.

DONE.
