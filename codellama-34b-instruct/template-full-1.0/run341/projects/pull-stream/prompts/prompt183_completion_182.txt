  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional becomes always true, causing the function to infinitely recurse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional becomes always false, causing the function to never enter the `else` branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional checks if the length of the array is 0, but the code assumes that the length of the array is greater than 0.

DONE.
