  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number, while the original code returns a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.toFixed(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `toFixed` returns a string representation of the number with a fixed number of digits after the decimal point, while the original code returns a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.toExponential()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toExponential` returns a string representation of the number in exponential notation, while the original code returns a complex number.

DONE.
