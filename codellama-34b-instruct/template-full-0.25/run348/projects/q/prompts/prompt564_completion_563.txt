  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value or another promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause an error to be thrown, which would be caught by the `catch` block and result in the promise being rejected with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would return a rejected promise with the error message "error".

DONE.
