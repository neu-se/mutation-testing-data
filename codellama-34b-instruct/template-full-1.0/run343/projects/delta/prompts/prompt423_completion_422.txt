  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `index` to `length`, instead of subtracting `offset` from `index`. As a result, the resulting `index` value would be different in certain cases, and could potentially cause the `transformPosition` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `length` from `offset`, instead of adding `index` to `length`. This would also cause the resulting `index` value to be different in certain cases, and could potentially cause the `transformPosition` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `length` from `index` and then subtract `offset` from the result, instead of subtracting `offset` from `index` and then adding `length` to the result.
