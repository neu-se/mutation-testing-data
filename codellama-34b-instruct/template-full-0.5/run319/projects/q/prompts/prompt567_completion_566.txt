  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to return a promise for `undefined` instead of the result of `result.value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to return a promise for `null` instead of the result of `result.value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to return a rejected promise with the error "foo" instead of the result of `result.value`.

DONE.
