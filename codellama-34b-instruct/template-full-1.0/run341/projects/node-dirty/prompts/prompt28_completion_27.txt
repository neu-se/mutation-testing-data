  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because a "close" event would be emitted instead of a "drain" event, which could cause the test suite to pass even if the code is not functioning correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because an "error" event would be emitted instead of a "drain" event, which could cause the test suite to fail even if the code is functioning correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because a "data" event would be emitted instead of a "drain" event, which could cause the test suite to fail even if the code is functioning correctly.

DONE.
