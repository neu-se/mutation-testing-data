 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tools.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array, while `concat` returns a new array without modifying the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tools.join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `join` concatenates all elements of the array into a string, while `concat` is used to merge two or more arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tools.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from the array and returns that element, while `concat` is used to merge two or more arrays.

DONE.
