  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null`, which is a falsy value, while `undefined` is a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null`, which is a falsy value, while `0` is a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null`, which is a falsy value, while `''` is a truthy value.

DONE.
