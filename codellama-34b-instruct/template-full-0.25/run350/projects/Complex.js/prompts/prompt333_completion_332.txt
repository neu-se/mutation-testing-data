Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value for the same input.

DONE.
