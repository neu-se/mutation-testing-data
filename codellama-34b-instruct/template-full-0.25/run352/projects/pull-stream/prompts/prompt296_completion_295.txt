  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a lower precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(ended || !end) && !end`, which would always be true if `ended` is true, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `ended && (end || !end)`, which would always be true if `ended` is true and `end` is false, regardless of the value of `!end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(!ended && end) || !end`, which would
