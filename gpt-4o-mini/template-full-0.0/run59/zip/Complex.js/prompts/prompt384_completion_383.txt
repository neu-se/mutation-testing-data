Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the imaginary part being used in the calculation, potentially leading to incorrect results in the complex function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the real part `a` instead of the imaginary part `b`, which alters the intended calculation of the complex function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the value of `b`, which could significantly affect the output of the complex function, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
