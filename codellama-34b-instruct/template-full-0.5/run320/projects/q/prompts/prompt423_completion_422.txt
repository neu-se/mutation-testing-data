  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` is a method that checks if a promise is fulfilled, whereas `inspect` is a method that returns information about the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` is a method that checks if a promise is rejected, whereas `inspect` is a method that returns information about the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that allows you to specify callbacks for when a promise is fulfilled or rejected, whereas `inspect` is a method that returns information about the promise's state.

DONE.
