  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `self.reject(error)` is inside a `try...catch` block, which would catch any errors thrown by `self.reject(error)` and prevent the promise from being rejected. In contrast, the new code fragment `deferred.reject(error)` is not inside a `try...catch` block, so any errors thrown by `deferred.reject(error)` would not be caught and the promise would be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error(error));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `self.reject(error)` creates a new `Error` object with the `error` message, while the new code fragment `deferred.reject(new Error(error))` creates a new `Error` object with the `error` message and passes it to `deferred.reject()`.

Option 3: The PL
