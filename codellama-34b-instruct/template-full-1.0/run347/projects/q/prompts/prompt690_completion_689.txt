  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because "this" refers to the object on which the method was called, and it would change the first element of the argument list that is passed to the "apply" method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the first element of the argument list that is passed to the "apply" method to "undefined".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[promise, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the first element of the argument list that is passed to the "apply" method to the "promise" object.

DONE.
