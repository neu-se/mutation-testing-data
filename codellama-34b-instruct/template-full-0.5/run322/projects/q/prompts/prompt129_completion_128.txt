  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the index of the current iteration into the `keys` array, instead of the value of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[index]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of the current element into the `keys` array, instead of the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[index] + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of the current element plus one into the `keys` array, instead of the index.

DONE.
