  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This code fragment will pipe the `stream` to the standard output, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stderr)
```
This code fragment will pipe the `stream` to the standard error, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(null)
```
This code fragment will pipe the `stream` to `null`, which will cause the stream to be closed and no data will be written to it.

DONE.
