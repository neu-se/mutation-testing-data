  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next` method on the `this` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next element in the `ops` array, rather than the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous element in the `ops` array, rather than the current element.

DONE.
