  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the other operation, rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the current operation, rather than the length of the other operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp) + Op.length(otherOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the sum of the lengths of the current and other operations, rather than the length of the current operation.

DONE.
