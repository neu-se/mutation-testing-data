  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code fragment, which would return `read` without modifying it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a negative value of `read` than the original code fragment, which would return a positive value of `read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read ** 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the square of `read` than the original code fragment, which would return `read` unchanged.

DONE.
