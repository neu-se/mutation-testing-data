  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` is a function that takes two arguments and returns the first argument raised to the power of the second argument, whereas `Math.sqrt` is a function that takes one argument and returns its square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` is a function that takes one argument and returns its cube root, whereas `Math.sqrt` is a function that takes one argument and returns its square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` is a function that takes one argument and returns its natural logarithm, whereas `Math.sqrt` is a function that takes one argument and returns its square root.

DONE.
