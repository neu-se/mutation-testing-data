  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `this['isInfinite']`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the original code would have evaluated to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isFinite']` would check if the value is finite, whereas the original code checks if the value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isNaN']` would check if the value is NaN (Not a Number), whereas the original code checks if the value is infinite.

DONE.
