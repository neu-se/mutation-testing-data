  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` expects a positive number and returns `NaN` for negative numbers, whereas `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 / Math.log` is the multiplicative inverse of `Math.log`, and would return a different value for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` returns the base 10 logarithm of a number, which is different from the natural logarithm returned by `Math.log`.

DONE.
