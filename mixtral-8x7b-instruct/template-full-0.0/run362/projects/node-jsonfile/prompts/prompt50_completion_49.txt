 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment writes the string to the file and returns undefined, while this change would return the number of bytes written.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.appendFileSync(file, str, options)
