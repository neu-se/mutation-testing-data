 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...cbs.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the key-value pairs of the `cbs` object, instead of just the values. This could cause issues if the order of the keys is important or if there are keys with non-function values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always take the last callback from the `cbs` array, instead of the current one. This could cause issues if the order of the callbacks is important or if there are other parts of the code that rely on the original order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always take the first callback from the `cbs` array, instead of the current one. This could cause issues if the order of the callbacks is important or if there are other parts of the code
