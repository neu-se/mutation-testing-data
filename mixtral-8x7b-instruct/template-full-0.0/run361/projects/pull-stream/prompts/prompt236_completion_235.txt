 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` parameter in the callback function would be explicitly set to `null`, which might not be handled correctly by the calling code. The original code fragment uses the `end` parameter from the outer scope, which is passed to the inner function by the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` parameter in the callback function would be explicitly set to `false`, which might not be handled correctly by the calling code. The original code fragment uses the `end` parameter from the outer scope, which is passed to the inner function by the `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` parameter would be overwritten with the `data` value, which might cause unexpected behavior in the calling code. The original code fragment uses the `end` parameter from the outer
