  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(θ)` returns the sine of `θ`, which is not the correct value for the calculation of bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(θ)` returns the cosine of `θ`, which is not the correct value for the calculation of bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(y, x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2(y, x)` returns the arc tangent of `y` and `x`, which is not the correct value for the calculation of bearing.

DONE.
