  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `undefined` is a primitive value that is not equal to any string, including an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `match.length` is the length of the string. If the string is empty, `match.length` would be 0, which is not equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.indexOf('') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `match.indexOf('')` returns the index of the first occurrence of the empty string in `match`. If `match` is an empty string, `match.indexOf('')` would return 0, which is not equal to `null`.

DONE.
