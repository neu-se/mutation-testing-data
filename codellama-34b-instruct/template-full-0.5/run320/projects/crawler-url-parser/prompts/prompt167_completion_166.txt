  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` would check if `pageurl_path` starts with `linkurl_path`, whereas `includes` checks if `pageurl_path` contains `linkurl_path` as a substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `linkurl_path` contains `pageurl_path` as a substring, rather than checking if `pageurl_path` contains `linkurl_path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` would check if `linkurl_path` starts with `pageurl_path`, whereas `includes` checks if `linkurl_path` contains `pageurl_path` as
