Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(",")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delimiter from `=` to `,`, which would incorrectly count the number of query parameters, leading to an inaccurate `querycount`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(";")
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `;` as the delimiter instead of `=`, which would not correctly parse the query string and would likely result in a `querycount` of 0 for most URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(" ").length
```
This would result in different behavior because it counts the number of spaces in the query string instead of the number of parameters, which would not reflect the actual number of query parameters and could lead to misleading results.

DONE.
