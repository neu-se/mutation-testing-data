  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that handles rejected promises, while `_progressed` is a function that handles progress notifications. Using `_rejected` instead of `_progressed` would cause the promise to be rejected instead of being notified of progress.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that handles fulfilled promises, while `_progressed` is a function that handles progress notifications. Using `_fulfilled` instead of `_progressed` would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of being notified of progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return value + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function would increment the value of the promise, while the original function would not.

DONE.
