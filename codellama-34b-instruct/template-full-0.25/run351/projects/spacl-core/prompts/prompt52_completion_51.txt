  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an empty string onto the `parts` array, which would cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push `undefined` onto the `parts` array, which would cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push `null` onto the `parts` array, which would cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression.

DONE.
