  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the resolver function immediately, instead of passing it as an argument to `deferred.reject()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolver;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the truthiness of the `resolver` function, instead of calling it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.call(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resolver` function with the global object (`window`) as its `this` context, instead of passing it as an argument to `deferred.reject()`.

DONE.
