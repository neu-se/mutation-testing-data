  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `spec` string contains two consecutive forward slashes, while this replacement checks if it does not contain two consecutive forward slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\/*/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `spec` string contains two consecutive forward slashes, while this replacement checks if it contains two or more consecutive forward slashes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\/+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `spec` string contains two consecutive forward slashes, while this replacement checks if it contains one or more consecutive forward slashes.

DONE.
