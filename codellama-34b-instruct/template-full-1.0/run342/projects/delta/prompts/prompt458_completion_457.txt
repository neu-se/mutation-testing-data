  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method would always return `true`, even if the iterator has reached the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method would return a negative value, which is not possible in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType()` method would return `NaN`, which is not a valid return value in the original code.

DONE.
