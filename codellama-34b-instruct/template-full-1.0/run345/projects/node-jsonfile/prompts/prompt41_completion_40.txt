  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the async version of the `writeFile` function, which returns a promise that resolves when the file is written, whereas the sync version of the function returns nothing. Replacing the async function with the sync version would cause the function to always return undefined, which could break the code that relies on the return value of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
writeFileAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the sync version of the `writeFile` function, which blocks execution until the file is written, whereas the async version of the function returns a promise that resolves when the file is written. Replacing the sync function with the async version would cause the function to return a promise that may not be resolved or rejected, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
writeFileCallback
```
This would result in different
