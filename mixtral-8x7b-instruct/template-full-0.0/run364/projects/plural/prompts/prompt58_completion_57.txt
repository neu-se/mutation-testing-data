 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule will be added to the end of the `rules` array instead of the beginning, potentially changing the order in which rules are applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules = rules.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array and does not modify the original `rules` array, so the global `rules` variable would not be updated with the new rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function addRule(match, result) {
  rules.shift(); // remove the first rule
  rules.unshift([match, result]); // add the new rule to the beginning
  return plural;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the first rule in the `rules` array is removed every time a new rule is added, potentially changing the behavior of the `plural` function.
