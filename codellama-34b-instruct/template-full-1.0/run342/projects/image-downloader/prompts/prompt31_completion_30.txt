  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (res.statusCode !== 400) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise
with an error even if the status code is not 400, while the original code
only rejects the promise if the status code is not 200.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (res.statusCode !== 200 && res.statusCode !== 400) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise
with an error if the status code is not 200 or 400, while the original code
only rejects the promise if the status code is not 200.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (req.method !== 'GET') {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise
if the request method is not GET, while the original code only accepts GET
requests.
