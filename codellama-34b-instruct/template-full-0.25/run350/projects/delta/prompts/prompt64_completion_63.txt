  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to be called twice, which would result in the `newOp` being added to the `ops` array twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to be called with a different argument, which would result in a different operation being performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to be called with a different argument, which would result in a different operation being performed.

DONE.
