  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()) {
+ if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite and `z` is zero, while the modified code checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite and `z` is zero. This change would cause the method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` in the original code, but return `Complex['NAN']` in the modified code.
