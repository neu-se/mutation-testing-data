  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with `null` instead of the expected return value, which could cause issues in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(error, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with `error` instead of resolving with the expected return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with `null` twice, which could cause issues in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
