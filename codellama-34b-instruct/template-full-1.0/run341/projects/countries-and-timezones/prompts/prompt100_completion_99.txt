  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of values from the `tzs` object, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because `tzs.timezones` is a function, and `Object.keys()` expects an object as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs.countries
```
This would result in different behavior because `tzs.countries` is an array of currency objects, while `Object.keys()` expects an object as its argument.

DONE.
