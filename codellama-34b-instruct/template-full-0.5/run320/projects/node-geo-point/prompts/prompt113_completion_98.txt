  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 170
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant 170 is different from 180, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude is being used instead of the latitude, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant 1 is being added to the result of the calculation, which would cause the final result to be different.

DONE.
