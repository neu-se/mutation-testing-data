```
"stackTrace"
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"message"
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is different.

DONE.
