  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, and `read + 1` is a number. In the original code, the function `read` is called with the argument `ref[0]`, but in the mutated code, the number `read + 1` is used instead. This could cause the function to behave differently, potentially leading to a different output or error.
