  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with a buggy code fragment like:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event would no longer be emitted when the file stream is closed, which may cause issues for code that relies on this event being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event would be emitted when reading data from the file stream, which may cause issues for code that relies on the `error` event being suppressed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` event would be emitted when reading data from the file stream, which may cause issues for code that relies on the `data` event being suppressed.

DONE.
