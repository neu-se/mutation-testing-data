  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be called on the wrong object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.makeNodeResolver
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be called on the wrong object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be called on the wrong object.

DONE.
