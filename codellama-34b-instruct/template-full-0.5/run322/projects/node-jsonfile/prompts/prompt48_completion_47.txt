  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeFileSync` function expects a string as its third argument, but `null` is not a string. The function would throw an error if it receives `null` instead of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeFileSync` function expects a string as its third argument, but `undefined` is not a string. The function would throw an error if it receives `undefined` instead of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeFileSync` function expects a string as its third argument, but `{}` is an empty object, which is not a string. The function would throw an error if it receives an empty object instead of a string.

DONE.
