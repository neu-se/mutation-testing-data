  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const adjust = (input: number) => parseFloat(input.toFixed(precision)) + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the output of `adjust()`, which would cause the `latitude` and `longitude` values to be off by 1 in the resulting `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const adjust = (input: number) => parseFloat(input.toFixed(precision)) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the output of `adjust()` by 2, which would cause the `latitude` and `longitude` values to be twice as large as they should be in the resulting `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const adjust = (input: number) => parseFloat(input.toFixed(precision)) / 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because
