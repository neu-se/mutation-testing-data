  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[PLACEHOLDER]: (tzName, options) => getTimezone(id, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return a timezone with the id `id` instead of the id `tzName`, which could cause issues when trying to get the country for a timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[PLACEHOLDER]: (tzName, options) => getTimezone(options.tzName, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return a timezone with the id `options.tzName` instead of the id `tzName`, which could cause issues when trying to get the country for a timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[PLACEHOLDER]: (tzName, options) => tzName[options.tzName]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return a timezone with the name `options.tzName` instead of
