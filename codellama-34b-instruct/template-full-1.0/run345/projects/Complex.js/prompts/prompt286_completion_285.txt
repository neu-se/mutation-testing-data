  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the cosine of the complex number using the formula `cos(a) cosh(b) - i sin(a) sinh(b)`. Replacing the placeholder with `-b` would cause the code to calculate the cosine of the complex number using the formula `cos(a) cosh(-b) - i sin(a) sinh(-b)`, which is a different formula and would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the cosine of the complex number using the formula `cos(a) cosh(b) - i sin(a) sinh(b)`. Replacing the placeholder with `b-a` would cause the code to calculate the cosine of the complex number using the formula `cos(a) cosh(b-a) - i sin(a) sinh(b-a)`, which is a different
