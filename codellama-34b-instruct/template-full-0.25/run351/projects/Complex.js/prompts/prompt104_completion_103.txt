  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, which would be a NaN (Not a Number) value, instead of the expected complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, which would be an Infinity value, instead of the expected complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, which would be a zero value, instead of the expected complex number.

DONE.
