  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function that is called with the `abort` and `cb` arguments, while `null` is not a function and would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function that is called with the `abort` and `cb` arguments, while `undefined` is not a function and would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function that is called with the `abort` and `cb` arguments, while `() => {}` is a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing.

DONE.
