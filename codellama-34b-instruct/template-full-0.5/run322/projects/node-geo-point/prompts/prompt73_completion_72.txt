  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the distance by 2, which would cause the destination point to be half the distance away from the original point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the distance, which would cause the destination point to be twice as far away from the original point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the distance, which would cause the destination point to be 1 meter closer to the original point.

DONE.
