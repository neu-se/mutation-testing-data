  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit()` function would be called with an argument of 1, which would cause it to exit the program with a non-zero status code, indicating an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex['NAN']` value would be returned, indicating that the result of the calculation is not a number, which could cause errors in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex['INFINITY']` value would be returned, indicating that the result of the calculation is infinite, which could cause errors in the surrounding code.

DONE.
