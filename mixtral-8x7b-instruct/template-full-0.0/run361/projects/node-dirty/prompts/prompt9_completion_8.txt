 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val, key
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value would be assigned to the wrong variables, potentially causing issues when trying to store or retrieve data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.set(key, 'invalid_value')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a string value instead of the provided `val` variable, which could cause issues when trying to read the stored data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.set(key, val + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the value by 1 before storing it, which could cause issues when trying to read the stored data, especially if the stored data is not a number.

DONE.
