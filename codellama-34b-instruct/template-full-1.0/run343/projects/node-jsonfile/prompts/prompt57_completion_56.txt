  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\n/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex literal now contains an escaped backslash, which would not match a newline character in the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\\n]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the character class now matches a backslash followed by a newline character, which would not match the same newline character in the input string as the original regex would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^\n]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the character class now matches any character except newline, which would not match the same newline character in the input string as the original regex would.

DONE.
