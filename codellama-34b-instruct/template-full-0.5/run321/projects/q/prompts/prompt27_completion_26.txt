  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `domain` variable to be interpreted as a number, rather than an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"domain"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `domain` variable to be interpreted as a string, rather than an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `domain` variable to be interpreted as a null value, rather than an object.

DONE.
