  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.when
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved or rejected based on the outcome of the `when` method instead of being rejected.

DONE.
