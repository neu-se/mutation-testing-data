  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the real part of the complex number, while this code fragment uses the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the real part of the complex number, while this code fragment uses a different real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 -2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the real part of the complex number, while this code fragment uses the negative of the real part.

DONE.
