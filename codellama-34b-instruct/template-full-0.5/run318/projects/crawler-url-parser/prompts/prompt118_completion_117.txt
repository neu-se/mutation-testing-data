  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function expects a `currentUrl` object with a `subdomain` property, but `null` does not have this property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function expects a `currentUrl` object with a `subdomain` property, but `{}` does not have this property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ subdomain: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function expects a `currentUrl` object with a `subdomain` property that is a string, but `null` is not a string.

DONE.
