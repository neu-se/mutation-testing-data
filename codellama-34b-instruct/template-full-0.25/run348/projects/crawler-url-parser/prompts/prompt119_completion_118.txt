  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the protocol of the base URL, which may not be the same as the protocol of the current URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the host of the base URL, which may not be the same as the host of the current URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the pathname of the base URL, which may not be the same as the pathname of the current URL.

DONE.
