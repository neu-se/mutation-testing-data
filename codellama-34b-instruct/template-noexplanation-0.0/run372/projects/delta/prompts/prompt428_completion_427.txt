  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This code fragment checks if the `retain` property of the `op` object is not null, which is the opposite of the original code fragment. This change will cause the `length` function to return a different value than it would have with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This code fragment checks if the `retain` property of the `op` object is null, which is the opposite of the original code fragment. This change will cause the `length` function to return a different value than it would have with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== undefined
```
This code fragment checks if the `retain` property of the `op` object is not undefined, which is the opposite of the original code fragment. This change will cause the `length` function to return a different value than it would have with the original code fragment.
