  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This change will cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return the next `opLength + 1` elements from the `other` Delta, rather than just `opLength` elements. This could potentially cause the `diff()` method to produce incorrect results, as it is relying on the `otherIter.next()` method to return the correct number of elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This change will cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return the next `opLength - 1` elements from the `other` Delta, rather than just `opLength` elements. This could potentially cause the `diff()` method to produce incorrect results, as it is relying on the `otherIter.next()` method to return the correct number of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength *
