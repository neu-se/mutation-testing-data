  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the `ref` array is being used instead of the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `ref` array is being incremented by 1 instead of being used as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the `ref` array is being multiplied by 2 instead of being used as is.

DONE.
