  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice(1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the first element removed, so the loop would skip the first policy in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.filter(p => p.name !== 'admin')) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array with only the policies that match the filter condition, so the loop would skip any policies with the name 'admin'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.map(p => p.name)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method returns a new array with the result of calling the provided function on each element, so the loop would iterate over the names of the policies instead of the policies themselves.

DONE.
