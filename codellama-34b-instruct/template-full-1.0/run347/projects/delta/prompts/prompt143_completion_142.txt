  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` returns a boolean indicating whether there is another op available, whereas `peekLength` returns the length of the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` returns a boolean indicating whether there is another op available, whereas `peekLength` returns the length of the current op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(0, thisIter.peekLength - firstLeft)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the current op, and `firstLeft` is the number of characters left to iterate in the current op. Subtracting `firstLeft` from `peekLength` would ensure that the operation would only iterate up to the end of the current op, and not past it.

DONE.
