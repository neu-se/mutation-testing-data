  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, {fragment: true})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fragment` option would cause the URL to be formatted with a fragment identifier, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, {pathname: 'foo'})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pathname` option would cause the URL to be formatted with a different pathname, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, {search: 'foo'})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` option would cause the URL to be formatted with a different search query, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
