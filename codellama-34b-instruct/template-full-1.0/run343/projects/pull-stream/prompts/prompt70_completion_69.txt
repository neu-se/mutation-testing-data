  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && true === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `op` is not null and `data` is false, whereas the original fragment would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false == op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when `op` is not null and `data` is true, whereas the original fragment would return `true` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && op(data) == false || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when `op` is not null and `data` is not equal to `false`, whereas the original fragment would return `true` in that case.

DONE.
