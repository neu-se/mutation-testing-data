  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedBaseUrl` and `parsedUrl` variables are not defined in the current scope, and therefore cannot be used in the `URL.resolve()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method returns a parsed URL object, which is then used as the base URL for the `URL.resolve()` method. This would result in a different URL being resolved, which could potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used as the base URL for the `URL.resolve()` method, which could potentially cause the test to fail if the `baseUrlStr` variable is not defined or is not a valid URL.

DONE.
