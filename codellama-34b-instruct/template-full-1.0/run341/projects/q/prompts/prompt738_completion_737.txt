  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q.resolve` returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `Q.resolve` returns a promise that is fulfilled with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, and would likely cause an error if used as a replacement for `Q.resolve`.

DONE.
