  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console instead of flushing the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of flushing the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exit the function early instead of flushing the queue.

DONE.
