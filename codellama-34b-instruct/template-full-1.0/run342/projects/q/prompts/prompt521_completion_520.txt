  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise immediately, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that would immediately reject the promise with the given `reason`, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the given `reason` only when the `when` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject(reason)` would create a new promise that is rejected with the given `reason`, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the given `reason` only when the `when` method is called.

DONE.
