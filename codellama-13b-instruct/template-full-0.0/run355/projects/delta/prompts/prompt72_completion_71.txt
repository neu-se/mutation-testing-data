  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1].attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `attributes` property of the previous operation, rather than the `attributes` property of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `insert` property of the previous operation, rather than the `insert` property of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1].retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `retain` property of the previous operation, rather than the `retain` property of the current operation.

DONE.
