  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined, while the new code fragment checks if it is not undefined. This change would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the property is not undefined, but has a different value than the one expected.

DONE.
