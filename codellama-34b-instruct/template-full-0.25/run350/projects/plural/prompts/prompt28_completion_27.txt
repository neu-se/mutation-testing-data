  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment subtracts 1. This would cause the pluralization of words that end in "nucleus" to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment does not subtract anything. This would cause the pluralization of words that end in "nucleus" to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment adds 1. This would cause the pluralization of words that end in "nucleus" to be incorrect.

DONE.
