  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(new Error('Invalid Param'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error with a different message than the original code, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(new Error('Invalid Param'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error with a different message than the original code, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(new Error('Invalid Param'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error with a different message than the original code, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
