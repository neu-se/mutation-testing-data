  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred` variable to be passed as the first argument to `defer`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred` variable to be passed as the first argument to `defer`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred` variable to be passed as the second argument to `defer`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
