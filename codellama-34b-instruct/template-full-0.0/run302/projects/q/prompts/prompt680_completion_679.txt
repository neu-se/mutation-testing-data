  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` is now `2`, which would skip the first argument and return an array of all arguments except the first two.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` is now `0`, which would return an array of all arguments except the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` is now `2`, which would return an array of all arguments except the first two.

DONE.
