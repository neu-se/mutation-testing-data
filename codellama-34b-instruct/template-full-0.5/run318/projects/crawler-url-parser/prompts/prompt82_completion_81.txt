  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be selecting the `href` attribute of the `$(this)` element, which is not the same as the `href` attribute of the `a` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('src')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be selecting the `src` attribute of the `$(this)` element, which is not the same as the `href` attribute of the `a` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'newHref')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be setting the `href` attribute of the `$(this)` element to a new value, which would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
