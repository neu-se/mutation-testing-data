  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr = new Error('no done callback supplied')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `doneLackingErr` variable is now being assigned a new `Error` object, which would cause the `sink` function to throw an error if the `done` callback is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `doneLackingErr` variable is now being assigned `null`, which would cause the `sink` function to not throw an error if the `done` callback is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `doneLackingErr` variable is now being assigned `undefined`, which would cause the `sink` function to not throw an error if the `done` callback is not provided.

DONE.
