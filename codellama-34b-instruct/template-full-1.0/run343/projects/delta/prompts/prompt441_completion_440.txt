  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(offset+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring starting from the offset character would be returned, whereas the original code starts from the offset character itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(offset, length+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring starting from the offset character and with a length of length+1 would be returned, whereas the original code starts from the offset character and with a length of length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(offset, length) + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring starting from the offset character and with a length of length would be returned followed by the string 'a', whereas the original code returns just the substring.

DONE.
