 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the exception value would not be passed to the error handler, potentially causing the error to go unnoticed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the error handler would receive a boolean value instead of the actual exception, potentially causing confusion and incorrect error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the entire exception object would be passed to the error handler instead of just the exception value, potentially causing issues if the error handler is not designed to handle the entire object.

DONE.
