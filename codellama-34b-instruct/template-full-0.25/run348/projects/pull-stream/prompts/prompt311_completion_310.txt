  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the `data` variable, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `data` is falsy, and `false` when `data` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `data`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `data` is 0 or less, and `false` when `data` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the value of `data`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `data` is 1 or greater, and `false` when `
