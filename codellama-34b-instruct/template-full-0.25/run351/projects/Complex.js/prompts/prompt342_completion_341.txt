  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `a`, and the function is expected to use the value of `a` in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is expected to use the value of `a` as is, and adding 1 to it would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is expected to use the value of `a` as is, and multiplying it by 2 would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
