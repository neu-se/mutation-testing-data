  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the logical NOT operator `!` to check if `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` is falsy, while this replacement uses the logical OR operator `||` to check if `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the logical NOT operator `!` to check if `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` is falsy, while this replacement uses the logical AND operator `&&` to check if `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` is truthy and `targetFilePath` is also truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream !== targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the
