```
array_slice(arguments, <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of the <PLACEHOLDER constant would result in the function receiving an invalid second argument, which could cause an error or affect the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice function would return an empty array, instead of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice function would return an array with the last argument, instead of the original array.

DONE.
