  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` replaces all occurrences of the search string, whereas `replace` only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/\\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\\n/g` matches all occurrences of the newline character, whereas `replace` only matches the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/\\n/g, EOL) + EOF
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\\n/g` matches all occurrences of the newline character, whereas `replace` only matches the first occurrence. Additionally, the `EOF` variable is not defined in the original code, so this replacement would result in a reference error.

DONE.
