  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + '2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an element with the class "base", while the modified code fragment is looking for an element with the class "base2".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an element with the class "base", while the modified code fragment is looking for an element with the class "base ".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + '!'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an element with the class "base", while the modified code fragment is looking for an element with the class "base!".

DONE.
