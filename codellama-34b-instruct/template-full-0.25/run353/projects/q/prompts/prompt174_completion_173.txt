  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number would be incremented by 1, which could cause the code to access the wrong line in the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number would be decremented by 1, which could cause the code to access the wrong line in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the code to access the wrong line in the stack trace.

DONE.
