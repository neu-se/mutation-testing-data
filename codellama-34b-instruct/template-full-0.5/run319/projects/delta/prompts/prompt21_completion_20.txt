  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` checks for strict inequality, which means it will return `true` even if the values are of different types. In contrast, `!isEqual(a[key], b[key])` checks for deep equality, which means it will return `true` only if the values are of the same type and have the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key] && typeof a[key] === typeof b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for both strict inequality and type equality. This means it will return `true` only if the values are of the same type and have different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) || typeof a[key] !== typeof b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for either
