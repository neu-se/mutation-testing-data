  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to use the `otherData` object instead of `thisData`, which could lead to unexpected results if the two objects have different structures or properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to use the `embedType` property of the `thisData` object instead of the `otherData` object, which could lead to unexpected results if the two objects have different structures or properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to use the `embedType` property of the `otherData` object instead of the `thisData` object, which could lead to unexpected results if the two objects have different structures or properties.

DONE.
