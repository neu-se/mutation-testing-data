  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with two copies of the `key` variable as the second argument to `dispatch`, instead of passing a single `key` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to `dispatch`, instead of passing the `key` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the second argument to `dispatch`, instead of passing the `key` variable.

DONE.
