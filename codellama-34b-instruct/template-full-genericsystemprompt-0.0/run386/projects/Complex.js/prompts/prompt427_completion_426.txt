  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing by zero, which would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing by a negative number, which would cause the result to be negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing by infinity, which would cause the result to be NaN.

DONE.
