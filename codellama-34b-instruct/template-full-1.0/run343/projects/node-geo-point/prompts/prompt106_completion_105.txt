  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc ^ 2 ^ 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code `Math.pow` would raise a number to the power of 2, while the given code fragment `Math.trunc ^ 2 ^ 2` would first truncate the number to an integer, and then raise the truncated value to the power of 2, which would result in a different outcome for non-integer values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow ^ 2 ^ 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code `Math.pow` would raise a number to the power of 2, while the given code fragment `Math.pow ^ 2 ^ 2` would first raise the number to the power of 2, and then raise the result to the power of 2, which would result in a different outcome for non-integer values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round * Math.round
