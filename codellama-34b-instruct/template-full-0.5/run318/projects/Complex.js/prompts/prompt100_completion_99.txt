  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign is always positive, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `c` is multiplied by 2, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is used instead of `c`, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
