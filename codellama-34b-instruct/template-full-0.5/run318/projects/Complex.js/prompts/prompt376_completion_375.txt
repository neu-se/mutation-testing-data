  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to always return a complex number with a real part of 0, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to always return a complex number with a real part of 0, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to always return a complex number with a real part of 0, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
