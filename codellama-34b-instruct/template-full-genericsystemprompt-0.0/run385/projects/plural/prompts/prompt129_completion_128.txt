  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the variable `i` instead of incrementing it, which would cause the loop to run indefinitely or not at all, depending on the initial value of `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the variable `i` by 2 instead of 1, which would cause the loop to skip over some elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would reset the variable `i` to 0 at the end of each iteration, which would cause the loop to run indefinitely.

DONE.
