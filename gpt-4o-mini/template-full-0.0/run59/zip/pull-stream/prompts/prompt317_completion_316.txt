Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the value of `ended` to the callback instead of `null` and `data`, which could lead to incorrect handling of the end state in the consuming code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends `null` for both the error and data parameters, which may cause the consumer to misinterpret the result as a successful operation with no data, rather than indicating the termination of the read process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it indicates a successful termination with a boolean value instead of passing the actual data, which could lead to confusion about the state of the read operation and the data that was processed.

DONE.
