Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for equality instead of inequality, meaning that if the values are the same, the condition will be false, potentially missing differences that should be captured.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] == b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality (==) instead of strict equality (===), which can lead to unexpected results when comparing values of different types, potentially causing false positives in the diff.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `a[key]` is not null, ignoring the case where `b[key]` might be different, thus failing to capture differences when `b[key]` is defined but different from `a[key]`.

DONE.
