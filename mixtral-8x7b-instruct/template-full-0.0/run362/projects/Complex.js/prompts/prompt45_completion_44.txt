 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `parse` function to always treat the input as a string, even if it is a number or an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to throw a `SyntaxError` for any input that is not an object with the correct properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow objects that are instances of the `Object` constructor to be parsed, excluding arrays and other built-in objects like `Map` or `Set`.

DONE.
