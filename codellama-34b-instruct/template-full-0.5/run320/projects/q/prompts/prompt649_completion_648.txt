  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to the `dispatch` method would be reversed, potentially causing the method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with an additional argument, which could cause it to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be sliced, potentially causing the `dispatch` method to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
