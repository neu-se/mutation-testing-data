  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone()` method would create a new `QueryContext` object, which could potentially have different values than the original `ctx` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would return a reversed version of the `ctx` object, which could potentially have different values than the original `ctx` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return a new `QueryContext` object that is a subset of the original `ctx` object, which could potentially have different values than the original `ctx` object.

DONE.
