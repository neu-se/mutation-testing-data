  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof s !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` method would be called even if `s` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` method would be called even if `s` does not have a `sink` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` method would be called regardless of the type of `s`.

DONE.
