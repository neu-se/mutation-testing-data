 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0 && z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for real and imaginary parts being zero, instead of checking the `isZero` method of the Complex object. This might not handle cases where the Complex object's `isZero` method returns true for non-zero values due to floating-point precision issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(z).length === 0
