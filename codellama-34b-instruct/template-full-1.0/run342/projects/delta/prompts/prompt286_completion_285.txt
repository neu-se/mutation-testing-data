  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, end
```
This would result in different behavior because `start` refers to the beginning of a string, while `end` refers to the end of a string. By using `end`, the code would remove the newline from the end of the string, instead of the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' ' + newline
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a space character before the newline, resulting in a string that contains a space and a newline, instead of just a newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a space character after the newline, resulting in a string that contains a newline and a space, instead of just a newline.

DONE.
