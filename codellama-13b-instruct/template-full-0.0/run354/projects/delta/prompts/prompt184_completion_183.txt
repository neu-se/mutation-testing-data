  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would now be comparing the `retain` property of `thisOp` to the string `'object'`, which is not the same as comparing it to the string `'number'`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, depending on the specific values of `thisOp` and `otherOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator would now be comparing the `retain` property of `thisOp` to the value `null`, which is not the same as comparing it to the value `undefined`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, depending on the specific values of `thisOp` and `otherOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior
