Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the promise is in a "fulfilled" state instead of "pending", leading to false positives when determining if a promise is still pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is in a "rejected" state instead of "pending", which would cause the function to incorrectly identify promises that are not yet settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to be called with an undefined argument, potentially leading to a runtime error or unexpected behavior when trying to access the state of the promise.

DONE.
