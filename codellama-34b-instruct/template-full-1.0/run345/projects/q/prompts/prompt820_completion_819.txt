  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks has been reversed, which could potentially cause issues with the correct execution of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, progress, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks has been changed, which could potentially cause issues with the correct execution of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress, fulfilled, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks has been changed, which could potentially cause issues with the correct execution of the code.

DONE.
