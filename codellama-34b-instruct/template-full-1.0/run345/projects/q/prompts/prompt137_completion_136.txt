  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`typeof ReturnValue === "undefined"`
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would invert the original logic, causing the QReturnValue function to always be defined when the `QReturnValue(value)` function is replaced.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`typeof Object(ReturnValue) !== "undefined"`
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would check if the `ReturnValue` object is undefined, which would result in different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`typeof undefined(ReturnValue) !== "undefined"`
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would check if the `ReturnValue` object is undefined when the `undefined` function is called on it, which would result in different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
