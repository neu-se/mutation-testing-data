 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive an empty array as the `args` parameter instead of the actual arguments array, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the correct arguments being passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive `null` as the `args` parameter instead of the actual arguments array, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the correct arguments being passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive a function as the `args` parameter instead of the actual arguments array, causing the `apply` method to fail and potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the correct arguments being passed.

DONE.
