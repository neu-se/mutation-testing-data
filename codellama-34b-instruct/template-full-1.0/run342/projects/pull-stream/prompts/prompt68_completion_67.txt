  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log the error to the console in red, whereas `console.warn` would log it in yellow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` would log the error to the console in white, whereas `console.warn` and `console.error` would log it in yellow or red respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.trace
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.trace` would log the error to the console along with a stack trace, whereas `console.warn` and `console.error` would not.

DONE.
