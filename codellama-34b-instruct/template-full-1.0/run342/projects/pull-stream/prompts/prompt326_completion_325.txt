  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end !== true ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not check whether `end` is truthy or not, while this modified code does, which could result in a different outcome in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end !== false ? end : null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not check whether `end` is falsey or not, while this modified code does, which could result in a different outcome in certain scenarios.
