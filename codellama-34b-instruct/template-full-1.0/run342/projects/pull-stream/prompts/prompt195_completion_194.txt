  Sure, here are the options for possible mutations:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a non-null value to be passed as the first argument to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a defined value to be passed as the first argument to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects an Error object to be passed as the first argument to the callback, and the presence of the error object would cause the program to take a different execution path.

DONE.
