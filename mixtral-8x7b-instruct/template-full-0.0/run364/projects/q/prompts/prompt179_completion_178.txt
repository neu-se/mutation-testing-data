 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"(node:".indexOf(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the stack line contains the string "(node:" instead of checking if it contains "(module.js:". This might cause the `isNodeFrame` function to incorrectly identify a stack line as a Node frame or miss Node frames, affecting the accuracy of stack trace filtering.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stackLine.includes("(node.")
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `includes` method to check if the stack line contains the string "(node." instead of checking if it contains "(module.js:". This might cause the `isNodeFrame` function to incorrectly identify a stack line as a Node frame or miss Node frames, affecting the accuracy of stack trace filtering.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stackLine.search("(module.js:")
```
This would result in different behavior
