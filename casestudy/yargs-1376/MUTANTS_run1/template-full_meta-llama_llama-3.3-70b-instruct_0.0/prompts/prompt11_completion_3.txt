Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'extend'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for a property named 'extend' instead of 'extends', potentially allowing configurations with an 'extends' property to bypass the extend functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'extends' in config
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the 'in' operator, which checks for property existence in the prototype chain, whereas the original code uses 'hasOwnProperty', which only checks the object's own properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.hasOwnProperty('extend')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for a property named 'extend' using the 'hasOwnProperty' method, which is similar to the original code but with a different property name, potentially causing the extend functionality to be triggered incorrectly.

DONE.
