  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is defined later in the code, and calling it immediately would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that is defined later in the code, and calling it immediately would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` would cause the `flush` function to be called after a delay of 1000 milliseconds, whereas the original code calls `flush` immediately.

DONE.
