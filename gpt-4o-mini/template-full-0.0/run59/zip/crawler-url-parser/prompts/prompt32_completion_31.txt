Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol from HTTP to HTTPS, which could lead to different URL resolutions and potentially affect how the URLs are processed, especially if the original URL is not intended to be secure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol to FTP, which is not supported in the subsequent logic that checks for valid HTTP or HTTPS protocols, leading to a potential failure in URL parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://example.com/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes a specific domain instead of using the intended protocol, which could lead to incorrect URL formation and resolution, as it does not reflect the original intent of the URL being parsed.

DONE.
