  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `insert` property is a string and has a non-zero length, but this new code fragment sets `insert` to `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `insert` property is a non-empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `insert` property is a string and has a non-zero length, but this new code fragment sets `insert` to `undefined`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `insert` property is a non-empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = '';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `insert` property is a string and
