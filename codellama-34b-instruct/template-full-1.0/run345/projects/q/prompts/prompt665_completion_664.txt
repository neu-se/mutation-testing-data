  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a different object than `arguments`, and it will produce a different result when passed to `array_slice`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function () {}` is a different object than `arguments`, and it will produce a different result when passed to `array_slice`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an array and it will produce a different result when passed to `array_slice`.

DONE.
