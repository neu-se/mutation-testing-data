  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` would be created with a different name, which would not be recognized by the `setImmediate` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` would be created with a different name, which would not be recognized by the `setImmediate` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` would be created with a different name, which would not be recognized by the `setImmediate` function.

DONE.
