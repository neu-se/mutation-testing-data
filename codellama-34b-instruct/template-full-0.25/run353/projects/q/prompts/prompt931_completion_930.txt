  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the context of the function being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, whereas `apply` and `call` invoke the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the function with an empty array as the argument list, whereas the original code fragment does not specify any arguments.

DONE.
