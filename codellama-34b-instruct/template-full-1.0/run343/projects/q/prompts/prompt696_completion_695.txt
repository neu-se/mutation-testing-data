  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).map(x => x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the arguments passed to the function, which could affect the outcome of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would truncate the `arguments` array, potentially causing the `dispatch` method to receive less data than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice([]).filter(x => x === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty array, which could affect the outcome of the `dispatch` method if it modifies the array in any way.

DONE.
