Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort()` will terminate the archiving process immediately without finalizing the archive, leading to an incomplete or corrupted output file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize({ force: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an options object to `finalize()` is not valid; it will throw an error instead of completing the archiving process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize().then(() => { throw new Error('Finalization failed'); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an artificial error after finalization, which would cause the promise to reject, indicating a failure in the process even if the archiving was successful.

DONE.
