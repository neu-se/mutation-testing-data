  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `apply` method of the callback function, while this option uses the `apply` method of the `args` array, producing a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `apply` method of the callback function, while this option uses the `apply` method of the `deferred` object, producing a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `apply` method of the callback function, while this option uses the `apply` method of the `object` prototype, producing a different output.

DONE.
