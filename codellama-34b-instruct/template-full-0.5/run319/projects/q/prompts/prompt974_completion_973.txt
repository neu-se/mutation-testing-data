  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an object, but `1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an object, but `null` is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value.

DONE.
