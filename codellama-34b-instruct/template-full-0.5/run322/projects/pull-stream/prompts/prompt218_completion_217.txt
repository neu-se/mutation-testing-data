  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bypass the `map` function and return the original data, rather than the mapped data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map(data, function (err, data) {
  // do nothing
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `map` function to be called with a callback that does nothing, rather than passing the original callback.

DONE.
