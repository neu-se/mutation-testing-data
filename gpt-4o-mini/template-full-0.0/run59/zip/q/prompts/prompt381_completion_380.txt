Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Forced rejection"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the promise to be rejected with a specific error, whereas the original code simply returns the promise, which may be fulfilled or pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve("Unexpected value");
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with a string "Unexpected value", which is not the original promise's value, potentially leading to unexpected results in subsequent promise chains.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with the number 42, which is a completely different value than the original promise, affecting any subsequent operations that depend on the original promise's value.

DONE.
