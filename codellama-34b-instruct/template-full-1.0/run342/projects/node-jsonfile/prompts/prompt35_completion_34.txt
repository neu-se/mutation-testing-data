  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"abc"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the PLACEHOLDER is expected to be a string, and the `stringify` method is called to convert the input object to a string. However, if we replace it with a fixed string "abc", the `stringify` method would not be called, and the resulting output would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the PLACEHOLDER is expected to be a boolean value indicating whether to throw an error if the file cannot be read. However, if we replace it with a fixed boolean value `false`, the `readFile` function would not throw an error if the file cannot be read, and the resulting output would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the PLACEHOLDER is expected to be an object with properties
