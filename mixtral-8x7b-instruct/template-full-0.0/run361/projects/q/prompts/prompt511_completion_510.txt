 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects `thisp` to be a valid object, and passing `null` would cause an error in strict mode.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects `thisp` to be a valid object, and passing a number would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects `thisp` to be the desired `this` value for the function call, and passing `window` (or `global` in Node.js) would change the meaning of `this` within the function.

DONE.
