  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a retain operation with a string value of 'delete' as a delete operation, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a retain operation with a string value of 'retain' as a delete operation, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a retain operation with a string value of 'insert' as a delete operation, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
