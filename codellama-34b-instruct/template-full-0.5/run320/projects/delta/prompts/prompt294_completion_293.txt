  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `index + 1` would be passed as the argument to `iter.next()`, which would cause the iterator to skip over the next element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `index - 1` would be passed as the argument to `iter.next()`, which would cause the iterator to move backward in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `index * 2` would be passed as the argument to `iter.next()`, which would cause the iterator to skip over every other element in the array.

DONE.
