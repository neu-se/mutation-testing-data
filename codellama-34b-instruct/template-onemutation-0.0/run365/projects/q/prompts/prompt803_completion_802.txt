  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) {
    return value;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `progressed` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. By replacing it with a function that simply returns its argument, the behavior of the code would change, as the `progressed` function may have been used to modify the value passed to the `progress` callback.

DONE.
