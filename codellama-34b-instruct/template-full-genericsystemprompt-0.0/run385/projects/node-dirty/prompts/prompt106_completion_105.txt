  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `update` method to always set the value of the key to the key itself, rather than the value stored in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `update` method to always set the value of the key to one more than the value stored in the database, rather than the value stored in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `update` method to always set the value of the key to twice the value stored in the database, rather than the value stored in the database.

DONE.
