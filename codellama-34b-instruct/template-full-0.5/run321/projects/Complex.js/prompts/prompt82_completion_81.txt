  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c != 'i' && c != 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the character is equal to 'i' or 'I', while this replacement checks if it is not equal to 'i' or 'I'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the character is equal to 'i' or 'I', while this replacement checks if it is equal to 'j' or 'J'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'k' || c === 'K'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the character is equal to 'i' or 'I', while this replacement checks if it is equal to 'k' or 'K'.

DONE.
