  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when there is an error during the compression process, whereas the `close` event is emitted when the compression is complete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` event is emitted when the compression is complete, whereas the `close` event is emitted when the compression is complete and the output stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the compression is complete and the output stream is closed, whereas the `close` event is emitted when the compression is complete.

DONE.
