  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the word with two 's' characters appended to it, rather than just one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the word with 'es' appended to it, rather than just 's'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the word with the last character removed and 's' appended to it, rather than just 's'.

DONE.
