Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof url === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the original condition, potentially allowing non-string inputs to bypass the subsequent checks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a specific value (`null`) instead of a type, which could lead to different handling of `null` versus other non-string values like numbers or objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `url` is an instance of the `String` constructor, which is a more specific and less common condition than checking if `url` is a string primitive, potentially affecting how string-like objects are handled.

DONE.
