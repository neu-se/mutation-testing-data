  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` argument is not being passed to the `cb` function, which could cause issues if the function is expecting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not the same as the `data` argument, which could cause issues if the function is expecting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not the same as the `data` argument, which could cause issues if the function is expecting it.

DONE.
