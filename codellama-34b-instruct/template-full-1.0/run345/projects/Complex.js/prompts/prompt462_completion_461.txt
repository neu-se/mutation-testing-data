  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because addition in the type of `a` could produce an unintended result. For example, if `a` is a string, concatenation will occur instead of addition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a++
```
This would result in different behavior because post-increment operator will produce a different result than simple addition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ~ b
```
This would result in different behavior because bitwise negation operator will cause the program to crash or produce unexpected result.

DONE.
