  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === undefined` would check if the variable `b` is undefined, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would check if the type of `b` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because `!b` would check if the variable `b` is falsy, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would check if the type of `b` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b !== null` would check if the variable `b` is not null, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would check if the type of `b` is not an object.

DONE.
