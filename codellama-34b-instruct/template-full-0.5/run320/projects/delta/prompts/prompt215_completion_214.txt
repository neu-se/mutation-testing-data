  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, while `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the two arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.push()
```
This would result in different behavior because `push()` adds an element to the end of the array, while `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the two arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the array, while `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the two arrays.

DONE.
