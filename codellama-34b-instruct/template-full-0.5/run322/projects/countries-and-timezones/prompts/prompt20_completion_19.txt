  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezone` is falsy, while this code checks if it is null. If `timezone` is an empty string or an empty object, it would be considered falsy in the original code but not in this code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezone` is falsy, while this code checks if it is undefined. If `timezone` is an empty string or an empty object, it would be considered falsy in the original code but not in this code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezone.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezone` is falsy, while this code checks if it has no length. If `timezone` is an empty string or an empty object, it would
