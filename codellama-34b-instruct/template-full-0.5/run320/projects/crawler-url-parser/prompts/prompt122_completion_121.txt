  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an iterator over the keys in the map, whereas `values()` returns an iterator over the values in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the map, whereas `values()` returns an iterator over the values in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap[Symbol.iterator]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Symbol.iterator` is a symbol that is used to denote the iterator function for an object, and `urlMap[Symbol.iterator]()` would return the iterator function for the map, whereas `values()` would return an iterator over the values in the map.

DONE.
