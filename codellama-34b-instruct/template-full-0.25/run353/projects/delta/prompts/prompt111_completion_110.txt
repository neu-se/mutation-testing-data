  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the end of the `target` array, rather than inserting it at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the beginning of the `target` array, rather than at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the specified index, rather than at the end of the `target` array.

DONE.
