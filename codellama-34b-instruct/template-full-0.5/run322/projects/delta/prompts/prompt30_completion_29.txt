  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not equal to `null`, but the new code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== undefined && attr[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not equal to `null`, but the new code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not equal to `undefined` and not equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== null && attr[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not equal to `null`,
