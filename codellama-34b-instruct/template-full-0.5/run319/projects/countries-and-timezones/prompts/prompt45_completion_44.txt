  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!id
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is the logical NOT operator, which negates the value of the expression `id`. If `id` is a truthy value, `!id` will be falsy, and if `id` is a falsy value, `!id` will be truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is the addition operator, which adds the value of the expression `id` to 1. If `id` is a number, the result will be a different number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the value of the expression `id`, which converts it to a string. If `id` is a number, the result will be a string representation of the number.

DONE.
