  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `path` variable as-is, while the mutated code converts it to lowercase before passing it to the `policy.query()` method. This could cause the method to return a different result, potentially leading to a security vulnerability if the method is used to check permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `path` variable as-is, while the mutated code removes the first character of the `path` string before passing it to the `policy.query()` method. This could cause the method to return a different result, potentially leading to a security vulnerability if the method is used to check permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `path` variable as-is,
