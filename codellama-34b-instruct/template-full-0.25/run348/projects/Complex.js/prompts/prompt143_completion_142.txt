  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `z` is infinite, even if `a` and `b` are not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `z` is not a number, even if `a` and `b` are not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `z` is finite, even if `a` and `b` are not.

DONE.
