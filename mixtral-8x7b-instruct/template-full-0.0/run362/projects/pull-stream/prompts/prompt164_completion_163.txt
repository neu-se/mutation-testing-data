 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function would always call the callback with an error, even if the `abort` signal is not received.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function would stop iterating over the array elements as soon as it is called, instead of iterating until all elements have been processed or the `abort` signal is received.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === i
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function would stop iterating over the array elements one iteration too early, skipping the last element in the array.

DONE.
