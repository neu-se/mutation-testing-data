 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'href'.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the string primitive "href" instead of the "href" property of the DOM element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('body')[0].getAttribute.call(this, 'href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `getAttribute` method of the DOM element, which may behave differently than the jQuery `attr` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.getAttribute('data-href') || this.getAttribute('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it first tries to get the `data-href` attribute, which may not exist, and then falls back to the `href` attribute. This could lead to unexpected results if the `data-href` attribute is used elsewhere in the code.

DONE.
