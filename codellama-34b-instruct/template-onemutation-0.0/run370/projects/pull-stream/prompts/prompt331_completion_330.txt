  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
never()
```
This would result in different behavior because `never()` is a function that always returns `false`, whereas `once()` is a function that returns `true` only the first time it is called. In the original code, `once()` is used to ensure that the `onEnd` callback is only called once, even if the `read` function is called multiple times. By replacing `once()` with `never()`, the `onEnd` callback would never be called, which could cause the stream to become stuck in an infinite loop.
