  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for inequality. This means that the new code fragment will return `true` if the result of `fn(key, val)` is not strictly equal to `false`, while the original code fragment will return `true` only if the result of `fn(key, val)` is strictly equal to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fn(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!` operator, which negates the result of `fn(key, val)`. This means that the new code fragment will return `true` if the result of `fn(key, val)` is `false`, while the original code fragment will return `true` only if
