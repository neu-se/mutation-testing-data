  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = <PLACEHOLDER>(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is not being called, which means that the latitude values are not being converted to radians before being used in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point1.latitude) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is being increased by 1 degree before being used in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point1.latitude) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is being multiplied by 2 before being used in the calculation.

DONE.
