 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `data.countries` object instead of using the `getCountry` function. This change may cause issues if the `data.countries` object contains incomplete or outdated data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
id + ', ' + options
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the `id` and `options` as strings instead of passing them as separate arguments to the `buildCountry` function. This change may cause unexpected behavior in the `buildCountry` function, which expects two separate arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.id
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the `id` property of the `options` object instead of the `id` parameter. This change may cause issues if the `options` object does not have an `id` property or if
