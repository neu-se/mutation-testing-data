  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of the `key` variable, potentially causing the `set` method to store the value at the wrong key in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` variable is the value being stored in the database, and using it as the key would cause the `set` method to store the value at the wrong key in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value stored at the key, rather than the key itself, potentially causing the `set` method to store the value at the wrong key in the database.

DONE.
