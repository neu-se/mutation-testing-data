  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable is not the same as the `promise` variable, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array is not the same as the `unhandledRejections` array, and it may not have the same elements or properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array is not the same as the `unhandledRejections` array, and it may not have the same elements or properties.

DONE.
