  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the value `value`, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { throw value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value `value`, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { return Q.reject(value); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value `value`, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
