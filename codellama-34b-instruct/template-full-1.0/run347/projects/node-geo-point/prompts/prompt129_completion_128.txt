  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a new GeoPoint object with latitude and longitude equal to 0, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(this.latitude, this.longitude + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new GeoPoint object with the same latitude as the input coordinates, but a longitude that is one degree higher.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(this.latitude + Math.random() - 0.5, this.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new GeoPoint object with a random latitude between -0.5 and 0.5, but the same longitude as the input coordinates.

DONE.
