  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value argument is replaced with the key argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value argument is incremented by 1.

DONE.
