  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"](function() { throw new Error("Intentional bug"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` function is now returning a rejected promise, which will be propagated to the outer promise. In the original code, the `finally` function returns the invoked promise, which will be resolved with the return value of the callback function (if any) or rejected with the reason of the promise (if any).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"](function() { return Q().reject("Intentional bug"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` function is now returning a rejected promise with the reason "Intentional bug", which will be propagated to the outer promise. In the original code, the `finally` function returns the invoked promise, which will be resolved with the return value of the callback function (if any) or rejected with the reason of the promise (if any).
