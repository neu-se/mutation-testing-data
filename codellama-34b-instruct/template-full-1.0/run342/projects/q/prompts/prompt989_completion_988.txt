  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would not be called, and the resulting promise would be undefined instead of a slice of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with a null argument instead of an array, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with an empty array instead of the original array, which would return an empty array instead of a slice of the original array.

DONE.
