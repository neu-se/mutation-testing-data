 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw a `SyntaxError` when it encounters `null` instead of the parsed JSON object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.reviver(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver(data)` would attempt to execute the `reviver` function, which might not be a function or could have unintended side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` expects a string as its first argument, and passing an integer would result in a `SyntaxError`.

DONE.
