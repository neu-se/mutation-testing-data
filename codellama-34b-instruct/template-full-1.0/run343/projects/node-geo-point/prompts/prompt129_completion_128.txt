  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
GeoPoint.toTile(this, zoom + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the tile for a different zoom level than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
GeoPoint.toTile(this, zoom - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the tile for a different zoom level than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
GeoPoint.toTile(new GeoPoint(this.longitude, this.latitude), zoom);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the tile for a different longitude and latitude than the original code.

DONE.
