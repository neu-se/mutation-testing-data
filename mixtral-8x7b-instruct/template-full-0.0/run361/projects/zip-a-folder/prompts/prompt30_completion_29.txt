 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'end', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the entire stream has finished, while `close` is emitted when the underlying file descriptor has been closed. This could cause the function to resolve prematurely, before the output stream has finished writing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'finish', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` event is emitted when the underlying file descriptor has been closed and all data has been flushed, making it a more reliable indicator that the output stream has finished writing. However, this event is not part of the Stream interface, but rather a specific event of the Archiver class. This could cause the function to resolve too late, after the output stream has already finished writing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'drain', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is
