  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.promise` instead of `deferred.reject`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject` instead of `deferred.promise.reject`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise.resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject` instead of `deferred.promise.resolve`.

DONE.
