  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh + z['im'] * arg
```
This change will cause the `pow` method to return a different result than the original code, which may reveal a weakness in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg + 1
```
This change will cause the `pow` method to return a different result than the original code, which may reveal a weakness in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg * 2
```
This change will cause the `pow` method to return a different result than the original code, which may reveal a weakness in the test suite.

DONE.
