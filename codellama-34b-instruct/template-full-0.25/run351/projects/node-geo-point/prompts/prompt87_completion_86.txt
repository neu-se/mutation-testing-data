  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `atan2` function to calculate the bearing, which takes into account the quadrant of the angle. The modified code fragment only uses the `sin` and `cos` functions, which do not take into account the quadrant of the angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `atan2` function to calculate the bearing, which takes into account the quadrant of the angle. The modified code fragment uses the `sin` and `cos` functions, which do not take into account the quadrant of the angle, and adds 1 to the result, which would change the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
