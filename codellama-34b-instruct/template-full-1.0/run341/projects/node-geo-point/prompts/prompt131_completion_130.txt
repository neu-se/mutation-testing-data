  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the zoom value is used in the code. In the original code, `zoom` is directly used as an argument in the `toTile()` method, which means it's being treated as a coordinate value. However, with `1 + zoom`, the `toTile()` method would receive a value that is one more than the original `zoom` value, which could potentially result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the zoom value is used in the code. With `zoom * 2`, the `toTile()` method would receive a value that is twice the original `zoom` value, which could potentially result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the zoom
