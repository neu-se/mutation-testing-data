  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ1` and `cosφ1` terms are swapped, which would cause the calculation of `sinφ2` to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ1` and `cosφ1` terms are swapped, which would cause the calculation of `sinφ2` to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ1` and `cosφ1` terms are swapped, which would cause the calculation of `sinφ2` to be incorrect.

DONE.
