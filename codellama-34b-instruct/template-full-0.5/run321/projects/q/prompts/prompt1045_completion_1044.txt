  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `head` property of the `ends.promise` object instead of the `tail` property, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail.next"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `next` property of the `tail` property of the `ends.promise` object instead of the `tail` property itself, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail.promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `promise` property of the `tail` property of the `ends.promise` object instead of the `tail` property itself, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
