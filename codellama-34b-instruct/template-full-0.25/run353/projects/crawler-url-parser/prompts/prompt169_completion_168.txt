  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the last part of the path, but the replacement code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the first part of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/[^\/]*$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the last part of the path, but the replacement code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the first part of the path.
