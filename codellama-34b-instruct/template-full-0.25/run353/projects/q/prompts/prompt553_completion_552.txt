  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the result of the `when` function, potentially causing the promise to be rejected or resolved with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the result of the `when` function, potentially causing the promise to be rejected or resolved with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would change the result of the `when` function, potentially causing the promise to be rejected or resolved with a different value.

DONE.
