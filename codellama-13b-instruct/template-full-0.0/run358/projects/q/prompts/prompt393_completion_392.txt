  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(value, fulfilled, rejected, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function is called with the `value` argument, which is a promise, instead of the `promise` argument, which is a promise. This would cause the `Q.when` function to return a promise that is resolved with the fulfilled value of the `value` promise, rather than the fulfilled value of the `promise` promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, fulfilled, rejected, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function is called with the `promise` argument, which is a promise, instead of the `value` argument, which is a promise. This would cause the `Q.when` function to return a promise that is resolved with the fulfilled value of the `promise` promise, rather than the fulfilled value of the `value` promise.

Option 3:
