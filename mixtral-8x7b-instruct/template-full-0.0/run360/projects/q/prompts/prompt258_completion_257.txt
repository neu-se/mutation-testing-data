 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Q(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because a new instance of Q is being created, which might not be the same as the original Q(value).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the built-in Promise.resolve instead of the Q.resolve method, which might have different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(value).then(function(val) { return val; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra thenable to the resolution process, which might cause the promise to resolve or reject at a different time or in a different way.

DONE.
