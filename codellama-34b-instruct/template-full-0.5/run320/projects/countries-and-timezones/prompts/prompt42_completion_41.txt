  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, options).name }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the country instead of the country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, options).id }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the id of the country instead of the country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, options).timezones.length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of timezones in the country instead of the country object.

DONE.
