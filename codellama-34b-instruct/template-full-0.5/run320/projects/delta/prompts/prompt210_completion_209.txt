  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas `slice` creates a new array with the same elements as the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method creates a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `slice` creates a new array with the same elements as the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.sort((a, b) => a.retain - b.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sort` method sorts the elements of the array, whereas `slice` creates a new array with the same elements as the original array.

DONE.
