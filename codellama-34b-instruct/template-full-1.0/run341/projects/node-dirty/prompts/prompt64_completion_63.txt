  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.close
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called on the write stream, which would close the stream and prevent any further writes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('invalid data')
```
This would result in different behavior because invalid data would be written to the file, which could cause errors when reading the data back.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would be written to the file, which would not cause any errors but would not write any data either.

DONE.
