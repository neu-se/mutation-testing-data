  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](0)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for zero is now comparing a complex number to zero, which may not be the intended behavior. The original code checked whether the complex number is equal to zero in the real and imaginary parts, which is a more accurate check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['im'] === Infinity) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for infinity is now only checking the imaginary part, which may not be the intended behavior. The original code checked whether the complex number is equal to infinity in both the real and imaginary parts, which is a more accurate check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['re'] === -Infinity) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for negative infinity is now only checking the real part, which may not be the intended behavior. The original code checked whether the complex
