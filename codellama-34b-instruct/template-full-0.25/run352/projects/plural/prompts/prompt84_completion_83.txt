Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mous'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the output of the `plural` function for the word "mouse" to "mous" instead of "mice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mou'

This would result in different behavior because it would change the output of the `plural` function for the word "mouse" to "mou" instead of "mice".
