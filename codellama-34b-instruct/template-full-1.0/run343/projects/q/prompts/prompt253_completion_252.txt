  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise instead of using the existing `newPromise` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `resolvedPromise` variable instead of the `newPromise` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `deferred.promise` variable instead of the `newPromise` variable.

DONE.
