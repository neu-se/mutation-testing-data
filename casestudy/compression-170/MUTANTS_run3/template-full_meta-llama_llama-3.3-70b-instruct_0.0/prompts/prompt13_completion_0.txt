Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.writeHead(this.statusCode + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the status code of the response by incrementing it by 1, potentially leading to a different HTTP status being returned to the client.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the 'Content-Type' header of the response to 'text/plain', which might not be the intended content type for the response, potentially causing issues with how the response is handled by the client.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.removeHeader('Content-Length')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the 'Content-Length' header from the response, which could lead to issues with how the response is handled by the client, particularly if the client relies on this header to determine the length of the response body.

DONE.
