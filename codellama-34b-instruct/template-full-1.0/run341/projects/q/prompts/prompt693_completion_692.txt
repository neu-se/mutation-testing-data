  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is not an array, it's an `Array`-like object that includes the arguments passed to a function. Replacing `arguments` with `[arguments]` would create an array with a single element, which is the `arguments` object itself, rather than the expected array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because `...arguments` is a spread operator that expands the `arguments` object into an array. Replacing `arguments` with `[...arguments]` would create an array with the values of the `arguments` object as elements, which is the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return arguments; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function that returns `arguments` as an array. Replacing `arguments` with `function() { return arguments; }` would change the
