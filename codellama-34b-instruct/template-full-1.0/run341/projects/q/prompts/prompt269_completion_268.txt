  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.rejected(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that sets the state of the promise to rejected, whereas `deferred.rejected` is undefined and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `deferred.reject` is a function that sets the state of the promise to rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is a function that sets the state of the promise to rejected, whereas `deferred.reject` is a function that sets the state of the promise to resolved.

DONE.
