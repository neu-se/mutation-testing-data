  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter would be overwritten with an empty object, potentially causing the function to return incorrect results or throw errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter would be overwritten with `null`, potentially causing the function to return incorrect results or throw errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options = { foo: 'bar' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter would be overwritten with a new object that has a different structure and content than the original object, potentially causing the function to return incorrect results or throw errors.

DONE.
