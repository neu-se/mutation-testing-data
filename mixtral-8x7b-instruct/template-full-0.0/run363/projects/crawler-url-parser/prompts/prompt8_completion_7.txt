 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `currentUrl` is truthy and then checks if it's illegal, instead of checking if the `currentUrlStr` has illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!!("currentUrlStr" && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr))
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the string to a boolean before checking if it has illegal characters, which would always return true if the string is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof _has_illegal_chars === "function" && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `_has_illegal_chars` is a function before calling it, which would not catch cases where `_has_illegal_chars`
