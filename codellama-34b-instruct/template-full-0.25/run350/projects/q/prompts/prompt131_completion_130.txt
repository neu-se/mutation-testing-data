  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Object.prototype.toString)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a different function than `uncurryThis`, and it would not have the same effect on the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is a different function than `uncurryThis`, and it would not have the same effect on the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Function.prototype.call)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.prototype.call` is a different function than `uncurryThis`, and it would not have the same effect on the code.

DONE.
