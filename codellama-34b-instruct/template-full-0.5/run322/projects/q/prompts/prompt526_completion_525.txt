  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is used in the `dispatch` function, which would throw an error if it is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is used in the `dispatch` function, which would throw an error if it is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is used in the `dispatch` function, which would not throw an error if it is an empty array.

DONE.
