  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) + 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `val` property would be different from the original code, which could cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correctness of the `val` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) * 2}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `val` property would be different from the original code, which could cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correctness of the `val` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) - 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `val` property would be different from the original code, which could cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correctness
