Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || !targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it will allow the code to proceed if either a custom write stream is provided or if the target file path is not defined, which is the opposite of the original logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it will allow the code to proceed if there is no custom write stream or if the target file path is explicitly `undefined`, which could lead to unexpected behavior when a valid target file path is provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions && !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it will allow the code to proceed if the `zipAFolderOptions` object exists but does not have a custom write stream, which could lead to a situation where the code does not throw an error when it should.

DONE.
