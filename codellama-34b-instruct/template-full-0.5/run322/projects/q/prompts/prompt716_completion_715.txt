  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` would return a new function that has the same behavior as `this.dispatch`, but with a different `this` context. This could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Promise.prototype.keys` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` would call the `dispatch` method with a different `this` context, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Promise.prototype.keys` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(this.dispatch)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve(this.dispatch)` would return a new promise that resolves to the `dispatch` method, rather than calling the method and returning a promise for its
