  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return an empty array, instead of an array containing the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return an array containing only the first two arguments passed to the function, instead of an array containing all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return an array containing all the arguments passed to the function, except for the last one.

DONE.
