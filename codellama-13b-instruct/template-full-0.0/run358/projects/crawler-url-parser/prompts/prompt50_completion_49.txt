  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.resolve` method is used to resolve relative URLs, whereas the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse` method to parse the URL. This would result in different behavior if the URL being parsed is a relative URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method is used to parse the URL, whereas the original code fragment uses the `URL.resolve` method to resolve relative URLs. This would result in different behavior if the URL being parsed is a relative URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.format` method is used to format the URL, whereas the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse` method to parse the URL. This would result in different behavior if the URL being parsed is a relative URL.

DONE.
