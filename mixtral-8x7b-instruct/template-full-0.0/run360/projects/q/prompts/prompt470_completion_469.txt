 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function expects a reason for the unhandled rejection, but it would receive `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function expects a reason for the unhandled rejection, but it would receive an empty object instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the reason for the unhandled rejection as the second argument to `process.emit`, instead of the promise object.

DONE.
