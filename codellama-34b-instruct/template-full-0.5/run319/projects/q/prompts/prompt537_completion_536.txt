  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive `null` as its first argument, which would cause it to throw a `TypeError` instead of spreading the elements of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive `undefined` as its first argument, which would cause it to throw a `TypeError` instead of spreading the elements of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive an empty array as its first argument, which would cause it to return an empty array instead of spreading the elements of the array.

DONE.
