  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the given string starts with the characters of the current string, while `includes` checks if the given string is present anywhere in the current string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the given string in the current string, while `includes` checks if the given string is present anywhere in the current string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` returns a new string that is a subset of the current string, while `includes` checks if the given string is present anywhere in the current string.

DONE.
