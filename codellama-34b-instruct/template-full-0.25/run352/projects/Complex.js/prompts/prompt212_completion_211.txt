  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logHypot(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `logHypot` are swapped, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logHypot(a + b, a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `logHypot` are modified, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logHypot(a * b, a / b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `logHypot` are modified, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
