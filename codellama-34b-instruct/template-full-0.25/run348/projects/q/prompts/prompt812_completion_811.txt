  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not throw an error if the callback returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw an error if the callback returns a rejected promise, while this modified code fragment would return the rejection reason instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return Q.reject(reason);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw an error if the callback returns a rejected promise, while this modified code fragment would return a rejected promise with the rejection reason.

DONE.
