  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.value !== undefined ? row.value : row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because if the row's value is undefined, it will return the key instead, which could cause the program to write incorrect data to the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value, even if it is undefined, which could cause the program to write incorrect data to the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row['val']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value, even if it is undefined, which could cause the program to write incorrect data to the database.

DONE.
