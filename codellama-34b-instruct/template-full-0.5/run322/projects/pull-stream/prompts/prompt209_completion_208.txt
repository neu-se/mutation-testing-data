  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `aborted` variable to `true`, regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `err` variable to `true`, regardless of the value of `aborted`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted = err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `aborted` variable to the same value as `err`, regardless of the original value of `aborted`.

DONE.
