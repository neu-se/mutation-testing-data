  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be subtracting 1 from the length of the word instead of 2. This would cause the code to return the wrong plural form for certain words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the length of the word instead of 2. This would cause the code to return the wrong plural form for certain words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the length of the word by 2 instead of subtracting 2. This would cause the code to return the wrong plural form for certain words.

DONE.
