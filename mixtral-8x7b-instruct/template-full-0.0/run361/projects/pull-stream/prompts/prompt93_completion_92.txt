 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(cb.bind(null, null, data))
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback `cb` would be executed in the next tick of the event loop instead of immediately, which could cause issues if the order of execution is important.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(cb, null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback `cb` would be executed in the next iteration of the event loop instead of immediately, which could cause issues if the order of execution is important.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data), ended = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is being set to true before the callback is executed, which could cause issues if the `ended` variable is being used to check if the callback has been executed.

DONE.
