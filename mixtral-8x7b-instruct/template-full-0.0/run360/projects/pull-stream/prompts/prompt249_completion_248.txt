 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` condition in the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `nextStream()` function to be called even when an abort signal is received.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Boolean(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Boolean` object created with the argument `0` would be evaluated as `false`, causing the `abort` condition in the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, resulting in the same behavior as option 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return the string `"number"`, but the `NaN` value is not considered equivalent to any other value, including itself. Therefore, the `abort` condition in the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `nextStream()` function to be called even
