  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments would be passed in the opposite order, potentially causing the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `undefined` argument would be passed to the method, potentially causing it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because a `null` argument would be passed to the method, potentially causing it to behave differently.

DONE.
