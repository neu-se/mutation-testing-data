Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(line);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the `predicate` function with `line`, it simply logs `line` to the console, which does not allow for any conditional processing or early termination based on the predicate's return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return line;
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the `line` object instead of invoking the `predicate` function, which means that the logic for processing each line is completely bypassed, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the `Delta` operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push({ insert: 'default' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new operation with a default insert value to `line` instead of calling the `predicate`, which could lead to unintended modifications of the `Delta` object without any checks or conditions being applied.

DONE.
