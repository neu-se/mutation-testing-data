  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is replaced with `send`, which may not exist in the object or may have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` and `nodeArgs` arguments are swapped, which may cause the method to behave differently or error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` argument is added to the `nodeArgs` array, which may cause the method to behave differently or error.

DONE.
