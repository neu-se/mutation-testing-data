Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `currentUrlStr` instead of `parsedUrl`, which means the URL resolution would be based on the original URL string rather than the parsed base URL, potentially leading to incorrect URL formatting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it switches the order of the variables, which could affect how the URL is resolved, leading to incorrect base URL usage when constructing the absolute URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl, null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of a valid base URL would cause the URL resolution to fail, potentially resulting in an invalid or undefined URL being returned.

DONE.
