  DONE.  Thank you for the opportunity to demonstrate my expertise in mutation testing.  Here are three potential code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER, along with brief explanations of how they would result in different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally pass the abort signal down the stream, rather than checking for different values as the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the meaning of the abort signal, causing the stream to be aborted instead of being allowed to continue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally fail the abort signal, causing the stream to continue even if it had previously been aborted.

Each of these changes would introduce a different type of bug into the code, and would be detected by
