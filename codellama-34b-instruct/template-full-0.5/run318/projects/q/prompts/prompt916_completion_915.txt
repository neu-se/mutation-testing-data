  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolve method is called with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the reject method is called with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the notify method is called with a different value.

DONE.
