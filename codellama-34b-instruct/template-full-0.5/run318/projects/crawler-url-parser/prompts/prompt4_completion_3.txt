  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will return `true` if either `currentUrlStr` is truthy or `_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)` is truthy, whereas the original code uses the `&&` operator which will only return `true` if both conditions are truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr == _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator will return `true` if `currentUrlStr` is equal to the result of `_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)`, whereas the original code uses the `&&` operator which will only return `true` if both conditions are truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr !== _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr
