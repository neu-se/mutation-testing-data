  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, _value
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, _value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument, specifically `_value + 1` instead of `_value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, _value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different argument, specifically `_value * 2` instead of `_value`.

DONE.
