  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the cosine function would be used instead of the sine function, leading to incorrect results for some input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the absolute value function would be used instead of the sine function, leading to incorrect results for some input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(Math.sin(a), Math.cos(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine and cosine functions would be used together with the power function, leading to a different calculation and incorrect results for some input values.

DONE.
