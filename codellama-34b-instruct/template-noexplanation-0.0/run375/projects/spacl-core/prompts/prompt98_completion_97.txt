  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"name"
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `null`, as the `name` property is a string and will never be `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toLowerCase()
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `null`, as the `name` property is a string and will never be `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `null`, as the `name` property is a string and will never be `undefined`.

DONE.
