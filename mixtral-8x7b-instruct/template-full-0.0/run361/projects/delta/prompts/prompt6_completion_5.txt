 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns only the own enumerable and non-enumerable properties of an object, while `Object.keys` returns only the own enumerable properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['constructor', ...Object.keys(attributes)];
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the `constructor` property to the resulting array, which can cause unexpected behavior when iterating over the keys or when filtering null values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(attributes).filter(key => attributes[key] !== null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the null values from the resulting array, which can cause the function to return an incorrect or incomplete attribute map.

DONE.
