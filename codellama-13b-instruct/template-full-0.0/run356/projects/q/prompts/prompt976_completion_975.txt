  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args || []
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an empty array if `args` is falsy, while the buggy code fragment returns `args` itself if it is falsy. This could cause issues if the code relies on the array being empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args && args.length ? args : []
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an empty array if `args` is falsy, while the buggy code fragment returns `args` itself if it is falsy. This could cause issues if the code relies on the array being empty.
