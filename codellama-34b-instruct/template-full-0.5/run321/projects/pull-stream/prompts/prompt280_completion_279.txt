  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of calling the `mapper` function on `data`, while this modified code fragment returns the result of adding 1 to that result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of calling the `mapper` function on `data`, while this modified code fragment returns the result of subtracting the result of that function from 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of calling the `mapper` function on `data`, while this modified code fragment returns the result of multiplying the result of that function by 2.

DONE.
