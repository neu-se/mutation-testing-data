  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are different objects, and `Object.keys()` would return different keys for each object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[key]` is a different value than `b`, and `Object.keys()` would return different keys for each value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a[key]` is a different value than `b`, and `Object.keys()` would return different keys for each value.

DONE.
