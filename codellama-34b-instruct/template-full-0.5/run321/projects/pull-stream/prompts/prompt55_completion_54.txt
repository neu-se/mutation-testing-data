  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `read`, which is a function, but `null` is not a function and would cause an error if used as one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `read`, which is a function, but `0` is a number and would cause an error if used as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `read`, which is a function, but `undefined` is not a function and would cause an error if used as one.

DONE.
