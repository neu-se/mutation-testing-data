Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` does not pass the arguments as an array, which may lead to incorrect handling of the arguments if `descriptor[op]` expects them in a specific format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the first argument to `apply` means that the function will not be bound to the correct context, potentially leading to unexpected results if `descriptor[op]` relies on `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with `this` set to `promise`, but does not invoke it immediately, which changes the timing of when the function is executed and may lead to different outcomes.

DONE.
