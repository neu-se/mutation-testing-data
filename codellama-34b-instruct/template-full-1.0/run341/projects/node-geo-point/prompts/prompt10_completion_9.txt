  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `hasOwnProperty` check, potentially allowing for the creation of a `GeoPoint` object with invalid properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `Function.prototype.call` method to call the `hasOwnProperty` method with a different `this` object, potentially causing the check to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the existence of a property named `'foo'` instead of `'coordinates'`, which would likely cause the `GeoPoint` constructor to fail.

DONE.
