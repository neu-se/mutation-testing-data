  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throws` property is not defined in the `options` object, and therefore the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property is not defined in the `options` object, and therefore the `JSON.parse()` method would not be called with a reviver function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not defined in the `options` object, and therefore the `fs.readFile()` method would not be called with the correct encoding.

DONE.
