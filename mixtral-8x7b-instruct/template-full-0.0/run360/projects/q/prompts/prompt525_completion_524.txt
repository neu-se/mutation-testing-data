 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the `op` variable, which could cause unexpected results in the `fallback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"new_op"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `op` variable to a string, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior in the `fallback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
