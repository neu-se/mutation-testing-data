  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns a URL object, but `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string. In the context of the `_normalize_options` function, `URL.parse` would cause an error because it expects a string as input, not a URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` resolves a relative URL to an absolute URL, but `URL.format` formats a URL string. In the context of the `extract` function, `URL.resolve` would cause an error because it expects a relative URL as input, not an absolute URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.toString` returns a string representation of a URL object, but `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string. In the context of the `gettype` function
