  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that fulfills the promise with a specific value, while `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a specific reason. Using `resolve` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to fulfill instead of reject, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an exception instead of returning a promise. The `throw` keyword would cause the function to terminate immediately, meaning that any subsequent code in the function would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a specific reason, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
