  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.isInfinite` would refer to the function itself, while `this['isInfinite']` would call the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!this.isInfinite` would negate the result of the function, while `!this['isInfinite']` would negate the function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.isInfinite()` would call the function, while `this['isInfinite']` would refer to the function itself.

DONE.
