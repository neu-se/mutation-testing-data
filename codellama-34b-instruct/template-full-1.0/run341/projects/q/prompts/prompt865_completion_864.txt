  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.delay` method would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.delay` method would return a resolved promise with the value `"foo"` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("bar"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.delay` method would return a rejected promise with the error `Error: bar` instead of the original value.

DONE.
