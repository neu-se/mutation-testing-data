  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `op` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `retain` property to be used instead, leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of the `op` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `insert` property to be used instead, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property of the `op` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `insert` property to be used instead, leading to a different result.

DONE.
