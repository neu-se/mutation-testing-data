 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
nextOp.delete !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison using `typeof` checks if the property exists and is of the specified type, whereas the suggested change checks if the property exists and is not `undefined`. This could lead to different results when the `delete` property exists but has a value other than a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
nextOp.hasOwnProperty('delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because the suggested change checks if the object has the `delete` property directly, while the original code checks if the property has a specific type. This could lead to different results when the object inherits the `delete` property from its prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(nextOp, 'delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because the suggested change uses the `call` method to check if the `delete` property exists
