  As an expert in mutation testing, I will now apply my knowledge to the provided code.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.non_existent_property
```
The original code was `ctx`, which would pass the context object as an argument to the `match` method. By replacing it with `ctx.non_existent_property`, we are accessing a non-existent property in the context object, which would raise an error. This change would result in a different behavior because the `match` method would no longer receive the correct context object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
The original code was `ctx`, which would pass the context object as an argument to the `match` method. By replacing it with a string literal `'foo'`, we are passing a string as an argument, which would cause a type error in the `match` method. This change would result in a different behavior because the `match` method would not receive the correct argument type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced
