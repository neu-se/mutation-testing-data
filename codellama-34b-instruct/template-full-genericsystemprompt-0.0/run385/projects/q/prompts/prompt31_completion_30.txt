  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid argument for the `pop()` method, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid argument for the `pop()` method, but it would not remove any elements from the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid argument for the `pop()` method, but it would remove the first element from the queue, rather than the last element as intended.

DONE.
