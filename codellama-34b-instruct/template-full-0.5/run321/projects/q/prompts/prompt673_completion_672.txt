  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` would return a rejected promise, whereas `Q(object)` would return a promise for the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` would return a rejected promise, whereas `Q(object)` would return a promise for the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q({})` would return a promise for an empty object, whereas `Q(object)` would return a promise for the object.

DONE.
