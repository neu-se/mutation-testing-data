  DONE. Here are three options for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is being passed `a + b` instead of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is being passed `a + b` instead of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is being passed `a + b` instead of `a`.
