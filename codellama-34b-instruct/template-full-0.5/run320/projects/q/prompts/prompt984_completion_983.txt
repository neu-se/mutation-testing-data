  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is used to reject the promise with a reason, while `resolve` is used to fulfill the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` expects a reason as an argument, while `null` would be used to indicate that the promise was fulfilled with no value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is used to reject the promise with a reason, while `notify` is used to notify the promise of progress.

DONE.
