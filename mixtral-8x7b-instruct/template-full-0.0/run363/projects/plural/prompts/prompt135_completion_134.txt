 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'this'
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the string being operated on, rather than the word being tested.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[0][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses the first rule's pattern, rather than the correct pattern for the given word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[i][1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses the result of the i-th rule, rather than the correct result for the given word.

DONE.
