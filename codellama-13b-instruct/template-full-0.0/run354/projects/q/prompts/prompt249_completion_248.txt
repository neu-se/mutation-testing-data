  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("Q.defer")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the stack trace contains the string "Q.defer", which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("Q.defer") + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the stack trace contains the string "Q.defer" and then add 1 to the result, which would result in a different index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("Q.defer") - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the stack trace contains the string "Q.defer" and then subtract 1 from the result, which would result in a different index.

DONE.
