  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is less than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is greater than 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is greater than 0, which would result in a different branch of code being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is less than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to 0, which would result in a different branch of code being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is less than
