  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` are different variables, and using `point2Rad` instead of `point1Rad` would result in a different calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deg2rad(point2.latitude)` is a different expression than `point1Rad`, and using it instead of `point1Rad` would result in a different calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a different constant than `point1Rad`, and using it instead of `point1Rad` would result in a different calculation.

DONE.
