  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring` would return a substring starting from the 0th index, whereas `w.substr` would return a substring starting from the 0th index up to the specified length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.charAt(w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.charAt(w.length - 2)` would return the second-last character of the string, whereas `w.substr` would return the substring starting from the 0th index up to the specified length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice(w.length - 2)` would return a substring starting from the second-last character of the string, whereas `w.substr` would return the substring starting from the 0th index up to the specified
