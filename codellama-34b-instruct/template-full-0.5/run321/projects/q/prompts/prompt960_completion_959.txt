  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array-like object and does not have a `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array does not have the same `length` property as the `arguments` object.

DONE.
