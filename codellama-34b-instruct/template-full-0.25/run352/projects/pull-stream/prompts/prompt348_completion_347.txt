  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value, which is `null` in this case. The original code fragment `test.test` would not have this effect, as it would simply return the `test` function without modifying its `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the `test` function immediately with `null` as its `this` value, whereas the original code fragment `test.test` would simply return the `test` function without invoking it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` invokes the `test` function immediately with `null` as its `this` value, whereas the original code fragment `test.test` would simply return
