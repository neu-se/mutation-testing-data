  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\b(?:truer|false|knive|purse)\b/i, function(w) { return w})
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern matches different words, resulting in different results when the `plural` function is called with these words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\b(?:shirt|skirt)\b/i, function(w) { return w})
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern matches different words, resulting in different results when the `plural` function is called with these words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\b(?:fridge|stove)\b/i, function(w) { return w})
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern matches different words, resulting in different results when the `plural` function is called with these words.

DONE.
