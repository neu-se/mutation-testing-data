  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `decodeURIComponent` function to decode the basename, while this replacement uses the `toLowerCase` method to convert the decoded basename to lowercase. This could cause the test to pass even if the `decodeURIComponent` function is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `decodeURIComponent` function to decode the basename, while this replacement uses the `toUpperCase` method to convert the basename to uppercase. This could cause the test to pass even if the `decodeURIComponent` function is not working correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(pathname).toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `decodeURIComponent` function to
