Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds an extra unit to the index adjustment, potentially causing the index to move beyond the intended position when a delete operation is encountered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the length of the delete operation, which could lead to skipping over more characters than intended, resulting in an incorrect final index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts one from the length, which could cause the index to be adjusted incorrectly, potentially leading to an off-by-one error in the final position calculation.

DONE.
