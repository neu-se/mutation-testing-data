  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && acc
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` if `end` is truthy, regardless of the value of `acc`. This will result in the `cb` function being called with `null` as the first argument, even if `acc` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || acc
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` if `end` is falsy, regardless of the value of `acc`. This will result in the `cb` function being called with `null` as the first argument, even if `acc` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== acc
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` if `end` is not equal to `acc`, regardless of the value of `acc`. This will result in the `cb` function being called with `null`
