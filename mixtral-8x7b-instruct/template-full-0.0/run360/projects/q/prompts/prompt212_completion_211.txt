 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the constructor of `value` is `Promise`, which may not be accurate for all cases, especially if the `Promise` constructor has been replaced or shadowed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Promise]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `toString` method to check the type of `value`, which may not be reliable due to potential custom `toString` implementations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value && typeof value.then === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `value` exists and has a `then` method, which is a more permissive check than the original code. This would consider any object with a `then` method as a promise, even if it doesn't behave like a promise.

DONE.
