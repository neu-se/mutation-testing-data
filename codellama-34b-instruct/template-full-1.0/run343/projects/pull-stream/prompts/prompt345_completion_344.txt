  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true ? null: abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only sets the return value to `null` if `abort` is strictly equal to `true`, while the new code fragment sets the return value to `null` if `abort` is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null: abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only sets the return value to `null` if `abort` is strictly equal to `false`, while the new code fragment sets the return value to `null` if `abort` is not strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort ? null: abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only sets the return value to `null` if `abort` is falsy, while the new code fragment sets the return value to `null`
