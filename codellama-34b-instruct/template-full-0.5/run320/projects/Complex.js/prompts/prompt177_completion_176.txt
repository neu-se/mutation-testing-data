  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the real part of the complex number, rather than the magnitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the imaginary part of the complex number, rather than the magnitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, rather than the magnitude.

DONE.
