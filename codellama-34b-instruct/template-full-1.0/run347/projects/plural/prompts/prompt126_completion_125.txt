  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `num` being `1` and `num` being `undefined`, whereas this new code fragment only checks for `num` being `1`. If `num` is `undefined`, the original code fragment would return the plural form of the word, but this new code fragment would return the singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 && num !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `num` being `1` and `num` being `undefined`, whereas this new code fragment only checks for `num` being not `1` and not `undefined`. If `num` is `undefined`, the original code fragment would return the plural form of the word, but this new code fragment would return the singular form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || typeof num === 'undefined'
```
