  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```makeGenerator()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator()` function would be called immediately instead of being passed as an argument, which would likely cause an error because `makeGenerator()` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the placeholder would be replaced with the literal string `<PLACEHOLDER>`, which would cause a syntax error because `<PLACEHOLDER>` is not a valid JavaScript identifier.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (){ }
```
This would result in different behavior because the placeholder would be replaced with an empty function, which would not have the same effect as passing `makeGenerator` as an argument to `Q.async()`.

DONE.
