  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone name in lowercase, which may not be present in the `data.timezones` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone name without the first character, which may not be present in the `data.timezones` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.split(' ')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first word of the timezone name, which may not be present in the `data.timezones` object.

DONE.
