  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 'geese' for the plural form of 'goose', while the new code fragment returns 'goose' for the plural form of 'goose'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 'geese' for the plural form of 'goose', while the new code fragment returns 'gooses' for the plural form of 'goose'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gosling'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 'geese' for the plural form of 'goose', while the new code fragment returns 'gosling' for the plural form of 'goose'.

DONE.
