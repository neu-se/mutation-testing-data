  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(timezones), options
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of values, whereas the original code fragment returned an object that had variable names as keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.length, options
```
This would result in different behavior because `timezones.length` returns the number of elements in the `timezones` array, whereas the original code fragment returned an object that had variable names as keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.filter(tz => tz.deprecated), options
```
This would result in different behavior because `timezones.filter` returns a new array with only the elements that satisfy the given condition, whereas the original code fragment returned an object that had variable names as keys.

DONE.
