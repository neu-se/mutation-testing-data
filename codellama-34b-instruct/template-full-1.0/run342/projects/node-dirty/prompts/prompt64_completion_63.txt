  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
this._writeStream.end(new Error('Simulated error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method accepts an optional error argument, and the new code fragment would simulate an error in the write stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method completes the stream without any data, whereas the original code fragment wrote data to the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Simulated error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method destroys the stream with an error, whereas the original code fragment did not handle errors when destroying the stream.

DONE.
