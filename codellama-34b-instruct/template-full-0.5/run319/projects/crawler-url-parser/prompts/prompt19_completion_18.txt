  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol of the base URL with "https", which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently by the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://www.');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the "www." subdomain to the base URL, which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently by the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://localhost:8080/');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol and domain of the base URL with "http://localhost:8080/", which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently by the application.

DONE.
