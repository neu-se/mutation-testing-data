  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` only passes the `data` argument to the callback, while this new code fragment passes both `null` and `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` only passes two arguments to the callback, while this new code fragment passes three arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` only passes two arguments to the callback, while this new code fragment passes three arguments, and the third argument is the same as the second argument.

DONE.
