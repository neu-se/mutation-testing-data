  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length` would always be truthy, even if `messages` is empty, which would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, rather than waiting for the `messages` array to be populated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length > 0` would only be truthy if the `messages` array has at least one element, which would cause the promise to be resolved only if there are messages to process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length === 0` would only be truthy if the `messages` array is empty, which would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, rather than waiting for the `messages` array to be populated.

DONE.
