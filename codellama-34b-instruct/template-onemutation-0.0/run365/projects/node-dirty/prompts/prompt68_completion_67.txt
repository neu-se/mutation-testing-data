  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!this.path` would evaluate to `true` if `this.path` is `undefined`, but `this.path === undefined` would only evaluate to `true` if `this.path` is both `undefined` and `null`.

DONE.
