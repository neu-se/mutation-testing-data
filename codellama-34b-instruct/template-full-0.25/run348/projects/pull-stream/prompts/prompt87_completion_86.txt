  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb !== null` is always true, whereas `!cb` is only true when `cb` is falsey (i.e., `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof cb !== 'function'` is only true when `cb` is not a function, whereas `!cb` is only true when `cb` is falsey.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb.length === 0` is only true when `cb` is an empty array or an empty string, whereas `!cb` is only true when `cb` is falsey.

DONE.
