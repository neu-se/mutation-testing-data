  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fapply` method accepts a function with the nodeArgs and returns a promise, but the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `fapply`, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fapply` method accepts a function with the nodeArgs and returns a promise, but the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `fapply`, which is incorrect. The `deferred.reject` method is called without arguments, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).get
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fapply` method accepts a function with the nodeArgs and returns a promise, but the `get` method is
