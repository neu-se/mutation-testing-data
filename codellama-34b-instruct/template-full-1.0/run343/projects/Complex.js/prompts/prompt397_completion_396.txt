  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos']
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse cosine function, while `asin` is the inverse sine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asec']
```
This would result in different behavior because `asec` is the inverse secant function, while `asin` is the inverse sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acot']
```
This would result in different behavior because `acot` is the inverse cotangent function, while `asin` is the inverse sine function.

DONE.
