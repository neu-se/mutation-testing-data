  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into an array of lines, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into an array of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into an array of lines, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into an array of words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into an array of lines, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into an array of characters.

DONE.
