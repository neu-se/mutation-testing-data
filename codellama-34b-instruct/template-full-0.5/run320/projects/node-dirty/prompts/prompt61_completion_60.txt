  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` will close the read stream immediately, whereas `destroy()` will close the stream only when all data has been read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.pause()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pause()` will temporarily stop the read stream, whereas `end()` and `destroy()` will close the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.resume()
```
This would result in different behavior because `resume()` will resume the read stream, whereas `end()` and `destroy()` will close the stream.

DONE.
