Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'nonexistentFile.txt'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always attempt to read a file that does not exist, leading to an error being thrown regardless of the actual file intended to be read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the file argument to `fs.readFileSync` will likely cause a TypeError, as `null` is not a valid file path, whereas the original code expects a string representing the file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + 'extraString'
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the file path by appending 'extraString', which will cause the function to look for a different file than originally intended, potentially leading to a file not found error.

DONE.
