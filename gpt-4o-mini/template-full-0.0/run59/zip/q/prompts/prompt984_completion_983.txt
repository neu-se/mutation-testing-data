Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise when an error occurs, it would resolve the promise, potentially leading to incorrect handling of errors in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("An error occurred")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a specific error message instead of the original error, which could change how the error is handled downstream in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Custom error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a new Error object containing a custom message, which could affect how error handling is implemented in the consuming code, as it would not match the original error context.

DONE.
