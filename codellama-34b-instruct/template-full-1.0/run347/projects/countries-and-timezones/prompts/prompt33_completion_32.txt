  Sure, I can help you with that! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the `min` property of the `tz` object, rather than using the property's value directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(min * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `min` property by 2 and then round the result down to the nearest integer, rather than using the property's value directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(min / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the `min` property by 60 and then round the result up to the nearest integer, rather than using the property's value directly.

DONE.
