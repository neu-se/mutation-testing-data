 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Delta(thisIter.rest())
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Delta object with the rest of the operations from the current iterator, instead of using the `rest()` method from the original code fragment. This could lead to different behavior if the `Delta` constructor has side effects or if it behaves differently than the `rest()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly returns the rest of the operations from the current iterator, instead of passing it to the `Delta` constructor. This could lead to different behavior if the `Delta` constructor has side effects or if it behaves differently than the `rest()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `iter` variable instead of the `thisIter` variable. This could lead to different behavior
