  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is never null in the original code, so the if statement would never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is always defined in the original code, so the if statement would never be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done = false
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is always truthy in the original code, so the if statement would never be executed.

DONE.
