Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from `args` (which is expected to be an array of arguments) to `null`, potentially causing the method invocation to fail or behave incorrectly due to missing arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments, passing `args` as the first parameter and `name` as the second, which could lead to incorrect method invocation or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps `args` in an additional array, changing the structure of the arguments being passed to the method and potentially causing it to misinterpret the intended parameters.

DONE.
