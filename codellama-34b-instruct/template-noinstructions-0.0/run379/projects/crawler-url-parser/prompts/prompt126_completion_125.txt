  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter is not being passed to the `parse` function, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrlStr, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` parameter is being passed to the `parse` function, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrlStr, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter is being passed to the `parse` function, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
