  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//g) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the match to be performed globally, which would return `true` if there is at least one instance of `//` in the string, regardless of its position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/(\/\/)/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses around the `//` pattern would cause the match to only be performed against the entire string, and not against each individual segment of the string. This would cause the error message to be triggered more frequently, as it would match on any segment of the string that contains `//`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[/]{2}/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the square brackets around the `/` pattern would cause the match to only be performed against the entire string, and
