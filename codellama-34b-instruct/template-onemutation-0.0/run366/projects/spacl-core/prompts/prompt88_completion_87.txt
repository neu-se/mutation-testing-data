  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas the `map` method returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array. In this case, the `filter` method would remove any policies with an undefined `name` property, which could potentially cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
