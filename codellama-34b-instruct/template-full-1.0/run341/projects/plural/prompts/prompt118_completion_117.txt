  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/neg$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the letters "ics" in any position in the string, but the new code fragment matches the letters "neg" in any position in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/m$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the letter "m" in any position in the string, but the new code fragment matches the letters "m" and "ic" in any position in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nds$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the letters "nds" in any position in the string, but the new code fragment matches the letters "nds" only when they are at the end of the string.

DONE.
