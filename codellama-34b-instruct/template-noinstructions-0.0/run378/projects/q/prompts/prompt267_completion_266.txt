  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called with the `reason` argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the given reason, whereas the original code fragment `become(reject(reason))` would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason "reject".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function is called with the `reason` argument, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the given reason, whereas the original code fragment `become(reject(reason))` would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason "reject".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(new Error(reason)));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called with a new `Error` object constructed with the `reason`
