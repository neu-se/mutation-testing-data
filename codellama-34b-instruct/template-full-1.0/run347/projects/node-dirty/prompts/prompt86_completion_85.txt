  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be looking for tabs instead of newlines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be looking for spaces instead of newlines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be looking for the empty string instead of newlines.

DONE.
