Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] === base[key] && base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly include attributes where the values are equal and the base value is defined, which is the opposite of the intended logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] || base[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow attributes to be included even if the base value is null, which would not be the case in the original logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] === undefined || base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include attributes when either the attribute is undefined or the base value is undefined, which changes the original condition's intent.

DONE.
