 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = lines.length - 1; i >= 0; --i
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates through the array in reverse order, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 1; i < lines.length; ++i
