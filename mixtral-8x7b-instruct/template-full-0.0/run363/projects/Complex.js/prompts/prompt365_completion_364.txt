 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns a value between -1 and 1, while `cosh` can return values greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a / 2) - Math.exp(-a / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because this expression calculates the hyperbolic cosine using the exponential function, but it does not take into account the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.E` is a constant and does not take into account the value of the complex number.

DONE.
