  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `data`, and it would cause the `op` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `data`, and it would cause the `op` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `data`, and it would cause the `op` function to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
