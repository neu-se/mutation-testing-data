  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the `hasNext()` method to return `false` when the length is 1, even though there is still an operation to be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and adding 1 to it would cause the `hasNext()` method to return `true` when the length is 0, even though there are no more operations to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the `hasNext()`
