  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag tells the regular expression to match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` at the beginning and end of the regular expression indicate that it should match the entire string, not just a part of it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag tells the regular expression to match case-insensitively, so the regular expression would match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

DONE.
