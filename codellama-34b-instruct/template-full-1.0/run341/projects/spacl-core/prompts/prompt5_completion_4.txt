  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` checks if a pattern exists in a string, while `search` looks for the first occurrence of a pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` checks if a pattern exists in a string, while `includes` searches for a given string within another string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.find
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` checks if a pattern exists in a string, while `find` searches for a given string within another string and returns the index of the first occurrence.

DONE.
