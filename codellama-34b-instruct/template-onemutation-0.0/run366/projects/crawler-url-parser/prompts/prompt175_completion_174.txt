  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype
```
This would result in different behavior because `gettype` is a function that returns the type of a link, while `parse` is a function that parses a URL and returns an object with its components. Using `gettype` instead of `parse` would cause the code to return the type of the link instead of the parsed URL, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
