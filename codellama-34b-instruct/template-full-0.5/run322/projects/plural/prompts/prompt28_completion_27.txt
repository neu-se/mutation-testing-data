  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove one more character from the end of the word, resulting in a different plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all characters from the end of the word, resulting in a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire word instead of a plural form, resulting in a different output.

DONE.
