  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because a different comparison operator, `<`, is used, which would return true if the `part_count_diff` is less than -1, whereas the original code fragment would only return true if `part_count_diff` is exactly equal to -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because a different comparison operator, `===`, is used, which would return true only if `part_count_diff` is exactly equal to -1 AND has the same type as -1, whereas the original code fragment would return true if `part_count_diff` is exactly equal to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff >= -1
```
This would result in different behavior because a different comparison operator, `>=`, is used, which would return true if `part_count_diff
