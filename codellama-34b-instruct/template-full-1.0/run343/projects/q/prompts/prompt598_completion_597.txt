  To apply mutation testing to the provided code, we can consider three different options for replacing the `PLACEHOLDER` with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
Promise.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.race` is a method that returns a new `Promise` that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the elements in the iterable argument it is called on fulfills or rejects, with the corresponding value or reason from that element. In contrast, the original code fragment `PLACEHOLDER` is a placeholder for the actual argument to be passed to the `dispatch` method, which would typically be an object or a string representing the property to be accessed.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` is a method that returns a new `Promise` that is resolved with the given value. In contrast, the original code
