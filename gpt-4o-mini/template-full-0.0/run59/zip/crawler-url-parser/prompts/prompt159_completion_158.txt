Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"non-empty"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return "samelevel" for any link URL that has the same path as the page URL, regardless of whether they are actually at the same level in the URL hierarchy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path + "/extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the comparison to check if the link URL's path without the last part is equal to the page URL's path plus an additional segment, which would never be true, thus preventing the "samelevel" classification even when the URLs are at the same level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path + "/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a trailing slash to the link URL's path, which could lead to false negatives in the comparison, causing URLs that are actually at the same level to be classified incorrectly.

DONE.
