  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `i` variable by 1, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip every other line in the document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `i` variable by 1, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip every other line in the document, but in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of the `i` variable, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip every other line in the document, but with a different pattern.

DONE.
