  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w. charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `charAt(0)` returns the first character of the string, while `substr(0, w.length - 1)` returns the substring starting from the first character and ending at the second-to-last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns the substring starting from the second character, while `substr(0, w.length - 1)` returns the substring starting from the first character and ending at the second-to-last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the characters in the string, while `substr(0, w.length - 1)` returns the substring starting from the first character and ending at the second-to-last character.

DONE.
