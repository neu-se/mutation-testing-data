  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => {};
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to always be an empty function, which will not have the same behavior as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = (err) => { throw err; };
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to throw an error if it is called with an argument, which will not have the same behavior as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = (err) => { console.log(err); };
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to log an error to the console if it is called with an argument, which will not have the same behavior as the original code fragment.

DONE.
