  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the insert operation, which could cause the code to skip over some of the characters in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the insert operation, which could cause the code to miss some of the characters in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the insert operation, which could cause the code to process the same character twice.

DONE.
