  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => true
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function always returns true, regardless of the input, which would cause the filter function to return all elements in the array, rather than only the elements that satisfy the predicate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => false
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function always returns false, regardless of the input, which would cause the filter function to return an empty array, regardless of the contents of the input array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function checks whether the `insert` property of the `op` object is not null, which would cause the filter function to return only the elements that have a non-null `insert` property, rather than all elements that satisfy the predicate.

DONE.
