  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx === undefined` checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while `ctx === null` checks if `ctx` is `null`. If `ctx` is `null`, the result of the comparison would be different, and the behavior of the method would be affected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx !== undefined` checks if `ctx` is not `undefined`, while `ctx === undefined` checks if `ctx` is `undefined`. If `ctx` is not `undefined`, the result of the comparison would be different, and the behavior of the method would be affected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because `!ctx` checks if `ctx` is falsy (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `false`, etc.), while `ctx === undefined` checks
