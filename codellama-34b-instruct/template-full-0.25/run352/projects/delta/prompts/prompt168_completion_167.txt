  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to use the wrong iterator, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to use the wrong value, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to use the wrong value, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
