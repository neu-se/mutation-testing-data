  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encode()
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encode()` would return the encoded version of `options`, which is not what the original `options` variable represents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ encode: 'utf-8', space: 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new object literal would have different properties and values, which would cause the containing function to execute differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
async (options) => {
    try {
        await getOptions()
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error)
    }
    return options
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function would have a different behavior when it encounters an error, which would cause the containing function to execute differently.

DONE.
