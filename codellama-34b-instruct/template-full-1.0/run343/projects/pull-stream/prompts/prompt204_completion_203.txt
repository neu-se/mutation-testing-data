  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in the `abortCb` function being called with the `aborted` argument, which would cause the `next` function to return a different value than it would when `cb` is called with the `aborted` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This would result in the `next` function returning the `aborted` value instead of the `cb` function, which would cause the `next` function to return a different value than it would when `cb` is called with the `aborted` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted)
```
This would result in the `cb` function being called with the `aborted` argument, which would cause the `next` function to return the same value as it would when `cb` is called with the `aborted` argument. However, this would also cause the `abortCb
