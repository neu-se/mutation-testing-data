  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with only two arguments, instead of three, and the `onAbort` callback would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the `abort` argument before the `cb` argument, instead of after, and the `onAbort` callback would be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the `null` argument as the first argument, instead of the `cb` argument, and the `onAbort` callback would be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
