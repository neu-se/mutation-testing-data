  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, while `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number, while `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number.

DONE.
