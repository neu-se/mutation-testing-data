 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not called, and the promise remains unresolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise is always resolved, even when an error occurs, and the error is not passed along.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise's state is changed to "notified" instead of "rejected", which may not be handled correctly by the test suite.

DONE.
