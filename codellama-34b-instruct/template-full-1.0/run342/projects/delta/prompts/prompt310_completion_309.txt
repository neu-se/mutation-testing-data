  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const dummyOp = new Op('retain', -1, 1); // negative length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length(op)` would return `-1` for `dummyOp`, which would cause the `while` loop to terminate early, even if `thisIter` has more ops to iterate over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const dummyOp = new Op('insert', 'dummy', 0); // zero length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length(op)` would return `0` for `dummyOp`, which would cause the `while` loop to continue iterating over `thisIter` even if `otherIter` has more ops to iterate over.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const dummyOp = new Op('insert', 'dummy', -1); // negative retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length(op)` would return `-1
