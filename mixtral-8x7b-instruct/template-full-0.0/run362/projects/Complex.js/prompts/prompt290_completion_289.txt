 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the imaginary part of the result, regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the same value for both the real and imaginary parts of the result, which is not consistent with the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reciprocal of the imaginary part of the input, which is not the intended behavior of the `cos` method.

DONE.
