Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if `pageurl_path` begins with `linkurl_path`, which is a stricter condition than `includes`, potentially missing cases where `linkurl_path` appears later in `pageurl_path`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path === pageurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because using the strict equality operator `===` checks for exact matches between `linkurl_path` and `pageurl_path`, whereas `includes` allows for partial matches, leading to different outcomes in the logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.indexOf(linkurl_path) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` checks if `linkurl_path` is not present in `pageurl_path`, which would invert the logic of the original `includes` check, potentially leading to incorrect categorization of the URL types.

DONE.
