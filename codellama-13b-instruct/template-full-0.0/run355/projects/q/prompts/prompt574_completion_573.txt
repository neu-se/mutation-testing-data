  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object in the context of the `async` function, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `makeGenerator` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object refers to the arguments passed to the `async` function, whereas the original code fragment refers to the arguments passed to the `makeGenerator` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression evaluates to `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `makeGenerator` function.

DONE.
