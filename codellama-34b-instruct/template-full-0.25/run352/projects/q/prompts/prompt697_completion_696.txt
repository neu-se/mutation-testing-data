  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a slice of the `arguments` object starting from the second element, whereas the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a slice of the `arguments` object starting from the third element, whereas the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a slice of the `arguments` object starting from the fourth element, whereas the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object as is.

DONE.
