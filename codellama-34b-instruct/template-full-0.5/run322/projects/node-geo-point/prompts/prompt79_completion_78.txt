  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which could cause the calculation to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude value, which could cause the calculation to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the latitude value, which could cause the calculation to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
