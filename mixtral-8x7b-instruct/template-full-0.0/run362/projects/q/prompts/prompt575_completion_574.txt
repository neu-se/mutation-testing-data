 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.bind.call(continuer, continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Function.prototype.bind.call` instead of `continuer.bind`, which may not correctly set the `this` context for the `continuer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
continuer.bind(null, "next")
