  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `acc` and `data` values instead of reducing them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the `data` value from the `acc` value instead of reducing them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `acc` and `data` values instead of reducing them.

DONE.
