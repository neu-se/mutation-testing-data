  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `err && err.message` would always evaluate to `false` if `err` is not an object, whereas the original code would return `true` if `err` is any non-null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err !== true` would return `false` if `err` is `true`, whereas the original code would return `true` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because `!err` would always evaluate to `true` if `err` is not defined, whereas the original code would return `false` if `err` is not defined.

DONE.
