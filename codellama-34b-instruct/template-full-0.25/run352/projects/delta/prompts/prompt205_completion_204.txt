  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete === 0 &&
          (thisOp.retain === 0 ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `otherOp.delete` is a number, but the modified code checks if it is equal to 0. This could cause the code to behave differently if `otherOp.delete` is a number but not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete === null &&
          (thisOp.retain === null ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `otherOp.delete` is an object, but the modified code checks if it is null. This could cause the code to behave differently if `otherOp.delete` is an object but not null.

Option 3: The PLACE
