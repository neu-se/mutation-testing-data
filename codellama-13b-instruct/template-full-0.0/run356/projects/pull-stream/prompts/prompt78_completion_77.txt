  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` function is called recursively, which can cause a stack overflow if the stream is synchronous.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` function is called and the result is returned, which can cause the loop to exit prematurely if the stream is synchronous.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (loop) next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` function is only called if the `loop` variable is truthy, which can cause the loop to exit prematurely if the stream is synchronous.

DONE.
