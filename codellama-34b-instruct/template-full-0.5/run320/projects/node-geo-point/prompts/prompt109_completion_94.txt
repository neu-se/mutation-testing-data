  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment raises 2 to the power of `zoom`, while this new code fragment raises 2 to the power of `zoom + 1`. This would cause the `x` value to be off by a factor of 2, resulting in an incorrect tile number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment raises 2 to the power of `zoom`, while this new code fragment raises 2 to the power of `zoom - 1`. This would cause the `x` value to be off by a factor of 1/2, resulting in an incorrect tile number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
