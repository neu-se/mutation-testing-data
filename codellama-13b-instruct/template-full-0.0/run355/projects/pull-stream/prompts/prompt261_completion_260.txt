  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the data argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with both the data and the error arguments. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the error argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the data argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with both the error and the data arguments. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the error argument.
