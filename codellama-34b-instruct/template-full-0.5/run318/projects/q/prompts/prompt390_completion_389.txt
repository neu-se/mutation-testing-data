  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is a different function than `rejected`, and it would change the outcome of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than resolved or rejected as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return early, rather than continuing to the next line of code.

DONE.
