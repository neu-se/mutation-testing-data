  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `isArray` checks if a value is an array, while `isObject` checks if a value is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number, while `isObject` checks if a value is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isObject` checks if a value is an object.

DONE.
