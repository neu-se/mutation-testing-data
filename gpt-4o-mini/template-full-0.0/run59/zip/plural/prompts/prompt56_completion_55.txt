Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'veses'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds an extra 'e' to the plural form, resulting in an incorrect pluralization for words like "life" which should become "lives" but would incorrectly become "liveses".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'veses'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected pluralization rule, causing words that should end in 'ves' to incorrectly end in 'veses', which is not a valid plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'vesd'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a completely incorrect suffix, resulting in words like "knife" becoming "knifed" instead of the correct "knives".

DONE.
