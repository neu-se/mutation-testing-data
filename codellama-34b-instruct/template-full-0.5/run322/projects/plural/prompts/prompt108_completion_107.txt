  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always add an "s" to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always add "es" to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always remove the last letter of the word and replace it with "ies", regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

DONE.
