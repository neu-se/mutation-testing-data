  Sure, here are three possible mutations and their explanations:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Mutation error');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextTick` function to throw an error, which would not be caught by the `try-catch` block and would propagate up the call stack. This would cause the `Q` function to exit early and return `undefined`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the task to be set to `null`, which would be a valid but unexpected value. This could cause the `runSingle` function to fail or behave unexpectedly, depending on how it is handled by the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the task to be set to `0`, which is a valid
