Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array containing the matched strings, whereas `split` returns an array of substrings split from the original string, potentially leading to different tokenization results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` returns a new string with the replaced values, rather than an array of tokens, which would cause the subsequent code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` returns a subset of the original string, rather than an array of tokens, and would require additional parameters to specify the start and end indices of the substring, which would not match the expected output of the original `split` method.

DONE.
