  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rejection reason instead of throwing it, which would prevent the promise from being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return Q.reject(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with the rejection reason, which would cause the promise chain to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error with the rejection reason, which would cause the promise chain to be rejected.

DONE.
