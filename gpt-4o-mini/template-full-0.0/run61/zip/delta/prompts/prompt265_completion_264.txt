Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of deleting the operation, it retains one unit of the operation, which could lead to incorrect state in the delta as it would not remove the intended content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).insert('bug');
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to insert a string 'bug' instead of deleting the operation, which would change the content of the delta rather than removing it, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).delete(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete zero units of the operation, effectively making no change to the delta, which contradicts the intended behavior of removing the operation.

DONE.
