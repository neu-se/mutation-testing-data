  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last part of the path instead of the last part of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)$/, "") + "some_extra_path"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra path to the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)$/, "") + "?" + some_query_parameters
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add some query parameters to the URL.

DONE.
