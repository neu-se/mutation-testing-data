  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||` to check if either `this._queue.size` or `this._inFlightWrites > 0` is true, while the new code fragment uses the logical AND operator `&&` to check if both conditions are true. This would cause the `_flush` method to be called more frequently, as it would be triggered by both the presence of items in the queue and the presence of in-flight writes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0 || this._inFlightWrites === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||` to check if either `this._queue.size` or `this._inFlightWrites > 0` is true, while the new code fragment uses the logical AND operator `===` to check
