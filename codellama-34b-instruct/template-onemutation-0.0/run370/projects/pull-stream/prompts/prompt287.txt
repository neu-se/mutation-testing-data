Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'

function id (e) { return e }
var prop = require('../util/prop')

module.exports = function map (mapper) {
  if(!mapper) return id
  mapper = prop(mapper)
  return function (read) {
    return function (abort, cb) {
      read(abort, function (end, data) {
        try {
        data = !end ? mapper(data) : null
        } catch (err) {
          return read(err, function () {
            return cb(err)
          })
        }
        cb(end, <PLACEHOLDER>)
      })
    }
  }
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
data
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
