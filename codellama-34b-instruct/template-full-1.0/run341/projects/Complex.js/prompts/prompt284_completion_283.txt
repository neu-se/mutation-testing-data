  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.abs` method to compute the absolute value of a number, while the mutant uses the negation operator to negate the value. The resulting difference in behavior is the sign of the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.abs` method to compute the absolute value of a number, while the mutant always returns 0 regardless of the input. The resulting difference in behavior is that the mutant always returns 0, while the original function returns a non-zero value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.abs` method to compute the absolute value of a number, while the mutant always returns 1 regardless of the input. The resulting difference in behavior is that the mutant always returns 1, while the original
