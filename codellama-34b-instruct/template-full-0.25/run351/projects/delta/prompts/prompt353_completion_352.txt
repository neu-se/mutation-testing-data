  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument of `1`, which would remove the first element of the `inverted` array, rather than removing all elements with a value of `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes the last element of the `inverted` array, rather than removing all elements with a value of `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes the first element of the `inverted` array, rather than removing all elements with a value of `0`.

DONE.
