  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with a different set of arguments, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with a different set of arguments, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with a different set of arguments, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected with a different value than expected.

DONE.
