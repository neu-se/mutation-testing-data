  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be incremented by 1, which could cause unexpected behavior in the application that uses the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be set to null, which could cause errors in the application that uses the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be set to undefined, which could cause unexpected behavior in the application that uses the database.

DONE.
