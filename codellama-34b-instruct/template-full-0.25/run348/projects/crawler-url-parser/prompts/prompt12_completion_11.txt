  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `http` protocol, while the replaced code fragment uses the `https` protocol. This could cause the URL parsing to behave differently, especially if the URL being parsed includes a protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `http` or `https` protocol, while the replaced code fragment uses the `ftp` protocol. This could cause the URL parsing to behave differently, especially if the URL being parsed includes a protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `http` or `https` protocol, while the replaced code fragment uses the `file` protocol. This could cause the URL parsing to behave differently, especially if the URL being parsed includes a protocol.

DONE.
