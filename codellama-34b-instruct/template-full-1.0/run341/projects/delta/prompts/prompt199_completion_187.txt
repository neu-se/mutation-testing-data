  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the current op, rather than the remaining ops in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the current op in the other iterator, rather than the remaining ops in the current iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the list of ops in the delta, rather than the ops remaining in the iterator.

DONE.
