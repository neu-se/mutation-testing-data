 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.callee.caller.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the arguments of the outer function, not the array_slice function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass null as the second argument to the dispatch method, instead of the expected array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the current object as the second argument to the dispatch method, instead of the expected array.

DONE.
