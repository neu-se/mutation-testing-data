  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a callback that is used to resolve the promise, while `null` is not a function and will likely cause an error when used as a callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a callback that is used to resolve the promise, while `undefined` is not a function and will likely cause an error when used as a callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a callback that is used to resolve the promise, while `() => {}` is an empty function that will not resolve the promise.

DONE.
