  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is being applied to `a` instead of `a * a`, which would change the result of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is being applied to `a` instead of `a * a`, which would change the result of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is being applied to `a` instead of `a * a`, which would change the result of the expression.

DONE.
