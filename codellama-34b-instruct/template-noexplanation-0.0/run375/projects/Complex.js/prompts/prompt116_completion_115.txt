  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This will cause the `parse` function to always return the value of `a`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This will cause the `parse` function to always return the value of `b`, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This will cause the `parse` function to always return the sum of `a` and `b`, regardless of the input.

DONE.
