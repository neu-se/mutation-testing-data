  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#NONE#'
```
This would result in a different behavior because '#NONE#' is a different value than the original '#' and can cause the regular expression to match a different part of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#$$$#'
```
This would result in a different behavior because '#$$$#' is a different value than the original '#' and can cause the regular expression to match a different part of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#__TXN_ID__#'
```
This would result in a different behavior because '#__TXN_ID__#' is a different value than the original '#' and can cause the regular expression to match a different part of the string.

DONE.
