  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 'foo';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the string 'foo' instead of the original value of `arg`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a null value instead of the original value of `arg`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert an undefined value instead of the original value of `arg`.

DONE.
