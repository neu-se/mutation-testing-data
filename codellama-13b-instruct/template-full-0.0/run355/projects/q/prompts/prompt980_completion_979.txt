  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new NodeResolver object and passes it to the `fapply` method, while the buggy code fragment does not create a new NodeResolver object and instead passes `undefined` to the `fapply` method. This could cause the `fapply` method to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new NodeResolver object and passes it to the `fapply` method, while the buggy code fragment does not create a new NodeResolver object and instead passes `undefined` to the `fapply` method.
