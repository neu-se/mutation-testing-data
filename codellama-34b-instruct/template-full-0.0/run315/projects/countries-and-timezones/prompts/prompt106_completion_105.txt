  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `country === null` checks if it is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `country !== null` checks if it is strictly not equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `country === undefined` checks if it is strictly equal to `undefined`.

DONE.
