  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `!line` check would cause the line to be excluded from the filtered stack trace, even if it is not an internal or Node frame.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line !== ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line !== ""` check would cause the line to be excluded from the filtered stack trace, even if it is not an internal or Node frame and is not an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line.indexOf(" ") === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line.indexOf(" ") === -1` check would cause the line to be excluded from the filtered stack trace, even if it is not
