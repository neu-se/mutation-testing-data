  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `self` is an object, while `self + 1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `self` is an object, while `self.length` is a number representing the length of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `self` is an object, while `self.toString()` is a string representing the object.

DONE.
