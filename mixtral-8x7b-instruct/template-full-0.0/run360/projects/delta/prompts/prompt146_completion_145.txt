 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` only returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, causing an infinite loop in the `compose()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always retrieves the next operation with a fixed length of 1, potentially causing incorrect composition of operations and unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10))
```
This would result in different behavior because it randomly selects a length between 0 and 9 for the next operation, causing inconsistent behavior in the `compose()` method and potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
