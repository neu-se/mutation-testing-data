  Sure, I'd be happy to help!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression tells JavaScript to perform a global search and replace, rather than just replacing the first occurrence. This could potentially change the behavior of the `stripBom` function in unintended ways, depending on the input it is given.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF\s*/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now includes a whitespace character at the end, which was not present in the original code. This could potentially cause the `stripBom` function to remove more or fewer bytes from the input than it was intended to, depending on the circumstances.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\uFEFF/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now only matches a single occurrence of the BOM character, rather than all
