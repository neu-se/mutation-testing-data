  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `point` to be an object with properties `type` and `coordinates`, but the new code would convert the string `"foo"` to an object with only a `toString` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `point` to be an object with properties `type` and `coordinates`, but the new code would convert the boolean `true` to an object with only a `toString` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `point` to be an object with properties `type` and `coordinates`, but the new code would convert the null value to a plain object with no properties.

DONE.
