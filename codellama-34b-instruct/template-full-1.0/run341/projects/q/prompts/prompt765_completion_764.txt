  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var x = 5;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expected a promise object, but this change would pass a variable x with the value 5 instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{foo: 'bar'}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expected a promise object, but this change would pass an object with a property named foo and a value of 'bar' instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expected a promise object, but this change would pass a function that takes two arguments (a and b) and returns their sum instead.

DONE.
