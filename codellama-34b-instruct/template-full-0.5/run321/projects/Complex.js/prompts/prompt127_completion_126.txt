  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when called with any non-zero complex number, even if the result of the addition would be a finite complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when called with any non-zero complex number, even if the result of the addition would be a finite complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when called with any
