  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getPlaceholder
```
This would result in different behavior because "getPlaceholder" is a function that doesn't exist in the code. The code would throw an error because it wouldn't find any implementation for "getPlaceholder".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because "getTimezone" is a function that takes one argument "name", but in the original code, "getTimezone" was called without any argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezones
```
This would result in different behavior because "getTimezones" is a function that takes one argument "options", but in the original code, "getTimezones" was called without any argument.

DONE.
