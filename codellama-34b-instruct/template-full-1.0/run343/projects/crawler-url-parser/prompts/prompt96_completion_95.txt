  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in a syntax error, as the parentheses are not balanced and the expression is now unterminated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + (<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in a different calculation, as the `1 +` operator would be applied to the result of the replaced code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log((<PLACEHOLDER>))
```
This would result in different behavior, as the result of the replaced code fragment would be logged to the console instead of being returned as the result of the `extract` function.

DONE.
