  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and calling it would execute the function, whereas the original code fragment only evaluates the function reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that allows you to call a function with a specific `this` value, whereas the original code fragment does not specify a `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that allows you to call a function with a specific `this` value and an array of arguments, whereas the original code fragment does not specify a `this` value or any arguments.

DONE.
