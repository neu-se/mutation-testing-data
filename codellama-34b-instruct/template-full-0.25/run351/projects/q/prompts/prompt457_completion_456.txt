  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which would not be affected by the `splice()` method called later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array with the elements of the argument array, which would not be affected by the `splice()` method called later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.filter(function(rejection) { return rejection !== promise; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` creates a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, which would not be affected by the `splice()` method called later in the code.

DONE.
