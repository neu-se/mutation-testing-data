Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` calculates the cube root instead of the square root, leading to incorrect results for the square root calculation of complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly computes the square root of the sum of the real and imaginary parts instead of the magnitude of the complex number, which is not the intended calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the magnitude `r` directly instead of the expression `2.0 * (r + a)`, which alters the calculation of the real part of the square root of the complex number.

DONE.
