  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y).join
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(y)` is a different promise than `Q(x)`, and the `join` method would be called on a different promise, potentially leading to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which in this case is the original value of `x`. This could potentially lead to a different outcome if the callback function is not returning the correct value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(function(value) { return value + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which in this case is the original value of `x` plus
