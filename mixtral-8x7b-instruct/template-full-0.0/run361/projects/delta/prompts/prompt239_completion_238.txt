 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `opLength` in the `diff.DELETE` case to be double the actual length of the operation, potentially causing the deletion of more content than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent any deletions from taking place, as the `opLength` would always be 0, effectively skipping over the deletion process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `opLength` in the `diff.DELETE` case to be one more than the actual length of the operation, potentially causing the deletion of additional content or causing the function to behave unexpectedly when reaching the end of the operations.

DONE.
