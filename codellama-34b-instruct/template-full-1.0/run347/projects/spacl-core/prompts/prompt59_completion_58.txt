  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g, '\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character that is not a dot or a dollar sign, instead of just a dot.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([$])/g, '\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any dollar sign, but not any other character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.*$])/g, '\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a dot or a dollar sign anywhere in the string, instead of just at the beginning.

DONE.
