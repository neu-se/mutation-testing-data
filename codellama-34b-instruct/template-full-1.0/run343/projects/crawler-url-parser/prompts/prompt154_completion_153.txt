  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^/]*\/?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match a path that ends with a directory, whereas the original regular expression would match such a path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^/]*\/?[^/]$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match a path that ends with a file, whereas the original regular expression would match such a path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^/]*\/?[^/(]%$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a path that ends with a file followed by a '%' character, whereas the original regular expression would not match such a path.

DONE.
