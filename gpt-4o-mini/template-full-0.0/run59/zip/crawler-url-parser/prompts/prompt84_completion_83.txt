Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the text to uppercase, which changes the original casing of the text and may affect how it is compared or displayed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the HTML content of the element instead of the text content, potentially including HTML tags and affecting the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().slice(0, 5)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only takes the first five characters of the text, which may lead to incomplete or truncated information being stored.

DONE.
