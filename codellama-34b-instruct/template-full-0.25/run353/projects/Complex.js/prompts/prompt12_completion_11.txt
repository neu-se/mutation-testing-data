  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the unary minus operator, which negates the value of `x`, while the replacement code fragment is using the binary minus operator, which subtracts `x` from the value of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the unary minus operator, which negates the value of `x`, while the replacement code fragment is using the binary minus operator, which subtracts `x` from the value of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the unary minus operator, which negates the value of `x`, while the replacement code fragment is using the binary minus operator, which subtracts `x` from the value of `x`.

DONE.
