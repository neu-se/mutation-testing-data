  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `flush` function immediately, rather than waiting for the `setImmediate` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delay the `flush` function by 1 second, rather than calling it immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `flush` function after a delay of 1 second, rather than immediately.

DONE.
