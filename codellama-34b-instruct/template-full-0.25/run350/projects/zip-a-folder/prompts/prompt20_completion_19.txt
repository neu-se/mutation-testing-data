  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'a' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'a'` instead of `'w'`, which would cause the file to be appended to instead of overwritten.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { encoding: 'utf16le' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is set to `'utf16le'` instead of `'utf8'`, which would cause the file to be written in a different encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { fd: 1 });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fd` option is set to `1` instead of `undefined`, which would cause the file to be written to a different file descriptor.

DONE.
