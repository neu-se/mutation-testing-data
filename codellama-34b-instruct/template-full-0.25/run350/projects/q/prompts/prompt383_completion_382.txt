  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `callback` returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a fulfilled promise, whereas `callback` returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` returns a deferred promise, whereas `callback` returns a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
