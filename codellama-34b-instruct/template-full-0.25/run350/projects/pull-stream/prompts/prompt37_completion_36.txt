  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would access the fourth element of the `ref` array, rather than the third element as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would access the first element of the `ref` array, rather than the third element as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would access the length of the `ref` array, rather than the third element as in the original code.

DONE.
