  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rule
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rule` would return a single `Rule` object, while `this.rules` returns an array of `Rule` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rules.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `this.rules` except for the first element, while `this.rules` returns the original array unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.name === 'name')
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rules.filter(rule => rule.name === 'name')` would return a new array containing only the elements of `this.rules` where the `name` property is equal to `'name'`, while `this.rules` returns the original array unchanged.

DONE.
