Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.concat("\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array instead of joining the elements into a single string, which would lead to an incorrect format for the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.reverse().join("\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because reversing the order of the stack traces would change the context in which the errors occurred, potentially making debugging more difficult.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join(", " + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + ", ")
```
This would result in different behavior because using a comma instead of a newline would create a single line output for the stack traces, making it harder to read and interpret the stack trace information.

DONE.
