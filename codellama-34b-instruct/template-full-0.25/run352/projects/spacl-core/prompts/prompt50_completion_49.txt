  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a substring starting from the second character of `part`, rather than the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a substring starting from the second character of `part`, rather than the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a substring starting from the second character of `part`, rather than the first character.

DONE.
