  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, 1)
```
This code fragment will return the first character of the `part` string, which is not the same as the original code fragment `part` which returns the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.length
```
This code fragment will return the length of the `part` string, which is not the same as the original code fragment `part` which returns the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split('')
```
This code fragment will return an array of characters in the `part` string, which is not the same as the original code fragment `part` which returns the entire string.

DONE.
