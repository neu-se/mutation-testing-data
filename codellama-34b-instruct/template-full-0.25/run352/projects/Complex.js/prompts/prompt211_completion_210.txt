  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was swapping the values of `a` and `b`, but this replacement code fragment does not swap the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b, a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the values of `a` and `b` as they were, but this replacement code fragment is adding and subtracting them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the values of `a` and `b` as they were, but this replacement code fragment is swapping the values.

DONE.
