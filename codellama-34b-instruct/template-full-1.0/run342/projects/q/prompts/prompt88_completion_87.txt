  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create` creates a new object with the specified prototype object, whereas `arguments` is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[...arguments]` converts the `arguments` object into an array, whereas `Object.create(arguments)` creates a new object with the same properties as the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` creates a new empty object, whereas `Object.create(arguments)` creates a new object with the same properties as the `arguments` object.

DONE.
