  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```i <= tokens.length```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an additional iteration of the loop, which might lead to an out of bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```i === 0```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the loop to run a single time, regardless of the length of the `tokens` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```i < tokens.length / 2```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to only consider half of the `tokens` array, potentially missing important information.

DONE.
