```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` is an array, and `reportedUnhandledRejections.length` would return the length of the array, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` is an array, and `reportedUnhandledRejections.pop()` would remove and return the last element of the array, which is not the same as the
