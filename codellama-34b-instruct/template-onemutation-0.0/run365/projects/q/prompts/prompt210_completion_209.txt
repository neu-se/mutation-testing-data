  
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses an empty array, which would not have the same behavior as the original code fragment.
