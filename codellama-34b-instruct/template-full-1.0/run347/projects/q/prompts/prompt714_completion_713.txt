  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().reject()` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

DONE.
