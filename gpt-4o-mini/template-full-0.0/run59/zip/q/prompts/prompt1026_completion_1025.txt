Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the `Q` function instead of the original `object`, potentially causing a runtime error or unexpected behavior when trying to call methods on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` to the `Q` function instead of the original `object`, which may lead to similar issues as passing `null`, such as attempting to access properties or methods on `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string literal to the `Q` function instead of the original `object`, which would likely cause the method calls to fail since strings do not have the expected methods that the `Q` function would try to invoke.

DONE.
