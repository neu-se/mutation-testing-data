 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"nonexistentKey"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would not find the "nonexistentKey" property in the Promise object and would not execute the corresponding method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return "keys"; }
