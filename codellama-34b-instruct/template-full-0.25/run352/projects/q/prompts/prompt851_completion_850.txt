  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error object, rather than rejecting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise with the error object, rather than rejecting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would not reject the promise, and the error would not be handled.

DONE.
