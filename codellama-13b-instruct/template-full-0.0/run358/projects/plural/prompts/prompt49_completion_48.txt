  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate the `s` character to the end of the word, while this code fragment uses the `es` string literal instead. This would result in the plural form of words ending in `o` being changed to `oes` instead of `os`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate the `s` character to the end of the word, while this code fragment uses the `s` string literal instead. This would result in the plural form of words ending in `o` being changed to `os` instead of `oes`.
