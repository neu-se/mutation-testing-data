  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to check if `result[country]` is falsy, while this replacement code fragment uses the `===` operator to check if `result[country]` is strictly equal to `undefined`. If `result[country]` is any other falsy value (such as `null` or an empty string), the original code fragment would evaluate to `true`, while this replacement code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to check if `result[country]` is falsy, while this replacement code fragment uses the `!==` operator to check if `result[country]` is strictly not equal to `undefined`. If `result[country]` is any other falsy value (such as `null` or an empty string), the original code fragment would evaluate to `true`,
