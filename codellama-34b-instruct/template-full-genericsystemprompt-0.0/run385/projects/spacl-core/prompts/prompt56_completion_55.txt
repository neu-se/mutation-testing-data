  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
