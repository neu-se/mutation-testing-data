  Option 1: The buggy code fragment could be:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `isPromise` method, causing the promise to be rejected when it should have been resolved.

Option 2: The buggy code fragment could be:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is not a real method, and the error would be thrown when attempting to call it.

Option 3: The buggy code fragment could be:
```
isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` method would be called again, causing infinite recursion.

DONE.
