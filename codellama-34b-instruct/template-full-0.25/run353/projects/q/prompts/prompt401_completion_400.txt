  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to the first argument, which in this case is `this`. This means that the new function will always be called with `this` set to the promise, regardless of how it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the function with the `this` context set to `null`. This means that any references to `this` within the function will be `null`, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function with the `this` context set to `this`, and the arguments passed to the function will be the arguments passed to `apply`. This means that the function will be
