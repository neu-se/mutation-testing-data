Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places = Math.pow(10, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `places` to 0.1 instead of using the provided `places` argument or defaulting to 0, which would affect the precision of the ceiling operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places = Math.pow(10, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `places` to 10 instead of using the provided `places` argument or defaulting to 0, which would lead to rounding to the nearest ten instead of the intended precision.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places = Math.pow(10, places + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the `places` value by 1, effectively changing the precision of the ceiling operation to a higher order of magnitude than intended.

DONE.
