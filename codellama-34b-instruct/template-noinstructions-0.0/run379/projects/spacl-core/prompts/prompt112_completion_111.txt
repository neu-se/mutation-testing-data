  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would iterate over the `verbs` array, but the original code fragment used the `for...in` loop to iterate over the properties of the `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb in verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would iterate over the properties of the `verbs` object, but the original code fragment used the `for...of` loop to iterate over the `verbs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.keys(verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object, but the original code fragment used the `for...in` loop to iterate over the properties of the `verbs`
