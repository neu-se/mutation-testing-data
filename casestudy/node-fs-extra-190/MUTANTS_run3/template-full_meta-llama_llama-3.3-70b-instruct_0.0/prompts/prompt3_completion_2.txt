Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
srcFile
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the source file exists instead of the destination file, potentially leading to incorrect handling of file existence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/non/existent/path'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always check for the existence of a non-existent file, potentially leading to incorrect handling of file existence and clobbering behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destFile + '.tmp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check for the existence of a temporary file instead of the actual destination file, potentially leading to incorrect handling of file existence and clobbering behavior.

DONE.
