  Option 1:
===========================

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```

This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally call the callback with a value of `true`, regardless of whether the data passed the test or not. In the original code, the callback will only be called with `true` if `last` is `true` and `ended` is `false`, otherwise it will be called with `null`.

Option 2:
=============

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```

This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally call the callback with a value of `null` and the data, regardless of whether the data passed the test or not. In the original code, the callback will only be called with `null` if `last` is `true` and `ended` is `false`, otherwise it will be called with the data.

Option 3:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(if(ended
