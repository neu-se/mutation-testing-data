  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Empty lines may appear in a corrupted database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be more specific and provide more context to the developer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Invalid row data found in database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be more specific and provide more context to the developer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Database is corrupted')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be more specific and provide more context to the developer.

DONE.
