  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `a`. This change would cause the `acosh` function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `a`, and the `acosh` function would return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a * b` is an expression that multiplies the value of `a` by the value of `b`. This change would cause the `acosh` function to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
