  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert === newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to always overwrite the `insert` value of the previous operation, rather than only overwriting it if the types match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert != null && lastOp.insert == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to always add a new operation with a null `insert` value, rather than only adding it if the previous operation had a null `insert` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert != null && lastOp.insert != null && newOp.insert.length === lastOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to always add a new operation with a different `insert` value, rather than only adding it if the length of the previous operation's insert value matches the new
