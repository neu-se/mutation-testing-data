  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not create a new Q global, but rather assign the existing global.Q to a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q.noConflict();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not create a new Q global, but rather assign the existing global.Q to a variable, and also call the noConflict() method on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q.noConflict(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not only assign the existing global.Q to a variable, but also call the noConflict() method on it with the argument `true`, which would cause the method to return the previous value of global.Q.

DONE.
