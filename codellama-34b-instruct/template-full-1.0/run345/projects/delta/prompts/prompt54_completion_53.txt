  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops == null` would always evaluate to `false`, even if `ops` is `undefined` or `null`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Array.isArray(ops)` would always evaluate to `true`, even if `ops` is actually an array, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ops !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof ops !== 'object'` would always evaluate to `true`, even if `ops` is an array or object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
