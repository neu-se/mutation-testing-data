  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not be called, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be called instead of the callback function, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('Test error') }
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of the callback function being called, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
