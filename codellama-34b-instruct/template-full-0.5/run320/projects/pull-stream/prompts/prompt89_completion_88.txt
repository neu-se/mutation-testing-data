  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && id
```
This would result in different behavior because `test && id` is a different expression than `test`, and it would cause the `test` function to be called with the result of `id` instead of the original argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || id
```
This would result in different behavior because `test || id` is a different expression than `test`, and it would cause the `test` function to be called with the result of `id` if `test` returns a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== id
```
This would result in different behavior because `test !== id` is a different expression than `test`, and it would cause the `test` function to be called with the result of `id` if `test` returns a value that is not equal to `id`.

DONE.
