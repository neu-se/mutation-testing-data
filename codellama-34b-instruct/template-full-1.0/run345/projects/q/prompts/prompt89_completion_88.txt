  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because f and arguments are distinct objects and swapping their positions would cause the function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, f
```
This would result in different behavior because arguments is a special object of JavaScript that is a local variable available in every function and passing it as the first argument to f would cause it to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, f
```
This would result in different behavior because null is an object and passing it as the first argument to f would cause it to fail.

DONE.
