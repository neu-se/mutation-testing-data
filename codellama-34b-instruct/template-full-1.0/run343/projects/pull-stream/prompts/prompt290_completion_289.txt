  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `field + 1` is not the same as `field`, and would result in a different value being passed to the `unique` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `field * 2` is not the same as `field`, and would result in a different value being passed to the `unique` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `field - 1` is not the same as `field`, and would result in a different value being passed to the `unique` function.

DONE.
