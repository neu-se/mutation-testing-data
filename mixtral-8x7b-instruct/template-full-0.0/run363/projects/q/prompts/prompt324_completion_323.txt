 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback` is a function reference, and directly calling it would not pass the arguments `(op, args)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fallback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback.apply` expects arguments, but they are not provided in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fallback.call(null, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the `fallback` function to `null`, which might not be the intended context.

DONE.
