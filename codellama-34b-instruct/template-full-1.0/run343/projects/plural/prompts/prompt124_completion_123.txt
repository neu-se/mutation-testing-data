  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
function(w) { return w + w }
```

This would result in different behavior because the function would now append the word twice instead of only once, which would break the pluralization of words with the "uncountable" category.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
function(w) { return w - 1 }
```

This would result in different behavior because the function would now subtract 1 from the word instead of only appending "s", which would break the pluralization of words with the "uncountable" category.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
function(w) { return w + "s" + w }
```

This would result in different behavior because the function would now append "s" to the word twice instead of only once, which would break the pluralization of words with the "uncountable" category.

DONE.
