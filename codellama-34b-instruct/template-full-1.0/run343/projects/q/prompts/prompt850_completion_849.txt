  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `error` is not truthy, while this replacement checks whether `error` is truthy. In other words, this replacement would cause the `deferred.reject` call to be executed more frequently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error || typeof error !== "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `error` is a string, while this replacement checks whether `error` is not a string. In other words, this replacement would cause the `deferred.reject` call to be executed less frequently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(error && typeof error === "string")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `error` is a string and whether it is truthy, while this replacement checks whether `error` is not a string or not truthy. In other words, this
