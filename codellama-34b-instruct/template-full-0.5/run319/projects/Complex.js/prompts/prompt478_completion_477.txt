  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is `NaN`, while `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, so `!isFinite` would return `true` if `isFinite` returns `false`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is a finite number, while the original code fragment checks if the real part is a finite number.

DONE.
