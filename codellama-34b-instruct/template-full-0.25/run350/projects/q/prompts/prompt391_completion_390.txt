  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise, while `progressed` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfilled` is a function that returns a resolved promise, while `progressed` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this function returns the input value, while `progressed` and `fulfilled` return resolved or rejected promises.

DONE.
