  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not a function and would throw an error when called as one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a different object from `promise` and does not have the same methods or properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is not the same object as `promise` and may have different properties or methods.

DONE.
