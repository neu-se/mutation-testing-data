  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would close the write stream before the read stream, which could cause data loss or corruption.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._readStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would close the read stream before the write stream, which could cause data loss or corruption.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._readStream, this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would close both the read and write streams simultaneously, which could cause data loss or corruption.

DONE.
