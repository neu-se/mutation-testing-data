  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `===` operator instead of `==`. This can cause the code to behave differently if `end` is a truthy value that is not `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end, cb || function () {})
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it adds an additional argument to the `done` function call. This can cause the code to behave differently if `cb` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end, cb || function () {}, abort || true)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it adds an additional argument to the `done` function call. This can cause the code to behave differently if `abort` is not a truthy value.
