Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current operation in `thisIter` is a 'delete' instead of checking if the current operation in `otherIter` is an 'insert', which would lead to incorrect handling of the operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the code to proceed if the next operation in `otherIter` is not a 'delete', which could lead to incorrect merging of operations when a 'delete' operation is present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current operation in `otherIter` is a 'retain', which would change the logic of how operations are processed and could lead to unexpected results when retaining operations are involved.

DONE.
