  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].isPrototypeOf(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPrototypeOf` only checks if an object is on another object's prototype chain. In contrast, `test` is used to search for a pattern in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].toString().includes(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` returns a string representation of the regular expression object, rather than testing the pattern against the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].toUpperCase().includes(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `toUpperCase` on a regular expression object would return the uppercase version of the string representation of the object, rather than the uppercase version of the input string.

DONE.
