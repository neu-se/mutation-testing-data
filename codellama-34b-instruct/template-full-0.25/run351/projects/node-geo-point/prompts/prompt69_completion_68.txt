  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y, x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is incremented by 1, causing the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument is incremented by 1, causing the calculation to produce a different result.

DONE.
