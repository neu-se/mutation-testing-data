  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is spelled with an "e" at the end, while the new code fragment is spelled with an "i".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while the new code fragment is a concatenation of two strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies' * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while the new code fragment is a multiplication of a string and a number.

DONE.
