  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
read
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the `cb` function with the appropriate arguments, the function would return the `read` function itself, which is not correct behavior for a mutated test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
null
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the `cb` function with the appropriate arguments, the function would return `null`, which would cause the program to crash with a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the `cb` function with the appropriate arguments, the function would return a new function with no arguments, which would cause the program to continue running with no further action performed.

DONE.
