  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + 1)
```
This change will cause the `utcOffsetStr` property to be one hour ahead of the actual UTC offset, which may cause confusion and errors in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset * 2)
```
This change will cause the `utcOffsetStr` property to be twice the actual UTC offset, which may cause errors in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset - 1)
```
This change will cause the `utcOffsetStr` property to be one hour behind the actual UTC offset, which may cause confusion and errors in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
