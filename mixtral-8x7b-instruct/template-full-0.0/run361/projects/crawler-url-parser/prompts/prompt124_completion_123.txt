 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an iterator, not an array. The `Array.from()` method would not be able to convert it, and the final result would be an array of iterators instead of an array of objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an iterator of keys, not an array of objects. The final result would be an array of URL strings instead of an array of objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...urlMap.values()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array created from the spread operator. The spread operator may not be supported in older environments, causing the code to fail.

DONE.
