  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length = otherIter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable would be decremented by 1, which would cause the loop to terminate one iteration earlier.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length = otherIter.peekLength() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable would be incremented by 1, which would cause the loop to iterate one more time than it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length = otherIter.peekLength() * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable would be doubled, which would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times as it should.

DONE.
