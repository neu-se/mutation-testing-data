Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(input * Math.pow(10, precision)) / Math.pow(10, precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because this code rounds the number to the specified precision instead of truncating it, which can lead to different values being returned for the latitude and longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because this code converts the number to a string representation instead of returning a number, which would cause the `GeoPoint` constructor to receive string values instead of numeric values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(input * Math.pow(10, precision)) / Math.pow(10, precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because this code truncates the number down to the specified precision instead of rounding it, which can lead to a loss of information and different values being returned for the latitude and longitude.

DONE.
