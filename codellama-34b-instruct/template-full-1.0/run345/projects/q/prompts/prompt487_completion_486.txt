  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(atReport, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would not be properly updated, leading to incorrect tracking of handled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` parameter would not be properly included in the emitted event, leading to incorrect tracking of handled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because unhandled rejections would no longer be tracked, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in the event of an unhandled rejection.

DONE.
