  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `otherOp.delete` is a number and `thisOp.retain` is either a number or an object that is not null. The modified code fragment would check if `otherOp.delete` is a number and `thisOp.retain` is either a number or an object that is not null, regardless of the type of `thisOp.retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
