Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function onFulfilled() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` function is never called, meaning that the promise will not handle any rejection, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` function is incorrectly used as the rejection handler, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject when it encounters an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { deferred.reject(new Error("Promise rejected")); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it always rejects the promise with a generic error message regardless of the actual error that occurred, losing the context of the original rejection.

DONE.
