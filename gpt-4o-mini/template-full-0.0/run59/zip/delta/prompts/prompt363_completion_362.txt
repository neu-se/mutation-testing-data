Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate when `otherIter` has no more elements, effectively skipping any remaining operations in `thisIter`, which could lead to incomplete transformations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only continue the loop if both iterators have more elements, potentially ignoring remaining operations in `thisIter` if `otherIter` is exhausted, which could lead to incorrect transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the loop condition to only continue if the next operation in `thisIter` is a delete operation, which would prevent processing of insert operations and could lead to incorrect handling of the delta transformations.

DONE.
