  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` returns a string, whereas `null` is a null value and would cause the `writeFileSync` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` returns a string, whereas `undefined` is an undefined value and would cause the `writeFileSync` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` returns a string, whereas `0` is a number value and would cause the `writeFileSync` method to fail.

DONE.
