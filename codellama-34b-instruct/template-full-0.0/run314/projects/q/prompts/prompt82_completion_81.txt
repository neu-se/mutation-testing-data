  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick.runAfter` method would not be able to access the `task` variable, leading to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick.runAfter` method would not be able to access the `task` variable, leading to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick.runAfter` method would not be able to access the `task` variable, leading to an error.

DONE.
