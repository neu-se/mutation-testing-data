  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `name` parameter, and it would cause the `query` method to return `null` instead of the expected `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `name` parameter, and it would cause the `query` method to return `null` instead of the expected `true` or `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not a valid value for the `name` parameter, and it would cause the `query` method to return `null` instead of the expected `true` or `false`.

DONE.
