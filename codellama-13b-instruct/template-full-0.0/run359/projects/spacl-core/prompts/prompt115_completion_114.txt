  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `verbs` object is not the same as the `verbs` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method of the `verbs` object is not the same as the `verbs` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf()` method of the `verbs` object is not the same as the `verbs` object itself.

DONE.
