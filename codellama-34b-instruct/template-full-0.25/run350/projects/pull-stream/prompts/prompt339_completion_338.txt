  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being incremented by 1, which would cause the `seen` object to be populated with different keys, potentially leading to false positives or false negatives in the `filter` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being decremented by 1, which would cause the `seen` object to be populated with different keys, potentially leading to false positives or false negatives in the `filter` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being multiplied by 2, which would cause the `seen` object to be populated with different keys, potentially leading to false positives or false negatives in the `filter` function.

DONE.
