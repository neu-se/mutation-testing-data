  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.match` returns a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, while `path.search` returns the index of the match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.match` returns the matched substring, while `path.slice` returns a subset of characters from the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.match` returns the matched substring, while `path.split` returns an array of substrings split at the matched substring.

DONE.
