  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrl && currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the ! operator negates the truthiness of the currentUrl variable, meaning that the code would not enter the conditional block even if the URL is valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.href && currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the href property is used instead of the url property, which could cause issues if the URL is not properly formatted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.subdomain && currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because a different property than url is being checked for truthiness. If the subdomain property is not empty but the URL is not valid, the code would still enter the conditional block.

DONE.
