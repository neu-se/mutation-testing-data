Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(newOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to push the `retain` property of `newOp` instead of the entire `newOp` object, which could lead to incorrect operations being added to the `delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push({ ...newOp, insert: null });
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies `newOp` by setting the `insert` property to `null`, which could change the intended operation from an insert to a no-op, potentially altering the final result of the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(newOp.delete);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the `delete` property of `newOp`, which may not exist or be relevant, leading to unexpected behavior in the `delta` operations and potentially causing errors or incorrect results.

DONE.
