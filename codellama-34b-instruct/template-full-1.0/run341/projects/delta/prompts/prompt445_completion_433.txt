  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because if the current index is 0, the original code would return the first element in the array, while the modified code would return the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because if the current index is the last element in the array, the original code would return the last element, while the modified code would return beyond the array bounds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index = 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code would always return the first element in the array, regardless of the current index.

DONE.
