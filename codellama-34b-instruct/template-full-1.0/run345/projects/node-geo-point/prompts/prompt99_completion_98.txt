  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments of atan2 are reversed, causing the result of the calculation to be wrong.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y, x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of atan2 is incremented by one, causing the result of the calculation to be approximately one degree different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y, x - y
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments of atan2 are changed to be the sum and difference of x and y, causing the result of the calculation to be completely different from the original.

DONE.
