  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection` object is not defined in the code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(rejection)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection` object is not defined in the code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection` object is not defined in the code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
