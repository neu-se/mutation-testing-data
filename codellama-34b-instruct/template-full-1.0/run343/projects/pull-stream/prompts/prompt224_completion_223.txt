  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the boolean value of `test`, so if `test` is `true`, it would become `false`, and if `test` is `false`, it would become `true`. This would change the behavior of the `filterNot` function, which is expected to return all elements that do not match the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would check for strict equality, so if `test` is not a boolean value, it would always return `false`. This would change the behavior of the `filterNot` function, which is expected to return all elements that do not match the test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of `test` unchanged, which is not the expected behavior of the `filterNot` function.
