Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the error object would mean that the error handling logic would not receive any error information, potentially leading to unhandled errors or misleading success states.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'An error occurred'
```
This would result in different behavior because using a string instead of the error object would not provide the necessary error details, which could lead to a failure in properly logging or handling the specific error that occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Write failed')
```
This would result in different behavior because creating a new error with a generic message would obscure the original error information, making it difficult to diagnose the actual issue that caused the write operation to fail.

DONE.
