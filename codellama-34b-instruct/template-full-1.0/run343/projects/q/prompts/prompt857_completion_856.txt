  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId-4;
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` is a function and `timeoutId-4` would be a syntax error. This would cause the code to fail and the test case would not pass.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId--;
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeoutId--` would decrement the `timeoutId` variable by 1, potentially causing the timer to be cleared prematurely. This could cause the test case to fail if the timer should not have been cleared yet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId+4;
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeoutId+4` would increase the `timeoutId` variable by 4, potentially causing the timer to never be cleared. This could cause the test case to fail if the timer should have been cleared after the given timeout.

DONE.
