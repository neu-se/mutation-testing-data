 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the `i` variable by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to skip every other argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--i
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the `i` variable, causing the loop to iterate backwards and potentially process the arguments in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete arguments[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it deletes the `i`-th argument from the `arguments` object, causing the loop to skip some arguments and potentially process the remaining arguments in the wrong order.

DONE.
