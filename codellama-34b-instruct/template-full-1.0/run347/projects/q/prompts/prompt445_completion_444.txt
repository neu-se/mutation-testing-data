  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the original promise as the third argument, which would be handled by the promise library, it would pass undefined, which would not be handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, throw reason
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the original promise as the third argument, which would be handled by the promise library, it would pass the error as the third argument, which would be handled by the JavaScript runtime, resulting in a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", undefined, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the reason as the second argument, which would be handled by the promise library, it would pass undefined, which would not be handled.

DONE.
