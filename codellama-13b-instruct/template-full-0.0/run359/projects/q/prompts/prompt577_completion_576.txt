  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "next" operator is used to iterate over the values of an array, whereas the original code uses the "send" operator to send a value to the generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "throw" operator is used to throw an exception, whereas the original code uses the "send" operator to send a value to the generator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "return" operator is used to return a value from a function, whereas the original code uses the "send" operator to send a value to the generator.

DONE.
