Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes == null || typeof attributes !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `newOp` to be created without attributes even when a valid object is provided, effectively ignoring the attributes parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null && typeof attributes === 'object' && Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `newOp` to be created with attributes only if the attributes object is empty, which contradicts the original intent of including non-empty attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null && typeof attributes === 'object' && Object.keys(attributes).length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition will always evaluate to false (since the number of keys cannot be negative), preventing any attributes from being assigned to `newOp` regardless of the actual attributes provided.

DONE.
