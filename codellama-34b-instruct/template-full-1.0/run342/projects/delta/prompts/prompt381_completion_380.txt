  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` would return the next operation in the `otherIter` iterator, without advancing the iterator, whereas `otherIter.next()` would return the next operation and advance the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength() - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength() - 1)` would return the next operation in the `otherIter` iterator, but would advance the iterator by one less than the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` would return the type of the next operation in the `otherIter` iterator, without advancing the iterator, whereas `otherIter.next()` would return the next operation and
