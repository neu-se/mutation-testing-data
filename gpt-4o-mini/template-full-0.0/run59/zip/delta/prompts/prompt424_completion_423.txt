Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset > index || priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the offset is greater than the index or if priority is true, which could lead to incorrect index adjustments when processing insert operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'insert' && (offset < index && !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the condition for insert operations, causing the code to incorrectly handle cases where inserts should be processed, potentially skipping necessary updates to the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'delete' && (offset < index || priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks for delete operations instead of insert operations, which would lead to improper index calculations when encountering delete operations, affecting the overall transformation logic.

DONE.
