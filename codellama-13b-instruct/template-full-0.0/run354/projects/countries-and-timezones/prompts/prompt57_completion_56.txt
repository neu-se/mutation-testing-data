  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `countries` object has a property with the key `id`, while the new code fragment checks if the `countries` object has a property with the key `id` and the value `true`. This would result in different behavior if the `countries` object has a property with the key `id` and the value `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `countries` object has a property with the key `id`, while the new code fragment checks if the `countries` object does not have a property with the key `id`. This would result in different behavior if the `countries` object has a property with the key `id`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior
