  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
never
```
This would result in different behavior because `never` is a function that always returns `false`, whereas `once` is a function that returns `true` only once and then returns `false` for subsequent calls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
twice
```
This would result in different behavior because `twice` is a function that returns `true` twice and then returns `false` for subsequent calls, whereas `once` is a function that returns `true` only once and then returns `false` for subsequent calls.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
always
```
This would result in different behavior because `always` is a function that always returns `true`, whereas `once` is a function that returns `true` only once and then returns `false` for subsequent calls.

DONE.
