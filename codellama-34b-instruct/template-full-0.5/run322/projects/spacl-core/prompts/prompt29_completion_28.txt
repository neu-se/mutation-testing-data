  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.reverse()` would reverse the order of the parts, while `parts.reduce()` would combine the parts using the provided function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.pop()` would remove the last part from the array, while `parts.reduce()` would combine all the parts using the provided function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.shift()` would remove the first part from the array, while `parts.reduce()` would combine all the parts using the provided function.

DONE.
