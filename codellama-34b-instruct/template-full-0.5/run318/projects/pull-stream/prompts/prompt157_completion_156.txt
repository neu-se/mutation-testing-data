  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `_value` variable to the `cb` function, instead of the `null` value that the original code fragment passes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `_value` variable plus 1 to the `cb` function, instead of the `null` value that the original code fragment passes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `_value` variable multiplied by 2 to the `cb` function, instead of the `null` value that the original code fragment passes.

DONE.
