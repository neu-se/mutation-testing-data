 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `changeLength` method would no longer correctly subtract the `delete` property of the current element in the accumulator when iterating over the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `changeLength` method would incorrectly subtract 1 from the accumulator when iterating over the `ops` array, instead of the actual value of the `delete` property of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `changeLength` method would now introduce non-determinism by using a random value to subtract from the accumulator when iterating over the `ops` array. This could lead to unexpected results and make it harder to reason about the code.

DONE.
