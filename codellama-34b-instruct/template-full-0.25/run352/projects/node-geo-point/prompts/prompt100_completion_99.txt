  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but the `- 360` would subtract 360 degrees from the result, causing the bearing to be negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but the `+ 360` would add 360 degrees to the result, causing the bearing to be greater than 360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but the `* 2` would double the result, causing the bearing to be twice as large as it should be.
