  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved even if the original promise was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved even if the original promise was still pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "unknown"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved even if the original promise was in an unknown state.

DONE.
