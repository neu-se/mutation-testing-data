  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a given value, while `defer` is an object that contains the promise and related methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a given reason, while `defer` is an object that contains the promise and related methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.notify` is a function that sends a notification to the promise's progress listeners, while `defer` is an object that contains the promise and related methods.

DONE.
