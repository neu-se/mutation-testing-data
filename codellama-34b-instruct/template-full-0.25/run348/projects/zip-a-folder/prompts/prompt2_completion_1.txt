  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
await ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        gzip: true,
        gzipOptions: {
            level: o.compression,
        },
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzip` option is set to `true`, which would compress the archive using the gzip algorithm, whereas the original code fragment did not specify any compression algorithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
await ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        zlib: {
            level: o.compression,
        },
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zlib` option is set to an object with a `
