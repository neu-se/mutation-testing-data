  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.state` would be `undefined`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect()` is a function that returns an object with a `state` property, and `this.inspect().state` would be the actual state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().value
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect().value` would be the fulfilled value of the promise, and the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
