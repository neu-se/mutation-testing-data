  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value that indicates whether the function should be aborted, while `null` is a null value that will not cause the function to be aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value that indicates whether the function should be aborted, while `undefined` is a value that will not cause the function to be aborted, but will also not provide a value for the `abort` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value that indicates whether the function should be aborted, while `false` is a boolean value that will cause the function to be aborted.

DONE.
