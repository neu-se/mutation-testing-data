 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would receive an empty array as the second argument, instead of the arguments passed to the original function. This would cause the `array_slice` function to return an empty array, which would affect the further execution of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array-like object as the first argument. Passing `null` instead would result in an error being thrown, causing the code execution to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){return 42;}
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a function as the first argument to `array_slice` is not valid. This would result in an error being thrown, causing the code execution to fail.

DONE.
