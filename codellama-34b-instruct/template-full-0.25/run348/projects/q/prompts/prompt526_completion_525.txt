  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `dispatch` function, whereas the original code passes all arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all arguments except the first one to the `dispatch` function, whereas the original code passes all arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `args` array to the `dispatch` function, whereas the original code passes the array itself.

DONE.
