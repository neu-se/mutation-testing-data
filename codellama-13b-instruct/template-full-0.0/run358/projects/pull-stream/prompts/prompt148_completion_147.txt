  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.values` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array of the object's own property names, including non-enumerable properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertySymbols
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols` returns an array of the object's own property symbols, including non-enumerable properties.

DONE.
