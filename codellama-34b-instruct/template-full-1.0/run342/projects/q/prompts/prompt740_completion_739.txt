  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` returns a deferred object, but `Q.defer(null)` returns a promise that is rejected with the error object `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` returns a promise that is pending, but `Q.defer` returns a deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a resolved promise, but `Q.defer` returns a deferred object.

DONE.
