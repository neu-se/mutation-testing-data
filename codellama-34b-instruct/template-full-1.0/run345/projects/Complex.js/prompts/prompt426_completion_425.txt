  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
apow
```
This would result in different behavior because `apow` is a typo of `Math.pow` and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.power
```
This would result in different behavior because `power` is not a valid method of the `Math` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<your-name>
```
This would result in different behavior because `your-name` is not a valid mathematical operator and would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
