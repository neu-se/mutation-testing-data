  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater than operator, while the replacement code fragment uses the greater than or equal to operator. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases, such as when the `firstLeft` variable is equal to zero.

DONE.
