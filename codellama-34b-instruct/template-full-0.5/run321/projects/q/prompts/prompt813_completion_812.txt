  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return callback.fcall(value).then(function () {
        return value;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` function with the `value` argument, which is not the same as calling it with no arguments as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return callback.fcall().then(function () {
        throw reason;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` function with no arguments, which is not the same as calling it with the `reason` argument as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return callback.fcall(reason).then(function () {
        return value;
    });
});
```
