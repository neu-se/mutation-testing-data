 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `options.dest` is an empty string instead of checking if it's an absolute path. This could cause issues if the `options.dest` is an empty string, and the code might resolve the destination to an unexpected directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.win32.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for absolute paths only in the Windows operating system, while the original code checks for absolute paths in all operating systems. This could cause issues when running the code on non-Windows systems.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fs.existsSync(options.dest)
