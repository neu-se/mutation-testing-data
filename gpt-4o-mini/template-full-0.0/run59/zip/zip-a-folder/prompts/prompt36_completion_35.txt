Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(process.stdout);
```
This would result in different behavior because it redirects the output of the zip archive to the standard output stream instead of the intended file or custom write stream, which would cause the zip file not to be created as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because piping to `null` effectively discards the output, meaning that the zip archive would not be written anywhere, leading to a failure in creating the zip file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output);
output.on('finish', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the event listener from 'close' to 'finish', which may not be triggered in the same way, potentially causing the promise to resolve prematurely or not at all, leading to incorrect handling of the completion of the zipping process.

DONE.
