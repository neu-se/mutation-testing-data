  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the second argument would cause the `URL.parse` method to not parse the query string, which could result in different behavior if the query string contains important information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the third argument would cause the `URL.parse` method to not parse the fragment, which could result in different behavior if the fragment contains important information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value passed as the third argument would cause the `URL.parse` method to parse the fragment, which could result in different behavior if the fragment contains important information.

DONE.
