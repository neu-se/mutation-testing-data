 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/.$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the path ends with any character instead of checking if it ends with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/.+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the path contains at least one character instead of checking if the path ends with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(new RegExp('/$'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a regular expression literal instead of the match method, and checks if the path ends with a slash. However, it would not throw an error if the path does not end with a slash.

DONE.
