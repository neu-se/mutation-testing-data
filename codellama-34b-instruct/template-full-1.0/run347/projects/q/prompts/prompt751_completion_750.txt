  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is used to reject the promise, while the `deferred.notify` method is used to notify the progress of the promise. Using `deferred.notify` instead would result in the promise being resolved instead of rejected, which would change the behavior of the program.

```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is used to reject the promise, while the `de
