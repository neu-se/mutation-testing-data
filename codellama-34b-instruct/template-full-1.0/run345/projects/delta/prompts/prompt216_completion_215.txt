  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would skip the first two elements of the `other.ops` array, leading to unexpected results in the `concat` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would return only the last element of the `other.ops` array, leading to unexpected results in the `concat` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would return an empty array, leading to unexpected results in the `concat` method.

DONE.
