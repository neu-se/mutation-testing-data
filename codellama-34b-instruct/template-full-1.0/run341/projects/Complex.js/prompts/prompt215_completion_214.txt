  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because with the original code fragment, `a` and `b` are swapped, while with the modified code, `a` and `b` are added together.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because with the original code fragment, `a` and `b` are swapped, while with the modified code, `a` and `b` are subtracted from each other.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because with the original code fragment, `a` and `b` are swapped, while with the modified code, `b` is subtracted from `a`.

DONE.
