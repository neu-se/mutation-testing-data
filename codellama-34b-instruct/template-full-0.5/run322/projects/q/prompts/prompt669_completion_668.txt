  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply" and would not pass the same arguments to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" returns a new function with the bound arguments, whereas "apply" calls the function with the provided arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"applyAll"
```
This would result in different behavior because "applyAll" is not a valid method and would cause an error.

DONE.
