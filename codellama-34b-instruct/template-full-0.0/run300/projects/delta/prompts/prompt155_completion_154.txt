  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether there are more operations to iterate over, while `otherIter.hasNext()` is a function call that returns the result of the function, which is a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek` is a function that returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, while `otherIter.peek()` is a function call that returns the result of the function, which is the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` is a function that advances the iterator and returns the next operation, while `otherIter.next()` is a function call that returns the result of the function, which is the next operation.
