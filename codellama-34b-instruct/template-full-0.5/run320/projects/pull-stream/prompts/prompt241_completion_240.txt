  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a non-null value, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a defined value, while `undefined` is an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a truthy value, while `!data` is a falsy value.

DONE.
