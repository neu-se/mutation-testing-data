  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the attributes of the two operations are not the same object reference, even if they have the same properties and values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if the attributes of the two operations are not the same object reference, even if they have the same properties and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes && !isEqual(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the attributes of the two operations are not the same object reference and are not equal, even if they have the same properties and values.

DONE.
