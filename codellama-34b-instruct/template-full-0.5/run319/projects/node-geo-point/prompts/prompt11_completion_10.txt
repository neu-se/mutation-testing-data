  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinate'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to a different property of the `point` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only refer to the first element of the `coordinates` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only refer to the second element of the `coordinates` array, rather than the entire array.

DONE.
