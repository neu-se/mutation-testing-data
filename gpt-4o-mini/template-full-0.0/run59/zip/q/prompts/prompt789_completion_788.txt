Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the promise handling to use the `catch` method instead of `then`, which would only handle rejections and ignore fulfilled values, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the fulfillment handler to `null`, meaning that if the promise is fulfilled, it will not execute any fulfillment logic, which could lead to unexpected results if the promise resolves successfully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `rejected` callback as the fulfillment handler, which would cause the promise to execute the rejection logic when it is fulfilled, leading to incorrect promise resolution behavior.

DONE.
