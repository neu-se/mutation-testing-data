  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the newline character (`\n`) is used to indicate the end of a line, while the tab character (`\t`) is used to indicate a tabulation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the newline character (`\n`) is used to indicate the end of a line, while the space character (` `) is used to indicate a space.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the newline character (`\n`) is used to indicate the end of a line, while the backslash character (`\`) is used to escape special characters.

DONE.
