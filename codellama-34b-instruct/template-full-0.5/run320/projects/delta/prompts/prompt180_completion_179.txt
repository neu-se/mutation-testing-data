  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is always non-negative, so `length - 0` is always equal to `length`. This would cause the `while` loop to run indefinitely, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is always non-negative, so `length - 1` is always less than `length`. This would cause the `while` loop to run one fewer times than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is always non-negative, so `length + 1` is always greater than `length`. This would cause the `while` loop to run one more time than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
