  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `all` method to reject the resulting promise immediately, rather than waiting for all of the promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `all` method to reject the resulting promise immediately, rather than waiting for all of the promises to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("something")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, which would be caught by the `all` method and cause it to reject the resulting promise immediately, rather than waiting for all of the promises to settle.

DONE.
