 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be fulfilled with `undefined`, instead of using the original promise's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject('An error occurred')
