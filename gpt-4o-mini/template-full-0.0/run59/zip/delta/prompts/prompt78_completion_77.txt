Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'string' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `newOp.delete` is a string instead of a number, which would cause the condition to fail even if `lastOp.delete` is a valid number, leading to incorrect handling of the delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' ||
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical OR operator instead of AND, meaning that the condition would pass if either `newOp.delete` or `lastOp.delete` is a number, potentially allowing unintended operations to occur.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks `lastOp.insert` instead of `lastOp.delete`, which would lead to the condition passing or failing based on the type of `lastOp.insert`, potentially causing incorrect merging of operations
