  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isDefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` tests whether a value is a promise, whereas `isDefined` tests whether a value is defined. If the original code is buggy and the value is not a promise, the bug would persist. However, if the code is fixed, and the value is not defined, the incorrect behavior would be revealed and the test would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (isPromise(value)) {
    return value;
}
return Promise.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve(value)` would convert a non-promise value to a resolved promise, whereas `isPromise` would only check if the value is a promise or not. If the original code is buggy and the value is not a promise, the test would pass, but if the code is fixed, the incorrect behavior would be revealed and the test would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
