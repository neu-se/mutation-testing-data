  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would not be called if the promise is rejected, leading to a silent failure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would not be called if the promise is rejected, leading to a silent failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would not be called if the promise is rejected, leading to a silent failure.

DONE.
