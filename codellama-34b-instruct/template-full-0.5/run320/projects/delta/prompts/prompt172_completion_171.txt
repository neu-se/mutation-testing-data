  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation in the other iterator, rather than the current iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation in the this iterator, plus one, rather than the actual length of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation in the other iterator, plus one, rather than the actual length of the operation.

DONE.
