  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned `Complex['INFINITY']` if `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()` are both true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned `Complex['NAN']` if `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()` are both true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned `Complex['NAN']` if `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()` are both true.

DONE.
