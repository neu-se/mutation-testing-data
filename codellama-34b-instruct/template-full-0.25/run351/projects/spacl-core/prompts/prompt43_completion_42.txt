  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function is called with a different argument, which would cause the regular expression to be compiled differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parts.push` function is called with a different argument, which would cause the regular expression to be compiled differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `props.push` function is called with a different argument, which would cause the regular expression to be compiled differently.

DONE.
