  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the original array, which would cause the `nfbind` function to bind the callback to the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.shift()` would remove the first element of the array, which would cause the `nfbind` function to bind the callback to the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.pop()` would remove the last element of the array, which would cause the `nfbind` function to bind the callback to the wrong arguments.

DONE.
