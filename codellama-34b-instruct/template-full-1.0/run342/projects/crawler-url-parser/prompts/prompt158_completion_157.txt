  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/forum/playground
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the string "forum/playground" literally, instead of matching any character except for "/".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^\/]*\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a string that starts and ends with "/", but contains any number of characters other than "/".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^\/]*\/$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a string that starts and ends with "/", but contains any number of characters other than "/", and would also match multiple occurrences of this pattern in the input string.

DONE.
