Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the resolver to the beginning of the `nodeArgs` array instead of the end, which may lead to incorrect argument ordering when the callback is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a `null` value instead of the resolver, which would cause the callback to receive `null` as the last argument instead of the expected resolver function, potentially leading to unhandled errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `resolve` method instead of the `makeNodeResolver` method, which would not provide the correct callback signature expected by Node-style functions, leading to incorrect promise resolution.

DONE.
