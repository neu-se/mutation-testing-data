  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `index < 0` would evaluate to `false` if the index is positive, and `true` if it is negative or zero. This would cause the conditional statement to always evaluate to `false` and the `invert` method to always return an empty delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === index
```
This would result in different behavior because `length === index` would evaluate to `true` if the length of the current iteration is equal to the current index, and `false` otherwise. This would cause the conditional statement to evaluate to `true` only for the last iteration, which would result in the `invert` method returning a delta with a single insert operation at the last position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `index % 2 === 0` would evaluate to `true` if the index is
