  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console, whereas the original code fragment does not have any logging statements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, whereas the original code fragment does not have any error-throwing statements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "Hello, world!";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string, whereas the original code fragment does not have any return statements.

DONE.
