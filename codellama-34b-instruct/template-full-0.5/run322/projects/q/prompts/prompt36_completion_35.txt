  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeJS` variable is inverted, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeJS` variable is still truthy, but the `false` literal causes the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeJS` variable is still truthy, but the `true` literal causes the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
