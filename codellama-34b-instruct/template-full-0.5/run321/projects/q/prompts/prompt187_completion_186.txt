  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace("(", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace the first occurrence of "(" with an empty string, which would change the output of the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the string into an array of substrings, and the `[0]` index would select the first element of the array, which would change the output of the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would extract a substring from the original string, starting at the second character, which would change the output of the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function.

DONE.
