  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is the logical NOT operator, which inverts the truthiness of the `cb` variable. If `cb` is truthy, then `!cb` will be falsy, and vice versa. In the original code, `cb` is called if it is truthy, but if `!cb` is used instead, `cb` will be called if it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a function, so it cannot be called like a function. In the original code, `cb` is called as a function, but if `null` is used instead, the code will throw a `TypeError` because `null` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive
