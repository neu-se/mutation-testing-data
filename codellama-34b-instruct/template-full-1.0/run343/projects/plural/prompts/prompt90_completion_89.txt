  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\bhavior\b/i, 'à animals')
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would match words like "behavior" and return "à animals", while the original rule would return "à animal".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\bactic\b/i, '\;act')
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would match words like "actic" and return "act", while the original rule would return "acticity".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/al$/i, 'iedz Fritz')
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would match words like "eBook" and return "eBooks Fritz", while the original rule would return "eBooks".

DONE.
