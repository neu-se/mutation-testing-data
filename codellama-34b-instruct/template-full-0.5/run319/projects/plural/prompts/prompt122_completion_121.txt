  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an 'es' ending to all words that end with 's', regardless of whether they are already plural or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/s$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last letter of a word before adding an 'es' ending, which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that end with 's'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/s$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last two letters of a word before adding an 'es'
