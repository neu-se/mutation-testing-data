 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a boolean `true` instead of `null` as the first argument to the callback function, which might cause the calling code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `data` variable instead of `null` as the first argument to the callback function, which might cause the calling code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Forced error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force an error to be thrown instead of passing `null` as the first argument to the callback function, which might cause the calling code to handle the error differently.

DONE.
