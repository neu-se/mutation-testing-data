  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1]` is a function that takes two arguments, whereas `rule[0]` is a regular expression or a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule.test(word)` is a boolean value that indicates whether the regular expression or string in `rule[0]` matches the word, whereas `rule[0]` is a regular expression or a string that is used to test the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.match(rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because `word.match(rule[0])` is an array of matches for the regular expression or string in `rule[0]`, whereas `rule[0]` is a regular expression or a string that is used to test the word.

DONE.
