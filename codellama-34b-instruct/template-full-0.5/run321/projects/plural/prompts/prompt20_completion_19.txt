  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an "es" to words ending in "x", "ch", or "s", while this new code fragment adds an "s" to words ending in "x", "ch", or "s".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'xes' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an "es" to words ending in "x", "ch", or "s", while this new code fragment adds an "xes" to words ending in "x", "ch", or "s".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' + 'es' }
