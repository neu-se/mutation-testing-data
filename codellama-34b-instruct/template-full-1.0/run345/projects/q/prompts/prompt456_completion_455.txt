  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf.bind(null, unhandledRejections)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` changes the context of the `array_indexOf` function and applies the `null` context to the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` is a method of the `unhandledRejections` array and cannot be used in the same way as `array_indexOf`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (arr, elem) { return arr.indexOf(elem) >= 0; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function returned by this expression would always return `true`, regardless of the presence of `promise` in `unhandledRejections`.

DONE.
