  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which means that the original array is not modified when the copy is modified. In the original code, the `promises` array is modified when the `promises[index] = value` assignment is made, which could have unintended consequences if the array is used elsewhere in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `promises` array and the `value` array, which means that the original `promises` array is not modified. In the original code, the `promises` array is modified when the `promises[index] = value` assignment is made, which could have unintended consequences if the array is used elsewhere in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.sp
