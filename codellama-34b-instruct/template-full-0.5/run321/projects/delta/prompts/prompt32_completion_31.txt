  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseInverted
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseInverted` is not an object, and therefore does not have the `reduce` method. This would cause an error when trying to call `Object.keys(<PLACEHOLDER>).reduce()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr
```
This would result in different behavior because `attr` is an object, and therefore does not have the `reduce` method. This would cause an error when trying to call `Object.keys(<PLACEHOLDER>).reduce()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is an object, and therefore does not have the `reduce` method. This would cause an error when trying to call `Object.keys(<PLACEHOLDER>).reduce()`.

DONE.
