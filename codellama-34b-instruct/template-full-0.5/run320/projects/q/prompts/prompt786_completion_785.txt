  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rejected` function to be called with the rejection reason as its argument, rather than the `resolved` function being called with the fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rejected` function to be called with `undefined` as its argument, rather than the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `resolved` function to be called with `undefined` as its argument, rather than the fulfillment value.

DONE.
