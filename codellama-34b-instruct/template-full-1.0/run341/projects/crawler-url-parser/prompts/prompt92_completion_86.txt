  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to add 1 to the `href` property, which is a string, and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `href` string, which is not the same as the original code that returns the `href` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "http(s)://" protocol from the `href` string, which is not the same as the original code that returns the `href` property as is.

DONE.
