  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream should be aborted, while `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of any specific value. This change would cause the code to behave differently when the stream is aborted, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream should be aborted, while `null` is a value that indicates the absence of any specific value. This change would cause the code to behave differently when the stream is aborted, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
