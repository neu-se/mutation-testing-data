  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would emit an `'error'` event instead of `'drain'`, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would emit a `'close'` event instead of `'drain'`, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would emit an `'end'` event instead of `'drain'`, which could cause the application to behave differently.

DONE.
