  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `null` to the country with the specified `id`, instead of returning the country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = 'foo';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the string `'foo'` to the country with the specified `id`, instead of returning the country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = { name: 'foo' };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new country object with the name `'foo'` to the country with the specified `id`, instead of returning the country object.

DONE.
