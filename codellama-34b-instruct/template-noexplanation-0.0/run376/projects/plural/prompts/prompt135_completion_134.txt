  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This change will cause the regular expression to match the lowercase version of the word, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(1)
```
This change will cause the regular expression to match the word without its first character, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.replace(/y$/, 'ies')
```
This change will cause the regular expression to match the word with the 'ies' suffix instead of the 'y' suffix, which may not be intended.

DONE.
