  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + object
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 + object` would be a number, while `object` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.nonExistentProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.nonExistentProperty` would throw a `TypeError`, while `object` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(object).length` would return the number of keys in the object, while `object` would return a reference to the object.

DONE.
