  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `deferred.resolve` immediately instead of pushing it to `nodeArgs` as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `Q.delay` instead of `deferred.makeNodeResolver`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `Q.resolve` instead of `deferred.makeNodeResolver`.

DONE.
