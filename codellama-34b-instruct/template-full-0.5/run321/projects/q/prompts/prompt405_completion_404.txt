  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a rejected promise, which would cause the `then` method to invoke its second callback (the rejection handler) instead of the first (the fulfillment handler).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` creates a resolved promise, which would cause the `then` method to invoke its first callback (the fulfillment handler) instead of the second (the rejection handler).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a rejected promise with a specific error message, which would cause the `then` method to invoke its second callback (the rejection handler) with the error as an argument.

DONE.
