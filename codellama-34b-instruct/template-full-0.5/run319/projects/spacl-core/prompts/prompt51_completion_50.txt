  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `1` to indicate that the path must begin with a slash, while `0` would not have this requirement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `1` to indicate that the path must begin with a slash, while `2` would require the path to begin with two slashes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `1` to indicate that the path must begin with a slash, while `-1` would require the path to not begin with a slash.

DONE.
