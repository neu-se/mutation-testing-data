  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(?<!\w)(nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus)/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative lookbehind assertion `(?<!\w)` would prevent the words from being matched if they are not preceded by a word character, while the original code fragment would match the words regardless of whether they are preceded by a word character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus)\b/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the boundary matchers `\b` would ensure that the words are only matched if they are surrounded by word boundaries, while the original code fragment would match the words regardless of whether they are surrounded by word boundaries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\B(nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus)\B/
