  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `this.matches`, causing the `if` statement to execute the opposite branch than it would with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `this.matches`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `this.matches`.

DONE.
