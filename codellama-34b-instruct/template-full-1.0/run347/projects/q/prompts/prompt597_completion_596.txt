  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatchReturn
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatchReturn` is not a valid method of `Q`, and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatchResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatchResolve` is not a valid method of `Q`, and would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatchPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatchPromise` is not a valid method of `Q`, and would throw an error.

DONE.
