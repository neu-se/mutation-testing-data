  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments), 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `arguments` object, which is a built-in JavaScript object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while the modified code fragment uses a separate `array_slice` function to extract the values of the arguments from the `arguments` object. This could cause the function to behave differently if the arguments passed to the function are not passed in the expected order or if the function is called with a different number of arguments than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `arguments` object to extract the values of the arguments passed to the function, while the modified code fragment uses a separate `array_slice` function to extract the values of the arguments from the `arguments` object, starting from the second argument. This could cause the function to behave differently if the arguments passed to the function
