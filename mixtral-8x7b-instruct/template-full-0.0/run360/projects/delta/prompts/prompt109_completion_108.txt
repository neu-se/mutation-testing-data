 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the modulo operator to check if the index is even, instead of checking if the predicate returns true for the op and index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
index > 5
