  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `parseFloat` function to parse the string representation of a number, but the new code fragment is using the `tokens[i + 1]` string directly, which could result in a different numerical value if the string is not a valid representation of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1].length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `parseFloat` function to parse the string representation of a number, but the new code fragment is using the `tokens[i + 1].length` property to get the length of the string, which could result in a different numerical value if the string is not a valid representation of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1].charCodeAt(0)
```
This would result in
