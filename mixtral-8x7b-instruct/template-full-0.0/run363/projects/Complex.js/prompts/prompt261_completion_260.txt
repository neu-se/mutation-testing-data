 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the imaginary part of the current complex number instead of using the local variable `b`. This could lead to incorrect results when the complex number's internal state changes between calls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the complex number, ignoring the argument. This would make the 'log' method incorrect for complex numbers with a non-zero argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces randomness in the calculation, which is not intended in the original implementation. This could lead to unpredictable results and make the 'log' method unreliable.

DONE.
