  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would receive a duplicate key, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that handles the dispatched message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would receive a different key, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that handles the dispatched message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would receive a string key, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that handles the dispatched message.

DONE.
