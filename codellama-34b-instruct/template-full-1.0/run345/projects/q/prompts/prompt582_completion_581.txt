  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind("throw", reject)
```
This would result in the "throw" argument being passed to the "bind" method, rather than the "throw" keyword, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(reject, "throw")
```
This would result in a different order of arguments being passed to the "bind" method, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(function () { return reject(); })
```
This would result in a different function being passed as the first argument to "bind", which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
