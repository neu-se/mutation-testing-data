  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, flag: 'w' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flag` option is set to `'w'`, which means that the file will be overwritten if it already exists, whereas the original code fragment did not specify a `flag` option, so the file would be appended to if it already existed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is set to `'utf8'`, which means that the file will be written using UTF-8 encoding, whereas the original code fragment did not specify an `encoding` option, so the file would be written using the default encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, mode: 0o666 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` option is set to `0o666`, which means that the
