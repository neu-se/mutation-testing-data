 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'chilli'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment converts the singular form "chilli" to "chillies" in the plural form, while the new code fragment would not apply any rule to the word, resulting in the same singular form for both singular and plural cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'chillys'
