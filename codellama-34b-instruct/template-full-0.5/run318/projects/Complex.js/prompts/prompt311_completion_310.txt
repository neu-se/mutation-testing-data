  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` are inverse functions, meaning that `Math.sin(x) = Math.cos(x + Math.PI/2)`. Therefore, if `Math.cos` is replaced with `Math.sin`, the resulting angle will be shifted by `Math.PI/2` radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.cos` are related functions, meaning that `Math.tan(x) = Math.sin(x) / Math.cos(x)`. Therefore, if `Math.cos` is replaced with `Math.tan`, the resulting angle will be scaled by the sine of the input angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` and `Math.
