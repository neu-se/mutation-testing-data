  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first character of the slice, which could cause the `forEach` loop to miss the first character of the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex - 1, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include an extra character at the beginning of the slice, which could cause the `forEach` loop to include an extra character in the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last character of the slice, which could cause the `forEach` loop to miss the last character of the line.

DONE.
