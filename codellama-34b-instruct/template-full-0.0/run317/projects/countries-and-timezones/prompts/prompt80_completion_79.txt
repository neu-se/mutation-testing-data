  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return `null` instead of a valid timezone object, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an empty array instead of an array of country objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"timezone"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a timezone object with a different name than the one passed in, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an array of country objects that are not associated with the correct timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"country"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a timezone object that is not associated with the correct country, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an array of country objects that are not associated with the correct timezone.

DONE.
