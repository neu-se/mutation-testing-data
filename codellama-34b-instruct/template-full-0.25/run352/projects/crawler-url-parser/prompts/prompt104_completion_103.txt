  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the text includes a space, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the text has a length greater than 0, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes("http")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the text includes the string "http", which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
