  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the number is not a number, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, so `!this['isInfinite']` would be true if the number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while `this['isInfinite']` would be true if the number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

DONE.
