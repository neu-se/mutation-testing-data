  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because using the greater than operator `>` instead of the less than operator `<` would cause the function to behave as if `b` is positive, even if it is negative, which could lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because using the not equal to operator `!==` instead of the less than operator `<` would cause the function to behave as if `b` is non-zero, even if it is zero, which could lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1 < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because using the arithmetic operator `+` and the less than operator `<` would cause the function to behave as if `b` is negative, even if it is positive, which could lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

DONE.
