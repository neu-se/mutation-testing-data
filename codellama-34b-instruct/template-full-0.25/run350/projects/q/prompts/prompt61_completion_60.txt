  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `window` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, whereas `window` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object in non-strict mode, whereas `window` explicitly refers to the global object.

DONE.
