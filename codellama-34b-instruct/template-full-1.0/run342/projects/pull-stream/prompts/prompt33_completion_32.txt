  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment modifies the value of `read`, while the replacement code fragment has no effect on `read`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment modifies the value of `read`, while the replacement code fragment has no effect on `read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment modifies the value of `read`, while the replacement code fragment has no effect on `read`.

DONE.
