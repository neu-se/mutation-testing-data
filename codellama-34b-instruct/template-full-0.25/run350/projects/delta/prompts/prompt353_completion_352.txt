  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument of `1`, which would remove the first element of the `inverted` array, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `chop`, resulting in all trailing empty arrays being removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument of `-1`, which would remove the last element of the `inverted` array, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `chop`, resulting in all trailing empty arrays being removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument of `0`, which would remove all elements of the `inverted
