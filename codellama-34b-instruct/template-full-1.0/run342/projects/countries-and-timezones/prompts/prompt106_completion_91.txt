  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `country` object is expected to have an `id` property, which is not a primitive value, and comparing it to `null` would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country` is an object and will not be equal to `null`, even if all of its properties are empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if `country` does not have an `id` property, it will be `undefined`, and comparing it to `null` will always return `false`.

DONE.
