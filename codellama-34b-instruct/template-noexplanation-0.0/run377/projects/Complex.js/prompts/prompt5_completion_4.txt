  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x)
```
This is the original code fragment, which is correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) + Math.exp(-x)
```
This code fragment is incorrect because it adds the exponential of x to the exponential of -x, which is always greater than the original value of Math.exp(x).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) - Math.exp(-x)
```
This code fragment is incorrect because it subtracts the exponential of -x from the exponential of x, which is always less than the original value of Math.exp(x).

DONE.
