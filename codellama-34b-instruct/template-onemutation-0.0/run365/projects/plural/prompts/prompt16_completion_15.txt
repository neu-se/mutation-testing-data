  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes two arguments, the first is the starting position and the second is the length of the substring. In the original code, the starting position is `0` and the length is `w.length - 1`, which means the substring will include all characters from the beginning of the word to the last character. However, if the starting position is changed to `1`, the substring will start from the second character, excluding the first character, and the length is still `w.length - 1`, which means the substring will include all characters from the second character to the last character, effectively removing the first character from the word.

DONE.
