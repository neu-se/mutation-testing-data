  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will cause a TypeError to be thrown when the `nodeArgs.push()` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a number and will cause a TypeError to be thrown when the `nodeArgs.push()` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, which is not the same as the original deferred object used by the surrounding code.

DONE.
