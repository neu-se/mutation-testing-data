  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys()` method returns an array of all the own enumerable properties of an object, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.values()` method returns an array of all the own enumerable property values of an object, whereas the original code fragment returns an array of all the own enumerable property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.entries()` method returns an array of key-value pairs of an object, whereas the original code fragment returns an array of all the own enumerable property names.

DONE.
