  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(new Error("Some error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` creates a new error object with a new stack trace, while `rejected` is a function that takes an error as an argument and handles it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is a function that takes a value as an argument and handles it, while `rejected` is a function that takes an error as an argument and handles it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Some error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an error immediately, while `rejected` is a function that takes an error as an argument and handles it.

DONE.
