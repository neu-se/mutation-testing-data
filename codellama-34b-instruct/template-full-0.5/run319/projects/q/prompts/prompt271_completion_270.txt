  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolvedPromise` variable is used to check if the promise has been resolved, and setting it to `true` would cause the code to believe that the promise has been resolved, even if it hasn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolvedPromise` variable is used to check if the promise has been resolved, and setting it to `false` would cause the code to believe that the promise has not been resolved, even if it has.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise = !resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolvedPromise` variable is used to check if the promise has been resolved, and negating its value would cause the code to believe that the opposite of what it actually is.

DONE.
