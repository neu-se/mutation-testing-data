 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(w.substr(0, w.length - 2), 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the letter 'i' instead of correctly applying the plural form for Latin/Greek words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.slice(0, -2) + 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method instead of the `substr` method, which may behave differently depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.substring(0, w.length - 2) + 'i'
