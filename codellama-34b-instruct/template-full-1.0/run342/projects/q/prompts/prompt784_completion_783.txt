  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "undefined", but `null` is a distinct value that represents "no value".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is the value that is returned when a function or variable is not declared, or when a property does not exist on an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "Not a Number", and it will be treated as "false" in a boolean context, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
