  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` as-is, while the mutated code fragment uses the negative of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` as-is, while the mutated code fragment adds 1 to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` as-is, while the mutated code fragment multiplies `b` by 2.

DONE.
