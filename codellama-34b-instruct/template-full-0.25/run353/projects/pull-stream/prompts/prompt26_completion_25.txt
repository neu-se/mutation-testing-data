  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `pull` function with 4 arguments, which is not the same as the original code fragment that called the `pull` function with 3 arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `pull` function with 5 arguments, which is not the same as the original code fragment that called the `pull` function with 3 arguments.
