  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null || name === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the variable `name` is either `null` or `undefined`, while the buggy code fragment checks if `name` is either `null` or `void 0`, which is always `true`. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when `name` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null || name === void 0 || name === ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the variable `name` is either `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string, while the buggy code fragment checks if `name` is either `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string, or if it is a string that is not empty. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when `name` is an empty string.
