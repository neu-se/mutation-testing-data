  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while `{}` is an empty object that does not have any properties or methods.

DONE.
