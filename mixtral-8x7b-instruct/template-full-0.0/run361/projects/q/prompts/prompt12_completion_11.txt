 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ses.ok()` check would always return false, and the `Q` object would not be initialized as a global in non-windowed contexts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof ses === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ses.ok()` check would never be executed, and the `Q` object would not be initialized as a global in non-windowed contexts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ses.ok()` check would always return true, and the `Q` object would be initialized as a global even in cases where it is not supported, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

DONE.
