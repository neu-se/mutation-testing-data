  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, noop);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function would be called instead of the `rejected` function, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, function () { throw new Error("Intentional error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would throw an intentional error, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, function () { return Q.reject("Intentional rejection"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
