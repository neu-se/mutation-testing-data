  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `2`, which would include the second argument to `Q.fbind` in the array of arguments, instead of excluding it as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.length` would return the number of arguments passed to `Q.fbind`, instead of the number of arguments passed to the function returned by `Q.fbind`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[0]` would return the first argument passed to `Q.fbind`, instead of the array of arguments passed to the function returned by `Q.fbind`.

DONE.
