  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with only one argument, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls the callback function with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with only one argument, while the new code fragment `cb(end, null)` calls the callback function with two arguments, where the second argument is always `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with only one argument, while the new code fragment `cb(end, data)` calls the callback function with two arguments, where the second argument is the same as the first argument.

DONE.
