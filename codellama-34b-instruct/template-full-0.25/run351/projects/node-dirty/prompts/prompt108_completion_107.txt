  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buffer.length` property would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the buffer is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buffer.length` property would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the buffer is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buffer.length` property would be compared to 0, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if the buffer is empty, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
