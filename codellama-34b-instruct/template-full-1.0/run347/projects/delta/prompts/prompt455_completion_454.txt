  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` would start the slice from the first element, whereas the original code used `this.index`, which is the current index of the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(-1)` would start the slice from the last element, whereas the original code used `this.index`, which is the current index of the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(this.index + 1)` would start the slice from the next element after the current index, whereas the original code used `this.index`, which is the current index of the iterator.

DONE.
