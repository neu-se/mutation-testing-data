 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
error.stack.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the stack trace to a string, which may not have the desired properties for further processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
error['stack']
