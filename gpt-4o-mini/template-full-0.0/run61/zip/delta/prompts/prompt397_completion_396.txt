Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the next operation from the `otherIter` instead of pushing the current operation, potentially altering the intended transformation of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(otherIter.next().retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete the length of the next operation from `otherIter`, which could lead to data loss instead of adding the operation to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, which would incorrectly apply the operations from the current delta instead of the one being transformed.

DONE.
