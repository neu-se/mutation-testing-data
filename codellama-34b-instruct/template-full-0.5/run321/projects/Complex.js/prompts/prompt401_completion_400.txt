  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `res['im']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `res['im']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `res['im']`.

DONE.
