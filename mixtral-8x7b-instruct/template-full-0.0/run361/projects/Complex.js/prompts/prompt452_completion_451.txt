 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(z['im'] - this['im']) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different operator (`<` instead of `<=`). This could cause some cases where the original code would return true, but the mutated code would return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(z['im'] - this['im'] <= 2 * Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the constant value (`2 * Complex['EPSILON']` instead of `Complex['EPSILON']`). This could cause some cases where the original code would return false, but the mutated code would return true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(z['im'] - this['im']).toFixed(2) === '0.00'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the
