Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values, rather than the keys, which would change the logic of the subsequent reduction and potentially lead to incorrect attribute mapping.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attr).filter(key => attr[key] !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because filtering out keys with `null` values would change which attributes are considered during the reduction, potentially omitting valid attributes that should be included in the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(attr)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs, which would require a different handling mechanism in the reduction process, likely leading to incorrect attribute assignments or omissions.

DONE.
