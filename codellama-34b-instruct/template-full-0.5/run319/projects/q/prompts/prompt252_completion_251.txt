  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch(newPromise, message);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `newPromise` object, which is not the same as calling it on the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call(newPromise, message);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `newPromise` object with the `message` argument, but it would not pass the `newPromise` object as the `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(newPromise, [message]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `newPromise` object with the `message` argument as an array, which is not the same as passing
