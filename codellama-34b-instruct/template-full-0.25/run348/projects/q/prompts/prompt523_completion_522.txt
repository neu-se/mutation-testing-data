  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[name].apply(object, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method with the `object` as the context, whereas the original code calls it with `void 0` as the context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[name].apply(object, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method with the `object` as the context, whereas the original code calls it with `void 0` as the context.
