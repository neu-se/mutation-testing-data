Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!node.isFile()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is not a file instead of checking if it's a directory, potentially allowing files to be opened with flags that are meant for directories.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.isSymbolicLink()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is a symbolic link instead of a directory, which could lead to incorrect error handling for symbolic links.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.isBlockDevice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is a block device instead of a directory, which could lead to incorrect error handling for block devices and potentially allow block devices to be opened with flags that are meant for directories.

DONE.
