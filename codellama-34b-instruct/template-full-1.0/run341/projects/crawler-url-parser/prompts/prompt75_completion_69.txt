  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'a' is a character that is not present in the original anchor tag's href attribute, whereas 'base' is a string that is present in the attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#base'
```
This would result in different behavior because '#base' is a string that is not present in the original anchor tag's href attribute, whereas 'base' is a string that is present in the attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
#{base}
```
This would result in different behavior because #{base} is a string that is not present in the original anchor tag's href attribute, whereas 'base' is a string that is present in the attribute.

DONE.
