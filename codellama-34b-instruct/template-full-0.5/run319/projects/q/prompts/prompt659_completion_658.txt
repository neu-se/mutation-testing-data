  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, and the `dispatch` method would be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, and the `dispatch` method would be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, and the `dispatch` method would be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
