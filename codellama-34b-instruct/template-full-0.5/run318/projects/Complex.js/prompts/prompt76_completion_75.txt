  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one additional time, potentially causing the parser to exit prematurely or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, causing the parser to exit without processing any input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i != tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one fewer time than the original code, potentially causing the parser to miss the last token.

DONE.
