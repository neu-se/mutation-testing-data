 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` is not a method that exists on a writable stream, and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('some random data')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write 'some random data' to the stream, instead of corking it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the cork property to false, instead of calling the cork method.

DONE.
