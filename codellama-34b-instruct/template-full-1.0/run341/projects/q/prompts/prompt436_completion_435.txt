  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is present in the array, whereas the original code checks if the index of the promise is not -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index of the promise is greater than or equal to 0, whereas the original code checks if the index is not -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_includes(unhandledRejections, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is included in the array, whereas the original code checks if the index of the promise is not -1.

DONE.
