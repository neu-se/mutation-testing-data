  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a rejected promise, whereas `Q.defer` creates a deferred promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Q.defer` creates a deferred promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` creates a new deferred promise, whereas `Q.defer` creates a deferred promise that is already resolved.

DONE.
