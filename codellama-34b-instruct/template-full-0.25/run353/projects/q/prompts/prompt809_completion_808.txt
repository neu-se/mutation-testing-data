  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.apply !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `!callback` expression would be evaluated first, and then the `typeof callback.apply !== "function"` expression would be evaluated. This would result in the `!callback` expression always being evaluated, even if `callback` is not a function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict equality, so it would only return `true` if `callback` is not a function, and not if it is any other type of value. This would result in the `callback.apply` method being called even if `callback` is not a function, which could cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback !== "function"
```
This would
