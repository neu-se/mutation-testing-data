Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback with `null` instead of the original value, which may lead to unexpected results in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the original value by incrementing it by 1 before passing it to the callback, which changes the data being processed in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function() { return "error"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the resolution of the promise to always return the string "error" instead of the original value, altering the expected outcome of the promise chain.

DONE.
