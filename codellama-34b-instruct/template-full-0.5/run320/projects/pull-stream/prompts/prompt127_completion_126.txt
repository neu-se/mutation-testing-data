  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `i` variable instead of incrementing it, which could cause the function to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `max` variable instead of the `i` variable, which could cause the function to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the `i` variable instead of incrementing it, which could cause the function to return a different value than expected.

DONE.
