  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because if `a[key]` is `null`, the `transform` method would return `b`, even if `b[key]` is also `null`. In the original code, `transform` would only return `undefined` if `a[key]` was `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because if `a[key]` and `b[key]` are the same, the `transform` method would return `b`, even if `b[key]` is `undefined`. In the original code, `transform` would only return `undefined` if `a[key]` was `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key] && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if `a[key]` and `b[key]` are
