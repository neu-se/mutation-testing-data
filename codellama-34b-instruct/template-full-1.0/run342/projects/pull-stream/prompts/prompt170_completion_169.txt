  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with `null` as its first argument, whereas in the modified code, `null` is returned instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with `undefined` as its first argument, whereas in the modified code, `undefined` is returned instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var x
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with `var x` as its first argument, whereas in the modified code, `var x` is defined but not called.

DONE.
