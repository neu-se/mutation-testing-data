  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` method would throw a `SyntaxError` if the `reviver` function is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` method would use the default `reviver` function, which is not the same as the original `reviver` function provided by the user.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` method would use a different `reviver` function than the original one provided by the user.

DONE.
