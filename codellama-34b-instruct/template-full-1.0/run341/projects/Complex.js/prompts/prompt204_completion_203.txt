  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the number, which is not the same as subtracting 1 from the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the imaginary part of the number from the real part, rather than subtracting 1 from the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * (b - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the number by the difference between the imaginary part and 1, rather than subtracting 1 from the complex number.

DONE.
