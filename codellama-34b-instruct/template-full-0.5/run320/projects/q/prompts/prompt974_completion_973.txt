  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nmapply` expects an object as its first argument, but `null` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nmapply` expects an object as its first argument, but `undefined` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nmapply` expects an object with a `post` method, but `{}` does not have a `post` method.

DONE.
