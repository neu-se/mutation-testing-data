  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
    throw new Error("Test error");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would resolve the promise with the result of calling `array_slice`, while the modified code would reject the promise with the error thrown by the new function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
    return;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would resolve the promise with the result of calling `array_slice`, while the modified code would resolve the promise with `undefined`, since the new function does not return a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
    return "Test";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would resolve the promise with the result of calling `array_slice`, while the modified code would resolve the promise with the string "Test".

DONE.
