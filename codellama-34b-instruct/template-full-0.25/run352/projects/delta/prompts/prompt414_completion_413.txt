  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the offset to be incremented by one more than the length of the current operation, which would cause the `while` loop to iterate one more time than it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the offset to be decremented by one less than the length of the current operation, which would cause the `while` loop to iterate one fewer times than it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the offset to be incremented by twice the length of the current operation, which would cause the `while` loop to iterate twice as many times as it should.

DONE.
