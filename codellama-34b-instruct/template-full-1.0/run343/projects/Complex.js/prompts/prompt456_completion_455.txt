  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['re'] - this['re']) > Complex['EPSILON'] &&
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON'];
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` would always return a positive value, causing the result to be the opposite of the expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === this['re'] && z['im'] === this['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because `===` checks for equality with 0, while the original code checks for equality with `Complex['EPSILON']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['re'] - this['re']) <= Complex['EPSILON'] &&
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) > Complex['EPSILON'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of
