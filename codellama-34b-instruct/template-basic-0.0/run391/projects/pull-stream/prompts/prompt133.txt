Consider the following code fragment:
```
'use strict'
//a stream that ends immediately.
module.exports = function empty () {
  return function (abort, cb) {
    <PLACEHOLDER>(true)
  }
}

```

Please provide a code fragment that PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
