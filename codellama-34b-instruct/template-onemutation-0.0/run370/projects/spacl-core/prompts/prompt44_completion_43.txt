  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to escape special characters in the `part` variable, while the new code fragment does not. This could cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression, which could in turn cause the `Matcher` class to behave differently.

DONE.
