  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing a property of the object instead of the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.key.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing a property of the object's property instead of the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.key.value.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing a property of the object's property's property instead of the object itself.

DONE.
