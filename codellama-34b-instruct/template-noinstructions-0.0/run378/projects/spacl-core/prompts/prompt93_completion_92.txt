  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to always set the policy with the same name, rather than adding a new policy to the collection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to always set the policy with the same name as the policy being added, rather than adding a new policy to the collection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to always set the policy with the same name as the policy being added to `null`, rather than adding a new policy to the collection.

DONE.
