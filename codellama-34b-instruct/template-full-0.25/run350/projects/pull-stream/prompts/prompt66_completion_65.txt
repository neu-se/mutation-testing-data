  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is equal to `false`. If `end` is not equal to `false`, the original code fragment would return `end`, while this new code fragment would return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is not equal to `true`. If `end` is equal to `true`, the original code fragment would return `null`, while this new code fragment would return `end`.
