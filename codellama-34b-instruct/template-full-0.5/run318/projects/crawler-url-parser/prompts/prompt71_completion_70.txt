  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/\s+/g, '')

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `trim()` method to remove whitespace from both ends of the string, while the new code fragment uses a regular expression to remove all whitespace characters from the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `trim()` method to remove whitespace from both ends of the string, while the new code fragment uses a regular expression to remove whitespace characters only from the beginning and end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/\s+/g, '').toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `trim()` method to remove whitespace from both ends of the string, while the new code fragment uses a regular expression to remove all whitespace characters from the string and then
