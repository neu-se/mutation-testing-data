  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the `arguments` object to be coerced into a number, which would likely result in `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the third argument from the `arguments` object, regardless of its type or whether it exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(arguments[2])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` would create a new promise that resolves to the third argument of the `arguments` object, regardless of its type or whether it exists.

DONE.
