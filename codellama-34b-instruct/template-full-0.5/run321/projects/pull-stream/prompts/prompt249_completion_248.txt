  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an additional argument to the `_read` function, which is not expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value for the second argument to the `_read` function, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value for the first argument to the `_read` function, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
