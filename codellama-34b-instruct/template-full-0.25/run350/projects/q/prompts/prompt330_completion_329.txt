  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `message` property, unlike the original `exception` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the new error message would be different from the original error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ message: "Different error message" }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new error object has a different `message` property than the original error object.

DONE.
