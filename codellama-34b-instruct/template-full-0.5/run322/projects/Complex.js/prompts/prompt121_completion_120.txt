  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isInfinite` method, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the divisor is real and the dividend is infinite, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if a value is a finite number, which is not the same as checking if a value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if a value is not a number, which is not the same as checking if a value is infinite.

DONE.
