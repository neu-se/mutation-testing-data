  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, error
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `ms` parameter is used to set the timeout duration, while in this modified code it is always set to 0, resulting in the promise timing out immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms + 1, error
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `ms` parameter is used to set the timeout duration, while in this modified code it is increased by 1, resulting in a slightly longer timeout duration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms * 2, error
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `ms` parameter is used to set the timeout duration, while in this modified code it is doubled, resulting in a longer timeout duration.

DONE.
