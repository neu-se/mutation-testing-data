  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` promise would never be resolved, causing the `get` method to never return a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ends.promise` would be resolved with a null value, causing the `get` method to return a null value instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.head = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ends.promise` would be resolved with a null value for the `head` property, causing the `get` method to return a null value instead of the expected value.

DONE.
