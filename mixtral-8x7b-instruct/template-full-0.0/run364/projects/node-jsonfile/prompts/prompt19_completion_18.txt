 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + file
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to read a file with a relative path of './' appended to the original file path, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
_fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the synchronous version of the `readFile` function, potentially causing performance issues or blocking the event loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file, 'utf8'
