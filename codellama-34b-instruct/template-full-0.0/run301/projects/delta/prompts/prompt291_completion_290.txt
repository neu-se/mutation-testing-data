  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to return a different value.

DONE.
