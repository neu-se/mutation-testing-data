  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` will always be truthy, even if a falsy value was passed in.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = false
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` will always be false, even if a truthy value was passed in.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = !done
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` will be flipped from the original value of `done`.

DONE.
