  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only access files that have both read and write permissions, whereas the original code fragment would access files with either read or write permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access execute files, whereas the original code fragment would only access read and write files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(targetBasePath), fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for read and write permissions in the parent directory of the target base path, whereas the original code fragment would check for read and write permissions in the target base path itself.

DONE.
