Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `cursor` parameter with a constant value of `0`, which may lead to incorrect indexing or processing of the deltas, potentially causing unexpected results in the diff operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `cursor` parameter to `null`, which may cause the diff function to handle the cursor incorrectly, leading to potential errors or skipped operations during the diffing process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the strings being compared, which could lead to a completely different diff result, as the comparison logic relies on the order of the inputs to determine the differences.

DONE.
