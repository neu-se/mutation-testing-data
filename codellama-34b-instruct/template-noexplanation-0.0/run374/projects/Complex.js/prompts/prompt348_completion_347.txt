  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This change will cause the function to return the wrong value for the complex arcus sinus.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This change will cause the function to return the wrong value for the complex arcus cosinus.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This change will cause the function to return the wrong value for the complex arcus tangens.

DONE.
