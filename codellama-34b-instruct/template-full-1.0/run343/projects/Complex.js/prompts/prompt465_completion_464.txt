  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"b"
```
This would result in different behavior because "b" is a string, whereas the original fragment is a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying by 2 changes the value of b, whereas the original fragment uses the value of b as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not a number, whereas the original fragment expects a number as input.

DONE.
