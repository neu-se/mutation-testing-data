  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)(file, options)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `universalify.fromCallback` method to convert the `fs.readFile` method into a universal function that can be used with both callbacks and promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise(fs.readFile)(file, options)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `universalify.fromPromise` method to convert the `fs.readFile` method into a universal function that can be used with both promises and callbacks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)(file, options)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `universalify.fromCallback` method to convert the `fs.readFileSync` method into a universal function
