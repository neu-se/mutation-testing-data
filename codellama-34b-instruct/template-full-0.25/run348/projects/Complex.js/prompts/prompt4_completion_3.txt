  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a bug where it is missing a multiplication operator. The corrected code fragment would be:
```
x * (1 + 1)
```
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a bug where it is missing a multiplication operator. The corrected code fragment would be:
```
x * (1 - 1)
```
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a bug where it is missing a multiplication operator. The corrected code fragment would be:
```
x * (1 / 2)
```
DONE.
