  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array. In this case, the `addRule` function is called with the new rule added to the beginning of the `rules` array, which would cause the new rule to be applied before any existing rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from an array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array. In this case, the `addRule` function is called with the new rule added to the end of the `rules` array, which would cause the new rule to be applied after any existing rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.splice(0, 0, [match, result])
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice`
