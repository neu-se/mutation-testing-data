  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return 1, regardless of the input, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return -1, regardless of the input, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the string "hello", regardless of the input, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
