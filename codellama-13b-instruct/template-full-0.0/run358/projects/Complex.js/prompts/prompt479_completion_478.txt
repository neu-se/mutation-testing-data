  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method would return `true` for all complex numbers, regardless of whether they are finite or infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method would return `true` for all complex numbers with a non-zero imaginary part, regardless of whether they are finite or infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method would return `true` for all complex numbers with a non-zero real or imaginary part, regardless of whether they are finite or infinite.

DONE.
