  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is expected to be a stream, but `null` is not a valid stream. The test case would likely fail in this case, revealing a bug in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is expected to be a stream, but `undefined` is not a valid stream. The test case would likely fail in this case, revealing a bug in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is expected to be a stream, but `NaN` is not a valid stream. The test case would likely fail in this case, revealing a bug in the test suite.

DONE.
