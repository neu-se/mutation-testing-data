Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in write mode instead of read mode, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors if the file does not exist or cannot be written to.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'wx'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in exclusive write mode, which would fail if the file already exists, whereas the original code would open the file in read mode regardless of its existence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in append mode, which would allow writing to the end of the file instead of reading from it, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors if the intention is to read from the file.

DONE.
