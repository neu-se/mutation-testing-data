  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire part string against the given regular expression, whereas the original code fragment only matched the first character of the part string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the entire part string matches the given regular expression, whereas the original code fragment only checked if the first character of the part string matched.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part[0].match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the first character of the part string against the given regular expression, whereas the original code fragment matched the entire part string
