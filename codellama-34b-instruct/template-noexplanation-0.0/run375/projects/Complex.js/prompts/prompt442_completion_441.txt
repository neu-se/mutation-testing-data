  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This will cause the `round` method to return a different result than expected, as `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, rather than the power of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This will cause the `round` method to return a random number, rather than the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This will cause the `round` method to return a different result than expected, as `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number, rather than the power of a number.

DONE.
