  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is applied to the wrong variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator is applied to the wrong variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is applied to the wrong variable and the result is squared.

DONE.
