  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with the `keys` action, which is not the same as the original code that called `dispatch` with the `post` action.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with an empty array of arguments, which is not the same as the original code that called `dispatch` with an array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially result in a different behavior.

DONE.
