  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2` is a constant, while `2 + 1` is an expression that computes the value 3.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2` is a constant, while `Math.pow(2, 1)` is a function call that computes the value 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2` is a constant, while `Number(2)` is a function call that converts the value 2 to a number.

DONE.
