  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, whereas the original code fragment checks if the real part is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the complex number is not zero, whereas the original code fragment checks if the real part is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the complex number is infinite, whereas the original code fragment checks if the real part is zero.

DONE.
