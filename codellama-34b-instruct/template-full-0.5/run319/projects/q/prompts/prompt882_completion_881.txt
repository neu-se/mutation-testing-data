  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject()` would be called immediately, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` would be called immediately, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify();
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify()` would be called immediately, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
