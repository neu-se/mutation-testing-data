  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` does not throw an error, while the new code fragment throws an error with a message that includes the last error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` does not reject the promise, while the new code fragment rejects the promise with the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify({ index: index, value: progress });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` does not notify the promise, while the new code fragment notifies the promise with the progress value.

DONE.
