  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cotangent of `b` instead of `a`, which would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cotangent of `a + b` instead of `a`, which would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cotangent of `a * b` instead of `a`, which would produce a different result.

DONE.
