  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This change will cause the `transform` method to use the length of the other delta's operations instead of the length of the current delta's operations, which may result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This change will cause the `transform` method to use the minimum of the two lengths instead of the length of the current delta's operations, which may result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This change will cause the `transform` method to use the maximum of the two lengths instead of the length of the current delta's operations, which may result in different behavior.

DONE.
