  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenReject` method to always return the rejection reason, regardless of whether the promise is rejected or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promise).then(function() { return reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenReject` method to always return a promise that is resolved with the rejection reason, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promise).then(null, function() { return reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenReject` method to always return a promise that is rejected with the rejection reason, even if the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
