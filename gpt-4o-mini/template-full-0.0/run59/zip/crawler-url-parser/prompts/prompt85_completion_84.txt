Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text = $(this).text();
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the `trim()` function, which means that any leading or trailing whitespace in the text will not be removed, potentially affecting the output of the `extract` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text = $(this).text().trim().toUpperCase();
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the text to uppercase, which may lead to inconsistencies in how the text is stored in the `urlMap`, affecting the comparison logic later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text = $(this).text().trim().slice(0, 5);
```
This would result in different behavior because it limits the text to the first five characters, which could lead to loss of important information and affect how links are processed and stored in the `urlMap`.

DONE.
