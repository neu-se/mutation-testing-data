  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!pageurl_path.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean result of the `includes` method, leading to a different conclusion about the relationship between the two paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.indexOf(linkurl_path) >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` checks for the existence of a substring within a string, while `includes` checks for the occurrence of a substring within a string, but `includes` also needs to check if the element after it is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if a string starts with a specified substring, while `includes` checks for the occurrence of a substring within a string.

DONE.
