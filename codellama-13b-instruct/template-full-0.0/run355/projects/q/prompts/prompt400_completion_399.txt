  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original promise, while this code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the original promise's fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original promise, while this code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the original promise's fulfillment value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original promise, while this code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the original promise's fulfillment value.

DONE.
