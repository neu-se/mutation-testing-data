  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this, distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the current point and the destination point, instead of the distance between the current point and the origin point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateBearing(distance, bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the destination point and the origin point, instead of the bearing between the current point and the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(distance, bearing, this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination point based on the given distance and bearing relative to the current point, instead of the original calculation which was based on the distance and bearing relative to the origin point.

DONE.
