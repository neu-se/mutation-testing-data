  Sure! Here are my answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in a divide by zero error when calculating `rad2deg(λ2)` because the `cosδ` value is always `1` when `δ` is `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosφ1 * cosθ
```
This would result in a different calculation of `sinφ2` which would impact the final result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * sinα + cosφ1 * (cosδ - sinφ1 * sinφ2)
```
This would result in a different calculation of `λ2` which would impact the final result of the calculation.

DONE.
