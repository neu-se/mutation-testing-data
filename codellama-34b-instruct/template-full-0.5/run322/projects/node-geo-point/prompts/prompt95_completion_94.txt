  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is replaced with `cos`, which would return a different value for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ2` function is replaced with `sinφ1`, which would return a different value for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is replaced with `Math.sin`, which would return a different value for the same input.

DONE.
