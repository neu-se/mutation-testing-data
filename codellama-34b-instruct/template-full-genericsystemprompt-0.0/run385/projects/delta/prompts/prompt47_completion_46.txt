  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to `0`, but the replaced code fragment is checking if `a + 1` is equal to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to `0`, but the replaced code fragment is checking if `a - 1` is equal to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to `0`, but the replaced code fragment is checking if `a * 2` is equal to `0`.

DONE.
