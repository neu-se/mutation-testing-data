  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This change will ensure that the `places` variable is never `0`, which could cause the `Math.pow` function to return `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || Infinity
```
This change will ensure that the `places` variable is never `0` or `NaN`, which could cause the `Math.pow` function to return `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || Math.max(places, 1)
```
This change will ensure that the `places` variable is never `0` or negative, which could cause the `Math.pow` function to return `NaN`.

DONE.
