  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` returns a tuple with the first element being `1` and the second element being `a`, while the modified code fragment `0, a` returns a tuple with the first element being `0` and the second element being `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` returns a tuple with the first element being `1` and the second element being `a`, while the modified code fragment `a, 1` returns a tuple with the first element being `a` and the second element being `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` returns a tuple with the first element being `1` and the second element being `a`, while the modified code fragment
