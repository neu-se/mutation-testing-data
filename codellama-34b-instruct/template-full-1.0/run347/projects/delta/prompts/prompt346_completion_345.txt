  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `opData` variable by 1, which could potentially cause changes to the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!opData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of the `opData` variable, which could potentially cause changes to the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the value of the `opData` variable by 1, which could potentially cause changes to the surrounding code.

DONE.
