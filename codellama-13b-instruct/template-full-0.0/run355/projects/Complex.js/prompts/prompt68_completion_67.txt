  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when the input is invalid, whereas the original code would silently return a complex number with NaN values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a complex number with infinite values, whereas the original code would return a complex number with NaN values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NaN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a complex number with NaN values, whereas the original code would return a complex number with infinite values.

DONE.
