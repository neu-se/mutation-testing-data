 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream || null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `stream` variable is falsy, it will return `null` instead of the original value. This could cause issues if the downstream code expects a non-null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prematurely end the stream, even if there is more data to be read. This could cause issues if the downstream code expects to continue receiving data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pause()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pause the stream, preventing any further data from being read. This could cause issues if the downstream code expects a continuous stream of data.

DONE.
