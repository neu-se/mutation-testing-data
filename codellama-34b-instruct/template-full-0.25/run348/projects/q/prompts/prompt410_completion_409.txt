  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on `value`, which may have different effects than accessing the `inspect` property directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `call` method on `value.inspect`, which may have different effects than accessing the `inspect` property directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply` method on `value.inspect`, which may have different effects than accessing the `inspect` property directly.

DONE.
