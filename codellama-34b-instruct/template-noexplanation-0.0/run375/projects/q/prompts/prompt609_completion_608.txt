  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` method to reject the promise instead of resolving it, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, op, args.slice(1)
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` method to resolve the promise with a different set of arguments than the original code, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, op, args.concat(["extra argument"])
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` method to resolve the promise with an additional argument, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
