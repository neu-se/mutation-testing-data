  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string "foo" to the end of the `path` string, whereas the original code would simply return the `path` string as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would return the `path` string in uppercase, whereas the original code would simply return the `path` string as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return a new string that is a substring of the original `path` string, starting from the second character, whereas the original code would simply return the `path` string as is.

DONE.
