  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the `this` context of the current object, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this)` calls the `dispatch` method of the current object with the `this` context set to the current object, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` calls the `dispatch` method of the current object with the `this` context set to the current object, and passes an empty array as the arguments
