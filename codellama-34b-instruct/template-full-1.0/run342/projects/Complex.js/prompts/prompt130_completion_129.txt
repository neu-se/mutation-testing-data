  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `Complex.NAN` when either `this` or `z` is infinite, regardless of whether the other is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `Complex.NAN` when `this` is infinite and `z` is not, regardless of whether `z` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && !this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `Complex.NAN` when `z` is infinite and `this` is not, regardless of whether `this` is zero.

DONE.
