  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, whereas the `!` operator only checks for value equality. In this case, `trackUnhandledRejections` is a boolean, so `trackUnhandledRejections === false` would only be true if `trackUnhandledRejections` is explicitly set to `false`, whereas `!trackUnhandledRejections` would be true if `trackUnhandledRejections` is `false`, `null`, `undefined`, or any other falsy value.

```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks the type of the variable, whereas the `!` operator only checks for value equality. In this case, `typeof trackUnhandledRejections === "undefined"` would only be true if `trackUnhandledRejections` is not defined, whereas `!
