  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `path.extname()` function returns the file extension (including the dot), whereas in this option, it is compared to an empty string, which would only return true if the file extension is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.extname(options.dest) in ['', '.']
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `!path.extname(options.dest)` operator is used to check if the file extension is not empty, but in this option, it is included in an array of empty strings and `.`, which would only return true if the file extension is empty or `.`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `path.extname()` function returns
