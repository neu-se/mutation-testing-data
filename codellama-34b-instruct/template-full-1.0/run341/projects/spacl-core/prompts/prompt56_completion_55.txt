  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a new string with the specified portion, while `replace()` replaces existing characters with the replacement string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.indexOf(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf()` returns the position of the first occurrence of the specified string, while `replace()` replaces all occurrences of the regex pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split(':')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `split()` returns an array of substrings, while `replace()` replaces all occurrences of the regex pattern.

DONE.
