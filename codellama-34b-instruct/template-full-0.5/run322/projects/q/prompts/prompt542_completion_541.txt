  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive a `null` value instead of an array, and would likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive an `undefined` value instead of an array, and would likely throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive an empty array instead of the original array, and would likely return a promise for a different value.

DONE.
