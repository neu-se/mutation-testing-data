  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment, along with brief explanations:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the file extension of the given path, whereas `path.join` returns the concatenation of multiple path segments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of the given path, whereas `path.join` returns the concatenation of multiple path segments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname` returns the file extension of the given path, whereas `path.join` returns the concatenation of multiple path segments.

DONE.
