 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the '==' operator instead of the strict equality '===' operator, which can lead to unexpected type coercion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the exact value of 'null' instead of checking if the value is 'undefined'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'undefined' === typeof row.val
