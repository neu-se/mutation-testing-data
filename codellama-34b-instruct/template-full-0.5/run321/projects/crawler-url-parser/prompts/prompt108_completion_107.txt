  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the URL of the current URL object, instead of the current URL object itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the hostname of the current URL object, instead of the current URL object itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the path of the current URL object, instead of the current URL object itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
