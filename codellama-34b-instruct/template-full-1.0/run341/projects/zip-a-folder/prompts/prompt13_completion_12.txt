  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ssrc
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `ssrc` is not defined in the code, so this replacement would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"src"
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `src` is a string, and string concatenation is not allowed with the `fs.promises.access()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `undefined` is not defined in the code, so this replacement would cause a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
