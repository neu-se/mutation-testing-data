  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method expects a value to be returned, and returning `null` would cause the promise to be resolved with a `null` value, which is different from the original behavior where the promise is resolved with the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method expects a value to be returned, and returning `undefined` would cause the promise to be resolved with an `undefined` value, which is different from the original behavior where the promise is resolved with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method expects a value to be returned, and throwing an error would cause the promise to be rejected with the error, which is different from the original behavior where the promise is resolved with the original value.

DONE.
