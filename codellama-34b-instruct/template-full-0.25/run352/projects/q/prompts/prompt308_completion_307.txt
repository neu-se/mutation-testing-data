  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will cause the promise to be rejected with the provided error message, whereas `resolve` and `reject` will return a promise with a specific value or error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the provided error message, whereas `resolve` and `reject` are functions that return a promise with a specific value or error.

DONE.
