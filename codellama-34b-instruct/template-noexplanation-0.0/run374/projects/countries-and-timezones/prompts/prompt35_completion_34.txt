  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(input) + 1
```
This change will cause the `getNumStr` function to always return a string that is one character longer than the original string. This may cause issues with the `buildTimezone` function, which relies on the `getNumStr` function to return a specific format for the offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(input) - 1
```
This change will cause the `getNumStr` function to always return a string that is one character shorter than the original string. This may also cause issues with the `buildTimezone` function, as it relies on the `getNumStr` function to return a specific format for the offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(input) * 2
```
This change will cause the `getNumStr` function to always return a string that is twice as long as the original string. This may cause issues with the `
