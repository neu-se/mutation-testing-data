  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `nextOp` object onto the `ops` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code pushes the `nextOp` object onto the `ops` array only if the `nextOp` object is not equal to the `lastOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(lastOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `lastOp` object onto the `ops` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code pushes the `nextOp` object onto the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a `null` value onto the `ops` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code pushes either the `nextOp` object or
