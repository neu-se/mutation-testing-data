 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would not receive the correct promise to handle, potentially causing incorrect handling of the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise as its first argument, and `null` is not a promise. This could cause the code to throw an exception or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise as its first argument, and a function is not a promise. This could cause the code to throw an exception or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
