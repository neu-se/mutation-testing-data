  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(rejection, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function is called with the `rejection` and `reason` arguments, which would cause the unhandled rejection to be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(rejection, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function is called with the `rejection` and `reason` arguments, which would cause the unhandled rejection to be added to the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function is called, which would cause the `unhandledReasons` and `unhandledRejections` arrays to be reset to empty arrays.

DONE.
