 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise object would always have an initial state of `{state: "unknown"}`, even if the promise is already settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return {state: "pending"}; }
