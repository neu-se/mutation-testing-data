  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string 'foo' to the path, which may not be intended and could cause the policy to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the path to uppercase, which could cause the policy to behave differently if the path is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the path, which could cause the policy to behave differently if the path is used to match against a specific pattern.

DONE.
