  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `flush` method, whereas `window` is an object that does have a `flush` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `flush` method, whereas `window` is an object that does have a `flush` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object, which does have a `flush` method, whereas `window` is an object that does have a `flush` method.

DONE.
