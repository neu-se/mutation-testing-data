  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first character of the line and only consider the attributes of the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the attributes of the first character if they exist, and would return an empty object otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes || iter.next(1).attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the attributes of the first character, and if they don't exist, it would consider the attributes of the second character.

DONE.
