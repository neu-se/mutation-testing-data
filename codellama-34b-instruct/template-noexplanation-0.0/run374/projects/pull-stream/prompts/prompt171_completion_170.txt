  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This change will cause the function to return `false` instead of `true`, which will result in the callback being called with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the function to return `null` instead of `true`, which will result in the callback being called with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `true`, which will result in the callback being called with a different value than expected.

DONE.
