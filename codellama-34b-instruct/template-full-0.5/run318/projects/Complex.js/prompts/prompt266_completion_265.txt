  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b, a` would return the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment `a, b` would return the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b, a` would return the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment `a + b` would return the sum of the real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b, a` would return the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment `a - b` would return the difference of the real and imaginary parts.

DONE.
