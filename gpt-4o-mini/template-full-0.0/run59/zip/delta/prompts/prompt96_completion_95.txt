Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the new operation to be inserted one position after the last operation instead of at the correct index, potentially leading to incorrect ordering of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert the new operation at the beginning of the operations array, regardless of the intended position, which could disrupt the intended sequence of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to insert the new operation at the end of the operations array, effectively ignoring the logic that determines the correct insertion point based on the previous operation, which could lead to incorrect operation merging.

DONE.
