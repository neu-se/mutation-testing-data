  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses at the end of the function call would cause the function to be invoked immediately, rather than being passed as a reference to the `nodeify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver
```
This would result in different behavior because the reference to the `makeNodeResolver` function would be passed to the `nodeify` function, rather than the function itself being invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would bind the `makeNodeResolver` function to the `deferred` object, allowing it to be invoked with the correct context.

DONE.
