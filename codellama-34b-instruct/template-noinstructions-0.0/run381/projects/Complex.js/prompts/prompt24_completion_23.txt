  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, which is not the same as the square root of the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the sum of `a` and `b`, which is not the same as the square root of the product of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the product of `a` and `b`, which is not the same as the square root of the sum of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
