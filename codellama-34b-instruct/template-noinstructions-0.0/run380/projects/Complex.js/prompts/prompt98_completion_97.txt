  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I' || tokens[i + 1] === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `tokens[i + 1] === '+'` would cause the code to treat a plus sign as the imaginary unit, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I' || tokens[i + 1] === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `tokens[i + 1] === '-'` would cause the code to treat a minus sign as the imaginary unit, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I' || tokens
