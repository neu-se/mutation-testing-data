  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, causing the condition to be negated, and the text will be added to the URL object even if it already exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method is replaced with `indexOf`, which checks if the substring appears anywhere in the string, and the condition is negated to match the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.startsWith(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method is replaced with `startsWith`, which checks if the substring appears at the beginning of the string, and the condition is negated to match the original behavior.

DONE.
