  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than the end, while the modified code fragment checks if the index is less than or equal to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than the end, while the modified code fragment checks if the index is less than or equal to the end minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than the end, while the modified code fragment checks if the index is less than half the end.

DONE.
