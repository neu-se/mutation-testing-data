  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to use the longitude value of `point2` instead of the latitude value, which will result in a different distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to use the latitude value of `point1` instead of the latitude value of `point2`, which will result in a different distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to use the longitude value of `point1` instead of the latitude value of `point2`, which will result in a different distance calculation.

DONE.
