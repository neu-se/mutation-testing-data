 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.toString.call
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `toString` method from `Object.prototype` to `Function.prototype`, which may return different results for certain objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method from `Object.prototype.toString` to `Object.prototype.apply`, which would throw an error as `apply` expects a context (`this`) and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method from `Object.prototype.toString` to `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`, which would return `false` for all inputs, as the inputs are strings and not objects with own properties.

DONE.
