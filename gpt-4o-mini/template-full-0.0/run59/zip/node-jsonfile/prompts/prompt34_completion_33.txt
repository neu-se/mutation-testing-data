Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'wrongFileName.txt'
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the file name to a specific string, causing the function to always attempt to write to 'wrongFileName.txt' instead of the intended file path provided as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the file argument would likely cause the `fs.writeFile` function to throw an error, as it expects a valid file path, leading to an unhandled exception if not properly caught.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + 'extraData'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 'extraData' to the original file name, potentially causing the function to write to a different file than intended, which could lead to data being saved in an unexpected location.

DONE.
