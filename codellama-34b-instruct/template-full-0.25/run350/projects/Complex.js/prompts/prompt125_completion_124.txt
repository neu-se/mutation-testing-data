  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this code fragment checks if both are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` is infinite or if `z` is not infinite, while this code fragment checks if `this` is infinite or if `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` is not infinite and `z` is infinite, while this code fragment checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is not infinite.

DONE.
