  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the `err` and `data` arguments, while the replaced code fragment `null` is a constant value that does not have a function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the `err` and `data` arguments, while the replaced code fragment `undefined` is a constant value that does not have a function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the `err` and `data` arguments, while the replaced code fragment `function(){}` is a function that does not take any arguments and does not have any side effects.

DONE.
