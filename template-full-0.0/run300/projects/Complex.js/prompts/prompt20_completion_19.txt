  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 3000 || b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are less than 3000, while this replacement checks if either `a` or `b` is greater than 3000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than 3000 and `b` is less than 3000, while this replacement checks if `a` is equal to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than 3000 and `b` is less than 3000, while this replacement checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.

DONE.
