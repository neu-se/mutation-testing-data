  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `delete` are inverse operations, so using `insert` instead of `delete` would cause the inverted delta to have the opposite effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` would keep the same length as the original delta, while `delete` would remove the same length as the original delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(length, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` with an empty attributes object would keep the same length as the original delta, while `delete` would remove the same length as the original delta.

DONE.
