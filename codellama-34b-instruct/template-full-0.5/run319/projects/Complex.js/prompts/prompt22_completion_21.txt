  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is squaring both `a` and `b` before adding them, while this replacement only adds them without squaring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is squaring both `a` and `b` before adding them, while this replacement multiplies them without squaring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is squaring both `a` and `b` before adding them, while this replacement divides `a` by `b` without squaring.

DONE.
