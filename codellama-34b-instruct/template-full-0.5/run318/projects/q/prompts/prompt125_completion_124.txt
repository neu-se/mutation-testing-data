  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object_hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `object_hasOwnProperty` function, causing the `for...in` loop to iterate over all properties of the object, including inherited ones, instead of just the own properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would force the `object_hasOwnProperty` function to be called with the `this` value set to the object being iterated over, instead of the global object. This would cause the function to return `true` for own properties, but `false` for inherited properties, which would affect the behavior of the `for...in` loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.apply(this, [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because
