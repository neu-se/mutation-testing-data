  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with a bound `this` value, which would cause the `uncurryThis` function to be called with a different `this` value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method calls the `uncurryThis` function with a different `this` value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method calls the `uncurryThis` function with a different `this` value than the original code.

DONE.
