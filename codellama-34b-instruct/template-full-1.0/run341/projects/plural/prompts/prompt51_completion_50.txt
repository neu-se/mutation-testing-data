  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/es$/, 'is') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `es` ending with `is`, which would produce an incorrect plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, '') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the `s` ending, which would produce an incorrect plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, 'X') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `s` ending with `X`, which would produce an incorrect plural form.

DONE.
