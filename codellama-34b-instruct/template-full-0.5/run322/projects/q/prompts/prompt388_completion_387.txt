  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function(value) { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would always return the original value, regardless of any modifications made to it in the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function(value) { return value + 1; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would always return the original value plus one, regardless of any modifications made to it in the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function(value) { return value * 2; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would always return the original value multiplied by two, regardless of any modifications made to it in the callback function.

DONE.
