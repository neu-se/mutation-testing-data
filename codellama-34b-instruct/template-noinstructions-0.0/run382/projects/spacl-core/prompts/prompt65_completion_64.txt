  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which means that the new array would contain the same elements as the original array, but any changes made to the new array would not affect the original array. In contrast, the original code fragment `...rules` would spread the elements of the `rules` array into the new array, which means that any changes made to the new array would also affect the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.map((rule) => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array. In this case, the function being called is `clone()`, which creates a deep copy of each `Rule` object in the `rules` array. This means that the new array would contain deep copies of the original `Rule` objects, which would not be affected by any changes made to the new array. In contrast,
