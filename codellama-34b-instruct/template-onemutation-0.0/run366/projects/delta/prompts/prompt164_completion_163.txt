  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is a delete operation, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not a delete operation. This change would cause the algorithm to behave differently when it encounters a delete operation.

DONE.
