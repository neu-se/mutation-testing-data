  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
    return Complex['ZERO'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` is zero or `z` is infinite, but the new code checks if `this` is zero or `z` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()) {
    return Complex['INFINITY'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is zero, but the new code checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
    return Complex['NAN'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this`
