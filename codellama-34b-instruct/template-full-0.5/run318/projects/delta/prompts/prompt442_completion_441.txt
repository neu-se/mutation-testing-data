  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable is used to determine the starting position of the substring, and adding 1 to it would shift the starting position by 1 character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable is used to determine the starting position of the substring, and subtracting 1 from it would shift the starting position by -1 character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable is used to determine the starting position of the substring, and using 0 would start the substring from the beginning of the string.

DONE.
