  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return all timezones, including deprecated ones, instead of only returning non-deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a country object with all timezones, including deprecated ones, instead of only returning non-deprecated timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an array of country objects, instead of an array of country IDs.

DONE.
