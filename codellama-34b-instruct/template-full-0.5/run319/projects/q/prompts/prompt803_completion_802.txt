  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a function that is called with the progress notification, while `null` is a null value that is not callable and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a function that is called with the progress notification, while `undefined` is an undefined value that is not callable and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a function that is called with the progress notification, while `function () {}` is a different function that would be called instead.

DONE.
