Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.includes("internal")
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the line contains the substring "internal" instead of checking if it is an internal frame based on the file name and line number, potentially allowing non-internal frames to be incorrectly identified as internal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the line is empty instead of checking if it is an internal frame, which would cause all non-empty lines to be treated as desired lines, leading to incorrect stack trace filtering.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.startsWith("at ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the line starts with "at " instead of checking for internal frames, which would incorrectly include lines that are not relevant to the internal frame filtering logic.

DONE.
