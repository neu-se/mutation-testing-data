  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, and the promise would not be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with a null argument, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with the promise object as an argument, which would cause the promise to be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
