  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arg` is a value that is passed to the `next` method of the generator, while `null` is not a valid value for the `next` method and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arg` is a value that is passed to the `next` method of the generator, while `undefined` is not a valid value for the `next` method and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arg` is a value that is passed to the `next` method of the generator, while `throw new Error("test")` would cause an error to be thrown instead of passing a value to the `next` method.

DONE.
