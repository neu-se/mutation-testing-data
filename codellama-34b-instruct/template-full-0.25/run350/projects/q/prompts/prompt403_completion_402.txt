  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a method that resolves a promise with a given value, whereas `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with a given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that is called when a promise is resolved or rejected, whereas `thenReject` is a method that is only called when a promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that is called when a promise is resolved or rejected, and the function passed to `then` will be called with the resolved value or the rejected reason. In this case, the function will throw an error with the given reason, which will result in the promise being rejected
