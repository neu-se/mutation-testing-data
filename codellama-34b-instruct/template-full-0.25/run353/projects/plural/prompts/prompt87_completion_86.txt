  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'person'`, which is a singular noun, while the new code fragment is `'people'`, which is a plural noun.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'humans'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'person'`, which is a singular noun, while the new code fragment is `'humans'`, which is a plural noun.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'individuals'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'person'`, which is a singular noun, while the new code fragment is `'individuals'`, which is a plural noun.

DONE.
