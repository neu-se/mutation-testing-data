  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'wrong_name'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would create a timezone object with the wrong name, which could lead to errors in the application's timezone management.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive an undefined value instead of a valid name, which could cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a numeric value instead of a name, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
