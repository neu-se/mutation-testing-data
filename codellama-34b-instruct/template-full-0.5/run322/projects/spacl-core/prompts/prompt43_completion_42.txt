  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always flatten the path, even if it's not the final segment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would never flatten the path, even if it's the final segment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(min > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only flatten the path if the minimum number of segments is greater than 0.

DONE.
