  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the constant 10, while the new code fragment is using the result of the square root of 10.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the constant 10, while the new code fragment is using the mathematical constant pi.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the constant 10, while the new code fragment is using the mathematical constant e.

DONE.
