 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the invert() method would throw an error when trying to access the `invert` method of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would treat the `retain` property as an array, which would lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number, which would cause the `invert` method to produce inconsistent results each time it is called.

DONE.
