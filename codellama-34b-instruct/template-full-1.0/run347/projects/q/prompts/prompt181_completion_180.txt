  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/i.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression makes the match case-insensitive, which would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.test` method would return a boolean value indicating whether the regular expression matches the string, rather than returning the matched groups.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/g.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression makes the match global, which would return an array of all matches in the string, rather
