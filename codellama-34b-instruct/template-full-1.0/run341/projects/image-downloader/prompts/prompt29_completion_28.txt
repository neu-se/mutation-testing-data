  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http:'
```
This would result in different behavior because `http:` is not the same as `https`. The `http:` protocol uses plain HTTP, which may not be as secure as HTTPS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because `http://` is not the same as `https`. The `http://` protocol uses plain HTTP, which may not be as secure as HTTPS.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because `ftp://` is not the same as `https`. The `ftp://` protocol uses the File Transfer Protocol, which is not secure and may not work with this code.

DONE.
