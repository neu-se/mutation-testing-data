  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall(<PLACEHOLDER>).then(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would be executed unconditionally, regardless of the result of the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall(<PLACEHOLDER>).then(function (value) {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would only be executed if the `callback` function returned a truthy value.

```
return callback.fcall(<PLACEHOLDER>).then(function (value) {
    if (value) {
        throw reason;
    }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would only be executed if the `callback` function returned a truthy value, and the `reason
