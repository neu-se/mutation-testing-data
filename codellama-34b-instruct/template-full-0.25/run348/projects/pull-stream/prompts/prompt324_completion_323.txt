  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true` or `false`, while this replacement checks if it's `false` or `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true` or `false`, while this replacement checks if it's `true` or `null`.

DONE.
