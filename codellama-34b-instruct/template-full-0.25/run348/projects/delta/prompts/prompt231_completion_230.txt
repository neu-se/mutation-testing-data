  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` method to return a value that is larger than the actual length of the iterable, potentially causing the `next()` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` method to return a value that is smaller than the actual length of the iterable, potentially causing the `next()` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` method to return a value that is larger than the actual length of the iterable, potentially causing the `next()` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
