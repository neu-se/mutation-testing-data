  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator will add 1 to the `read` value, which may change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator will subtract 1 from the `read` value, which may change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator will multiply the `read` value by 2, which may change the output of the function.

DONE.
