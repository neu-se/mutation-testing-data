  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the iterator by `length` instead of just 1, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the iterator by `length` instead of just 1, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only increment the iterator by 1, potentially leaving out important operations.

DONE.
