  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let array = [1, 2, 3];
array_slice(array);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire array instead of the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let array = [1, 2, 3];
array_reduce(array);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of all array elements instead of the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let array = [1, 2, 3];
array_indexOf(array, 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the first element that satisfies the provided test function, which is not the same as the first element in the array.

DONE.
