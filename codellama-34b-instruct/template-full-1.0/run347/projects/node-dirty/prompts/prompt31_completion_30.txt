  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rm` method takes a different number of arguments than `set`, and the `remove` method only removes the value associated with the specified key, whereas the `set` method updates or inserts a value in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is used to retrieve the value associated with a key, whereas the `set` method updates or inserts a value in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.update
```
This would result in different behavior because the `update` method updates the value associated with a key, whereas the `set` method updates or inserts a value in the database.

DONE.
