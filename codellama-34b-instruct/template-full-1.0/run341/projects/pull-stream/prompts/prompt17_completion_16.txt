  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, read)
```
This would result in an infinite loop because `read` is being called recursively without any checks to prevent it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0])
```
This would result in an infinite loop because `ref[0]` is being passed in as the first argument to `pull`, which will then call `pull(read, ref[0])` again, causing the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[1])
```
This would result in an infinite loop because `ref[1]` is being passed in as the second argument to `pull`, which will then call `pull(read, ref[1])` again, causing the loop.

DONE.
