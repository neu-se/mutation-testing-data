  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the length to be off by one, potentially causing issues with the logic that follows.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the length to be off by one, potentially causing issues with the logic that follows.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the length to be doubled, potentially causing issues with the logic that follows.

DONE.
