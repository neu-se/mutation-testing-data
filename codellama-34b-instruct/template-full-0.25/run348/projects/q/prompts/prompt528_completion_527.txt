  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound `this` value, which would cause the `inspect` method to be called on a different object than the one passed to `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a specified `this` value and arguments, which would cause the `inspect` method to be called on a different object than the one passed to `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a specified `this` value and an array of arguments, which would cause the `inspect` method to be called on a different object than the one passed to `Q`.

DONE.
