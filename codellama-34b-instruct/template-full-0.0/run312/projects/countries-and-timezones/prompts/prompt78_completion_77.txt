  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the timezone object, rather than the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `timezones` property of the timezone object, rather than the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.countries
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `countries` property of the timezone object, rather than the object itself.

DONE.
