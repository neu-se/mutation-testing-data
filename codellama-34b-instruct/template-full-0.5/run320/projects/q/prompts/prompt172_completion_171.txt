  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.indexOf("(node.js:") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both "module.js" and "node.js", but this replacement only checks for "node.js".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.indexOf("(node.js:") !== -1 || stackLine.indexOf("(module.js:") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both "module.js" and "node.js", but this replacement checks for "node.js" twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.indexOf("(module.js:") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both "module.js" and "node.js", but this replacement only checks for "module.js".

DONE.
