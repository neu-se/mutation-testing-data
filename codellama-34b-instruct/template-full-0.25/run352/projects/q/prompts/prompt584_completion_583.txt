  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with the `exception` object, which would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the exception was caught and handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would be called with the `result.value` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the `result.value` property, even if the `result` object was not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return when(result.value, callback, errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would be called with the `result.value` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the `result.value` property, even if the `result` object was not a promise. Additionally, the `callback
