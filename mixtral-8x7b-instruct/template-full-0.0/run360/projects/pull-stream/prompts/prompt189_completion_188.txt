 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current value at the index `i` without incrementing the index, causing an infinite loop if the current value is not null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next value in the array, skipping the current value and potentially causing unexpected behavior if the current value is not null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the index `i` before returning null, causing the loop to skip the current value and potentially causing unexpected behavior if the current value is not null or undefined.

DONE.
