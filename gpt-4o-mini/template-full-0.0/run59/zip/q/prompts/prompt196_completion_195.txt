Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call `toUpperCase()` on the result of `getFileNameAndLineNumber`, which would lead to a TypeError if the result is `null` or `undefined`, instead of returning the expected array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine) || ["unknown", 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it defaults to returning an array with "unknown" and 0 if `getFileNameAndLineNumber` returns `null` or `undefined`, which could lead to incorrect filtering of stack traces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine).slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only retrieves the first element of the array returned by `getFileNameAndLineNumber`, discarding the line number, which would cause the internal frame check to fail incorrectly.

DONE.
