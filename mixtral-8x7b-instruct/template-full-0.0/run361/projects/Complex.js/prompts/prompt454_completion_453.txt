 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNaN(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `true`, while the original code checks if the `re` and `im` properties of the current complex number are `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isNaN()
