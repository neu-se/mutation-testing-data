  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `key` variable, which is a string, and returns the string itself. This would cause the `JSON.stringify()` method to be called on a string, which would result in a different JSON string being written to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method is called on the `key` variable, which is a string, and returns the uppercase version of the string. This would cause the `JSON.stringify()` method to be called on a string, which would result in a different JSON string being written to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is accessed on the `key` variable, which is a string, and returns the length of the string. This would cause
