  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array. But because the placeholder is used in the `Promise.prototype.fbind` method, changing the original code would not result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.slice()` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array. But because the placeholder is used in the `Promise.prototype.fbind` method, changing the original code would not result in different behavior.
