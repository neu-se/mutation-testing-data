  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if `end` is false, while this new code fragment calls it regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the original `data` value to the `cb` function, while this new code fragment passes a modified `data` value that is one greater than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the original `data` value to the `cb` function, while this new code fragment passes a null value.

DONE.
