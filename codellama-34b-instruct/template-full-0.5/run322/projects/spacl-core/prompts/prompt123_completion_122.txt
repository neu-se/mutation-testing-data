  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.props
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.regex.props` is a different property than `this.regex` and would change the way the `matches` method works.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.source
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.regex.source` is a different property than `this.regex` and would change the way the `matches` method works.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.flags
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.regex.flags` is a different property than `this.regex` and would change the way the `matches` method works.

DONE.
