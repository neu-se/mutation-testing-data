  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called instead of the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error is thrown instead of the `reject` function being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', (err) => console.error(err))
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is not propagated to the promise, but instead it is handled by the `output` stream.

DONE.
