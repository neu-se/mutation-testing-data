 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides by the result of `cosh(2 * b) + Math.cos(2 * a)`, while the modified code fragment would divide by 1, which would not have the same effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides by the result of `cosh(2 * b) + Math.cos(2 * a)`, while the modified code fragment would divide by `b * b`, which would not have the same effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides by the result of `cosh(2 * b) + Math.cos(2 * a)`, while the modified code fragment would divide by a random number, which would not have the same effect.

DONE
