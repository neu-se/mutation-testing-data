  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function is not called, and the promise is not resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function is not called, and the promise is not resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(noop, noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function is not called, and the promise is not resolved or rejected.

DONE.
