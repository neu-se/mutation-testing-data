  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the index is negative, which is not the intended behavior of the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue only if the index is equal to zero, which is not the intended behavior of the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue only if the index is even, which is not the intended behavior of the loop.

DONE.
