  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method expects an array as its last argument, and passing `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method expects an array as its last argument, and passing an empty object would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method expects an array as its last argument, and passing an empty array would cause an error.

DONE.
