  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `aborted`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `aborted` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would return `false` if `aborted` is `false`, regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err || aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would return `true` if either `err` or `aborted` is `true`, regardless of the value of the other variable.

DONE.
