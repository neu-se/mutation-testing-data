  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `promise` object instead of the `resolvedPromise` object, which could potentially cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(this)

This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `this` object instead of the `resolvedPromise` object, which could potentially cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `null` object instead of the `resolvedPromise` object, which could potentially cause the promise to be resolved with a
