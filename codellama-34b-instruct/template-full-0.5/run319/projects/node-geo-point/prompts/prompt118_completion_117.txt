  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-distance
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the distance to be calculated in the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculated distance would be increased by 100 meters, which would affect the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculated distance would be doubled, which would affect the destination point.

DONE.
