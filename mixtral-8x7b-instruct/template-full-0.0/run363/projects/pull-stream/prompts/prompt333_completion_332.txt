 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is being called with only the `end` argument, while in the original code, `cb` is being called with both `end` and `data` arguments. This could cause issues if the test suite expects `cb` to be called with both arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && op(data, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is being called with both `data` and `cb` arguments, while in the original code, `op` is being called with only `data` argument. This could cause issues if `op` is not designed to handle two arguments or if the test suite expects `op` to be called with only one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.console.log(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is being logged to the console instead
