  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback === undefined` would be `false` if `callback` is `null`, while `callback !== null` would be `true` in both cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback === undefined` would be `true` if `callback` is `undefined`, while `typeof callback === "function"` would be `false` in both cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback === undefined` would be `true` if `callback` is `undefined`, while `callback instanceof Function` would be `false` in both cases.

DONE.
