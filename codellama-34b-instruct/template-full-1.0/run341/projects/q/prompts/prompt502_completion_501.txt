  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which can cause unexpected behavior when the array is mutated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.concat()` creates a new array that contains the elements of the original array, which can cause unexpected behavior when the array is mutated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array that contains the elements of the original array and uses square bracket notation to indicate that it is an array literal, which can cause unexpected behavior when the array is mutated.

DONE.
