  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `ended` and `end` are truthy, while the mutated code checks if `ended` is falsy or `end` is truthy. This change would cause the function to terminate the stream earlier or later than intended, depending on the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `ended` is truthy and `end` is falsy, while the mutated code checks if both are truthy. This change would cause the function to terminate the stream earlier or later than intended, depending on the input values.
