  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects a `this` argument to be passed as the first parameter, whereas `apply` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with the `this` context set to the first argument, whereas `apply` and `call` do not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is passed as the `this` context, whereas the original code passes `resolvedPromise` as the `this` context.

DONE.
