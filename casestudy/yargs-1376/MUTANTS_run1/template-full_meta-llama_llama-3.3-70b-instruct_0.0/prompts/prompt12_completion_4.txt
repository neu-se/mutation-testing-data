Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config, 'extend'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the property name being checked from 'extends' to 'extend', potentially allowing configurations with an 'extend' property to bypass the extending logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defaultConfig, 'extends'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the 'extends' property on the defaultConfig object instead of the config object, potentially causing infinite recursion or incorrect extending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config, 'extends' === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to always be false, since 'extends' is a string and can never be equal to true, effectively disabling the extending logic.

DONE.
