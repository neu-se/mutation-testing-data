  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` variable is not defined in the current scope, so it would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value, but it would cause the `all` function to return `null` instead of a promise, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a valid value, but it would cause the `all` function to return a rejected promise, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
