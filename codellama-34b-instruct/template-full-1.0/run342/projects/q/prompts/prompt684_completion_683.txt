  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is an array-like object containing the values of the arguments passed to a function, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, whereas `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
