  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `stack` property of the `error` object with a new string value, which would change the output of the `filterStackString` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `stack` property of the `error` object to null, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to return an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `stack` property of the `error` object to undefined, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to return an empty string.

DONE.
