  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `r + Math.abs(b)` would always be positive, while `r` could be negative, making the `sqrt` function return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r - Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `r - Math.abs(b)` would always be negative, while `r` could be positive, making the `sqrt` function return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(r) + Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(r) + Math.abs(b)` would always be positive, while `r` could be negative, making the `sqrt` function return a different value.

DONE.
