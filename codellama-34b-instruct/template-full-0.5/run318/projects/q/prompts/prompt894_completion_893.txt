  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function, and `array_slice.call(arguments)` would return an array with the arguments object as its only element, rather than an array of the arguments object's elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice()` would return a shallow copy of the arguments object, rather than an array of the arguments object's elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice.call(arguments)` would return an array with the arguments object's elements, rather than an array with the arguments object as its only element.

DONE.
