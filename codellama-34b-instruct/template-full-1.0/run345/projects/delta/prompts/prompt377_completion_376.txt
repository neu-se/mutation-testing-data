  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLine
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLine` is not a valid method of `OpIterator`, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType && otherIter.peekType !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `otherIter.peekType !== 'insert'` would exclude `insert` actions from the condition, potentially causing erroneous behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekNumber
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekNumber` is not a valid method of `OpIterator`, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
