  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `spread` would be called with the resolved value of the promise, rather than the rejected reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value that could be passed to `spread`, and it would be passed as the second argument to the callback function, rather than the rejected reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value that could be passed to `spread`, and it would be passed as the second argument to the callback function, rather than the rejected reason.

DONE.
