  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!options.url` check would pass if `options.url` is `undefined`, while the `options.url === undefined` check would only pass if `options.url` is `undefined` or `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url && options.url !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!options.url` check would pass if `options.url` is `undefined`, while the `!options.url && options.url !== ''` check would only pass if `options.url` is `undefined` or an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url !== undefined && options.url !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!options.url` check would pass if `options.url` is `undefined` or `null`, while the `options.url !== undefined && options.
