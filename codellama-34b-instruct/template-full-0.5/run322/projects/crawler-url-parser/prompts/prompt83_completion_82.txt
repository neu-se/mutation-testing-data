  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `href` attribute of the current element, which may not be the same as the `href` attribute of the `<a>` element being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `href` attribute of the first `<a>` element within the current element, which may not be the same as the `href` attribute of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).closest('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `href` attribute of the closest ancestor `<a>` element, which may not be the same as the `href` attribute of the current element.

DONE.
