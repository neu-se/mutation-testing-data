  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This change will cause the `compose` function to always return the first argument, regardless of the value of the `keepNull` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This change will cause the `compose` function to always return the second argument, regardless of the value of the `keepNull` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && b
```
This change will cause the `compose` function to return the result of the `&&` operator, which will be either `a` or `b`, depending on the value of the `keepNull` parameter.

DONE.
