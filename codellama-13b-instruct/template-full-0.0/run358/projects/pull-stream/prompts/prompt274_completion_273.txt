  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function is called with the `stream` argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment. The `once` function is used to wrap a stream in a way that it can only be read once, and the `stream` argument is a stream that is being flattened. In the original code fragment, the `once` function is called without any arguments, which means that it will wrap the current stream in a way that it can only be read once. In the modified code fragment, the `once` function is called with the `stream` argument, which means that it will wrap the `stream` argument in a way that it can only be read once. This could result in different behavior if the `stream` argument is not the same as the current stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(stream, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function is called with the `stream` argument and the `true`
