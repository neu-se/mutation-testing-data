 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because the indexOf function would always return -1, as the second argument is treated as the position to start the search, and Infinity is not a valid position. This would cause the code to always treat the newline as if it were not found, potentially causing incorrect line handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the indexOf function would always return -1, as the second argument is the position to start the search, and -1 is treated as the start from the end. This would cause the code to always treat the newline as if it were not found, potentially causing incorrect line handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert.indexOf('not-a-newline', 0)
```
This would
