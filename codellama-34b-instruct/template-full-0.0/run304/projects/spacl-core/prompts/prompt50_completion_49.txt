  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `part` string starting from the second character, rather than the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `part` string starting from the last character, rather than the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `part` string starting from the first character and ending at the second-to-last character, rather than the entire string.

DONE.
