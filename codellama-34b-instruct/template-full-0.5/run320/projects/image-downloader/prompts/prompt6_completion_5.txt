  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is not required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code would not throw an error if `options.dest` is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required, but it is not provided')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code would throw an error if `options.dest` is not provided, but the error message would be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required, but it is not provided')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code would throw an error if `options.dest` is not provided, but the error message would be different from the original code.

DONE.
