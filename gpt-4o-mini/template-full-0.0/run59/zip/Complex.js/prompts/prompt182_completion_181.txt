Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the exponent is equal to 1 instead of checking if it is zero, which would lead to incorrect handling of the case when the exponent is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the exponent is equal to the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of checking if it is zero, which would lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the real part of the exponent is negative instead of checking if it is zero, which would affect the calculation of the power for negative exponents incorrectly.

DONE.
