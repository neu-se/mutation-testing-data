  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `parser_exit` function call, and the new code fragment includes it with an argument of `1`, which would cause the program to exit with an error code of `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `parser_exit` function call, and the new code fragment includes it with an argument of `0`, which would cause the program to exit with an error code of `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `parser_exit` function call, and the new code fragment includes it with an argument of `2`, which would cause the program to exit with an error code of `2`.

DONE.
