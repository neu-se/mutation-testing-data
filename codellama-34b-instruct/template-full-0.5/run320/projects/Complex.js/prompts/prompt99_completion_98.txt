  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(c + '1')
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `1` would cause the `parseFloat` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(c + 'a')
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `a` would cause the `parseFloat` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parseInt` function would return a different value than `parseFloat`, potentially leading to incorrect calculations and results.

DONE.
