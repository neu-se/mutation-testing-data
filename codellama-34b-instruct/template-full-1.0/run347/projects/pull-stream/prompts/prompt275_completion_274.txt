  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stream` variable is a stream object, and adding 1 to it would not have any effect on the stream, while the original code fragment would return the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new stream object that is a slice of the original stream, while the original code fragment would return the original stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying a stream object by 2 would not have any effect on the stream, while the original code fragment would return the stream.

DONE.
