  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` is a method that returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` without the parentheses would return the function itself, which is not what we want.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is a different iterator than `thisIter`, so `peekType` would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for `peekType`, so the code would throw an error.

DONE.
