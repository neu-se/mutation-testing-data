  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is not defined in the given code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause the code to exit with an error, whereas `flush` would continue executing the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("flush")
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` would output the string "flush" to the console, whereas `flush` would continue executing the code.

DONE.
