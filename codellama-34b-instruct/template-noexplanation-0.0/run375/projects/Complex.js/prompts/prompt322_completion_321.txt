  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value than it would have with the original code fragment, potentially leading to a failure in the `asin` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value than it would have with the original code fragment, potentially leading to a failure in the `acos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value than it would have with the original code fragment, potentially leading to a failure in the `atan` function.

DONE.
