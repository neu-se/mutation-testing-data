  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('.base')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `$()` function is not intended to be used with a `Map` object, and would likely cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('.base')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `$()` returns an array of elements, and the `[0]` index would access the first element of the array, which might not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('.base').map(function() { return this; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` is not intended to be used with a `Map` object, and would likely cause a runtime error.

DONE.
