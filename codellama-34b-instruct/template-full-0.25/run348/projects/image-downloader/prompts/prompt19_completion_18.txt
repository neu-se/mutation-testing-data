  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options.dest` path is not absolute, while this replacement checks if it is absolute. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options.dest` path is not absolute, while this replacement checks if both the `options.dest` and `options.url` paths are not absolute. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest) || path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options.dest` path is not absolute
