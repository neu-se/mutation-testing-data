  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `.` operator, which would result in a different string concatenation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `dest` string to lowercase, which would result in a different file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because a hardcoded string `"foo"` would be used instead of the `dest` variable, which would result in a different file name.

DONE.
