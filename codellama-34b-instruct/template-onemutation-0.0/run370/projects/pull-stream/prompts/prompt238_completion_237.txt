  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the wrong arguments. The original code fragment calls `cb` with `end` and `data`, but the new code fragment calls it with `end` and `data` again, which is a no-op. This change would cause the test suite to pass even if the `filter` function is not working correctly.

DONE.
