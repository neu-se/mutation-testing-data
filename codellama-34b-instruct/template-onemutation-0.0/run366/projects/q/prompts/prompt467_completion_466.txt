  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an event with the `process` object, while the replaced code fragment emits an event with the `process` object and the `unhandledReasons` array.

DONE.
