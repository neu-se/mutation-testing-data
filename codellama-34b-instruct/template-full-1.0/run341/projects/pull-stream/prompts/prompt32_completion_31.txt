  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument is increased by 1, which would change the behavior of the `pull` function when it is called with more than 4 arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument is decreased by 1, which would change the behavior of the `pull` function when it is called with more than 4 arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument is changed to `null`, which would cause the `pull` function to throw an error when it is called with more than 4 arguments.
