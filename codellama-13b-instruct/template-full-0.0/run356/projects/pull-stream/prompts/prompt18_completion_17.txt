  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `,` operator, which would cause the `pull` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator is used instead of the `,` operator, which would cause the `pull` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator is used instead of the `,` operator, which would cause the `pull` function to return a different value.

DONE.
