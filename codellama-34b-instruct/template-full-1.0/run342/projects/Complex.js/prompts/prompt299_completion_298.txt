  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin()` and `Math.cos()` have different output values for the same input values, but the `Complex` class uses the result of `Math.cos()` in its calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number, which is different from the result of `Math.cos()` for negative inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
Math.max(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max()` returns the larger of the two input values, which is different from the result of `Math.cos()` for inputs with different absolute values.

DONE.
