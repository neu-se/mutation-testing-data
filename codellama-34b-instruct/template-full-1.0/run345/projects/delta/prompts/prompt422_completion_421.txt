  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - index
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `index` variable is being subtracted from `offset`, but in this replacement, `offset` is being subtracted from `index`. This would cause the `index` variable to decrease, which could potentially throw off the rest of the code in the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `index` variable is being subtracted from `offset`, but in this replacement, `index - offset + 1` is being subtracted from `offset`. This would cause the `offset` variable to decrease by one less than in the original code, which could potentially throw off the rest of the code in the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `index` variable is being subtracted from
