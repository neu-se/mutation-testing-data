  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments starting from the second one, instead of passing all the arguments as-is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.concat(args)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments twice, instead of passing them once as-is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments in reverse order, instead of passing them as-is.

DONE.
