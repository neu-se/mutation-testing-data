  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the value of the `val` property of the `row` object, while this modified code fragment adds 1 to that value before returning it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the value of the `val` property of the `row` object, while this modified code fragment multiplies that value by 2 before returning it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the value of the `val` property of the `row` object, while this modified code fragment subtracts 1 from that value before returning it.

DONE.
