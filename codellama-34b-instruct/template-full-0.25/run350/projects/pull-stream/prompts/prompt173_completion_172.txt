  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `Array.isArray(array)`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `array` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is not necessarily the same as the number of elements in the array. For example, an array with a single element that is an empty array would have a `length` of 1, but the number of elements in the array would be 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.some(function(element) { return element === undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `some` method would return `true` if any element in the array is `undefined`, which is not necessarily the same as checking if the array is empty
