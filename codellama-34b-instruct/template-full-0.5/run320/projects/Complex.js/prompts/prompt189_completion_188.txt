  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to zero. This change in the condition would cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to zero. This change in the condition would cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks if `a` plus `b` is not equal to zero. This change in the condition would cause the code to take
