  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in a && 'phi' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now performed on variable `b` instead of `a`, which could lead to a different result in the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in b && 'phi' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now performed on variable `b` instead of `a`, which could lead to a different result in the `if` statement.

DONE.
