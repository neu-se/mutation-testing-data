  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw new Error("This is a bug");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return "This is a bug";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a string value, causing the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return Promise.reject("This is a bug");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a rejected promise, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
