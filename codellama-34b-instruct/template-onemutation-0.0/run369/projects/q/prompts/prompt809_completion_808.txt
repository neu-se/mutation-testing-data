  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `callback` is falsy or if `callback.apply` is not a function, while the new code fragment only checks if `callback.apply` is a function. If `callback` is truthy but does not have an `apply` method, the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` and the `throw` statement would be executed, while the new code fragment would evaluate to `false` and the `throw` statement would not be executed.
