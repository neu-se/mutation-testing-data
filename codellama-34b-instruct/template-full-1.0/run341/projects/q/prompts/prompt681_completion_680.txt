  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `void 0` as the context for the method invocation, while this replacement uses `name`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `apply` method with a context of `void 0` and an array of arguments, while this replacement uses the `call` method with a different context and a single argument that is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `apply` method with a context of `void 0` and an array of arguments, while this replacement uses the `post` method with a different context and an array of arguments.

DONE.
