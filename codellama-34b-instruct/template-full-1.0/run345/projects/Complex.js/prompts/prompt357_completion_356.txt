  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function takes a single parameter, but the code fragment `1` does not have any parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function outputs a positive value, but the code fragment `-cosh` outputs a negative value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function and `cosh` function have different behavior for complex numbers.

DONE.
