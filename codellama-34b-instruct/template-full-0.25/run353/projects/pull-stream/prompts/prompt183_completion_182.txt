  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand, whereas the `>=` operator checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand. In this case, the `>` operator would cause the function to return `null` instead of the next element in the array when `i` is equal to `array.length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand, whereas the `>=` operator checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand. In this case, the `<` operator would cause the function to return the next element in the array when `i` is less than `array.length`, instead of returning `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == array.
