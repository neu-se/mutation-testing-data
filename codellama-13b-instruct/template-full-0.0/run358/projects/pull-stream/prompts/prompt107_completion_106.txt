  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would be called with an `undefined` argument instead of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would be called with an `undefined` argument instead of `done`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would be called with the `done` argument instead of `null`.

DONE.
