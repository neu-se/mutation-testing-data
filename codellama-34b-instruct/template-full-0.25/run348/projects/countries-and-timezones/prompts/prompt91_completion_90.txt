  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(undefined, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getCountry` function with `undefined` as the `id` parameter, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of a country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(null, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getCountry` function with `null` as the `id` parameter, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of a country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(0, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getCountry` function with `0` as the `id` parameter, which would cause the function to return the first country in the `data.countries` object, instead of the country with the specified `id`.

DONE.
