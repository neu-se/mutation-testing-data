Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace carriage return characters (`\r`) instead of newline characters (`\n`), potentially altering the output format of the string representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n\s*/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace newline characters followed by any whitespace characters, which could lead to unexpected formatting in the output string, especially if the original string had trailing spaces after newlines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n\n/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace consecutive newline characters with a single newline, which could change the structure of the output string, especially if the original string had multiple newlines in succession.

DONE.
