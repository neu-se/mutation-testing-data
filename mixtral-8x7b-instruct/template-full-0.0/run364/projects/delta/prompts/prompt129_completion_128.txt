 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next || function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a falsy value (a no-op function) that would bypass the conditional check and always push an undefined value to the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.skip
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.skip` is not a valid method, and it would throw a `TypeError` when attempting to execute it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek` returns the next operation without consuming it, causing an infinite loop in the `while` loop.

DONE.
