  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different from the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'e' + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a concatenation of two strings, whereas the original string is a single string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'e' * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a multiplication of two strings, whereas the original string is a single string.

DONE.
