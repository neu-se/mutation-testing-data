  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this code checks if the string "undefined" is equal to the string "undefined".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this code checks if it is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this code checks if it is equal to the value `undefined`.

DONE.
