  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation to the `ops` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code only pushes the next operation if it is not an insert operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the `ops` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code only pushes the new operation if it is not an insert operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(lastOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the last operation to the `ops` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code only pushes the last operation if it is not an insert operation.

DONE.
