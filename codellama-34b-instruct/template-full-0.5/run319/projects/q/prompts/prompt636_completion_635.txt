  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that rejects a promise with a reason, whereas `dispatch` is a method that dispatches a message to a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise that resolves or rejects based on the outcome of the promise it is called on, whereas `dispatch` is a method that dispatches a message to a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that returns a promise that resolves or rejects based on the outcome of the promise it is called on, whereas `dispatch` is a method that dispatches a message to a promise.

DONE.
