  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return false, regardless of the value of the `abort` parameter. In the original code, the function would return true if `abort` is not null or undefined, and false otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the negation of the `value` parameter, rather than the value itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would compare the `value` parameter to null, rather than checking if it is null or undefined.

DONE.
