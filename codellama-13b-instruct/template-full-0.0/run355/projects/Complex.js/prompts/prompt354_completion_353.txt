  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a + 1` is not equivalent to `a` in all cases. For example, if `a` is a negative number, then `a + 1` would be a positive number, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a - 1` is not equivalent to `a` in all cases. For example, if `a` is a positive number, then `a - 1` would be a negative number, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a * 2` is not equivalent to `a` in all cases. For example, if `a` is a negative number, then `a * 2` would be a
