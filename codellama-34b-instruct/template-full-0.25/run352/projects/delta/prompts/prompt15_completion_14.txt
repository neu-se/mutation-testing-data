  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null` would check if `a` is null, whereas the original code `typeof a !== 'object'` checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== b` would check if `a` is not equal to `b`, whereas the original code `typeof a !== 'object'` checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a
```
This would result in different behavior because `!a` would check if `a` is falsey, whereas the original code `typeof a !== 'object'` checks if `a` is not an object.

DONE.
