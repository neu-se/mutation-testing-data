  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` is a method that iterates over the elements of an array, while `unshift` is a method that adds elements to the beginning of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in an array, while `unshift` is a method that adds elements to the beginning of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` is a method that removes the last element of an array and returns it, while `unshift` is a method that adds elements to the beginning of an array.

DONE.
