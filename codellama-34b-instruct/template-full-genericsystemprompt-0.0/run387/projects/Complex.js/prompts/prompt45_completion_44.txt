  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the type of `a`, while this new code fragment adds `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the type of `a`, while this new code fragment multiplies `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the type of `a`, while this new code fragment divides `a` by `b`.

DONE.
