  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `parser_exit()` with no arguments, while this replacement uses `parser_exit()` with the argument `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `parser_exit()` with no arguments, while this replacement uses `parser_exit()` with the argument `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a + b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `parser_exit()` with no arguments, while this replacement uses `parser_exit()` with the argument `a + b`.

DONE.
