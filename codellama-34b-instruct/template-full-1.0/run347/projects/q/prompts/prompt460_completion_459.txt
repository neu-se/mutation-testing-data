  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the unhandled rejection to be reported even if it has already been handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the unhandled rejection to be handled even if it has not been handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof at === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the unhandled rejection to be handled if `at` is a number, rather than a boolean.

DONE.
