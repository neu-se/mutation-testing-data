Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `null` to the `matches` method, potentially causing it to behave incorrectly if it relies on the context for its logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of the expected `ctx` could lead to unexpected results in the `matches` method, especially if it checks for the presence of properties on the context object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always indicate that the path matches the policy, regardless of the actual context or path being checked, leading to incorrect authorization decisions.

DONE.
