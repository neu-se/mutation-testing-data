  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === null
```
This code fragment checks if the `map` variable is null, which is different from the original code fragment `!map` which checks if the `map` variable is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length === 0
```
This code fragment checks if the `map` variable has a length of 0, which is different from the original code fragment `!map` which checks if the `map` variable is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.size === 0
```
This code fragment checks if the `map` variable has a size of 0, which is different from the original code fragment `!map` which checks if the `map` variable is falsy.

DONE.
