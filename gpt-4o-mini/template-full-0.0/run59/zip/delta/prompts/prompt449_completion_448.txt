Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.delete` is `undefined` instead of checking if it is a number, which would cause the method to incorrectly classify operations that have a `delete` property set to `0` as not being of type 'delete'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.delete` is a string instead of a number, which would lead to all operations with a numeric `delete` property being misclassified as not being of type 'delete'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.delete` is greater than `0`, which would exclude operations with a `delete` value of `0` from being classified as 'delete', potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations that are intended to delete nothing.

DONE.
