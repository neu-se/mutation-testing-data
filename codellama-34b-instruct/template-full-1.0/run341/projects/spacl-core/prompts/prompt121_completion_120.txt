  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(this.regex, ''), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the path matching mechanism to use `String.prototype.replace()` instead of `String.prototype.match()`, which could produce different results if the regular expression contains capturing groups.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the context object from the `query()` method, which could cause the `matches()` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a copy of the context object using `Array.prototype.slice()`, which could cause the `matches()` method to return a different value.

DONE.
