  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` would replace the `delete` operation with a `retain` operation, causing the transformed delta to have a different set of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.push` would add the `delete` operation to the end of the delta, causing the transformed delta to have a different order of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` would delete the `delete` operation, causing the transformed delta to have a different set of operations.

DONE.
