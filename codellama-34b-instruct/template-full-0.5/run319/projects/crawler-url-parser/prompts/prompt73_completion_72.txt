  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is not a valid attribute for an `a` tag, and the code would attempt to parse the value of the `src` attribute as a URL, which would likely result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to parse the value of the `href` attribute plus the string `'foo'`, which would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' + '?' + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to parse the value of the `href` attribute plus the string `'?foo'`, which would likely result in an error.

DONE.
