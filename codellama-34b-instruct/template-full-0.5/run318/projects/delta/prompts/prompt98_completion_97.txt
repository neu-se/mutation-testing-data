  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 'foo';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of `newOp` would be set to a string value `'foo'`, which is different from the original code where it is set to the value of the `arg` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property of `newOp` would be set to `0`, which means that the `delete` operation would not be performed, even if it should be based on the value of the `length` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `newOp` would be set to `-1`, which is not a valid value for the `retain` property. This would cause an error to be thrown when the `push` method is called
