 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of all enumerable properties of the current object, not an empty array. This change would cause the `keys()` method to return an array of keys of the current object's properties instead of an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, not an array. This change would cause the `all()` and `any()` methods to fail when they expect an array as input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a function that always returns the value `42`, not an array. This change would cause the `all()` and `any()` methods to fail when they expect an array as input.

DONE.
