  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_flush` method immediately, rather than waiting for the `drain` event to be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_flush` method with the `force` parameter set to `true`, which would cause the method to flush the queue even if the `drain` event has not been emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_flush` method with the `force` parameter set to `false`, which would cause the method to only flush the queue if the `drain` event has been emitted.

DONE.
