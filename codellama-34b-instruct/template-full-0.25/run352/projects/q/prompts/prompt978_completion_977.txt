  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the node resolver to the `nodeArgs` array, which is then used as an argument to the `dispatch` method. However, the modified code fragment does not push the node resolver to the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the `dispatch` method to receive incorrect arguments and behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver() + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the node resolver to the `nodeArgs` array, which is then used as an argument to the `dispatch` method. However, the modified code fragment pushes the node resolver plus 1 to the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the `dispatch` method to receive incorrect arguments and behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.
