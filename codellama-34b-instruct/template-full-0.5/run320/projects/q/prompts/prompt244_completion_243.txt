  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect = function () {
    if (!resolvedPromise) {
        return { state: "pending" };
    }
    return resolvedPromise.inspect();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to return the result of calling `inspect` on the `resolvedPromise` object, rather than returning the `resolvedPromise` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect = function () {
    if (!resolvedPromise) {
        return { state: "pending" };
    }
    return resolvedPromise.valueOf();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to return the result of calling `valueOf` on the `resolvedPromise` object, rather than returning the `resolvedPromise` object itself.
