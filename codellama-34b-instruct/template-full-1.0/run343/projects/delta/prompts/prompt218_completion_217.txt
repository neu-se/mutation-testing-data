  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to concatenate the entire `other` object, rather than just its `ops` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to return an empty `Delta` object, rather than a new `Delta` object that combines the `this` object and the `other` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length + other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to concatenate the `this` object and the `other` object, but only up to the length of the `this` object, rather than the full length of both objects.

DONE.
