  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice` would return a substring of `w` starting from the first character, whereas `w.substr` returns a substring of `w` starting from the specified position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring` would return a substring of `w` starting from the specified position, whereas `w.substr` returns a substring of `w` starting from the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w[w.length - 2] + 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last character of `w` instead of the second-to-last character, which is what `w.substr(0, w.length - 2)` would return.

DONE.
