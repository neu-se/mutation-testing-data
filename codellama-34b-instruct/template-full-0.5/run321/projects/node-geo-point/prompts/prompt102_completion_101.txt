  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 540
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `λ2 + 360` would wrap the angle around the globe, resulting in a value between 0 and 360 degrees, while the new code fragment `λ2 + 540` would wrap the angle around the globe twice, resulting in a value between 0 and 720 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `λ2 + 360` would wrap the angle around the globe, resulting in a value between 0 and 360 degrees, while the new code fragment `λ2 + 180` would wrap the angle around the globe halfway, resulting in a value between -180 and 180 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 * 2
