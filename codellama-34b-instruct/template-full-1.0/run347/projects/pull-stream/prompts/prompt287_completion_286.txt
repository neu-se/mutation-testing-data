  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the supplied `data`, while `null` would always return a null value, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the supplied `data`, while `0` would always return a number, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the supplied `data`, while `{}` would always return an empty object, regardless of the input.

DONE.
