  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in the `if` condition being false, causing the next `else` block to be executed. The `else` block has a `return` statement, which would return the function without executing the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in the `if` condition being false, causing the next `else` block to be executed. The `else` block has a `return` statement, which would return the function without executing the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in the `if` condition being true, causing the code inside the `if` block to be executed. The `if` block contains a `return` statement, which would return the function without executing the rest of the code.

DONE.
