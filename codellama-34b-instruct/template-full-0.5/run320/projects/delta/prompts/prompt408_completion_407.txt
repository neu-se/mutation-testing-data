  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the next character instead of chopping the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the next two characters instead of chopping the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the next three characters instead of chopping the delta.

DONE.
