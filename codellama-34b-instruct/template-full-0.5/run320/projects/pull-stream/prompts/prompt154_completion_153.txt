  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `onAbort` function with no arguments, while this new code fragment calls it with no arguments. This could potentially change the behavior of the program, depending on what the `onAbort` function does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `onAbort` function with a single argument, while this new code fragment calls it with two arguments. This could potentially change the behavior of the program, depending on what the `onAbort` function does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `onAbort` function with a single argument, while this new code fragment calls it with a different argument. This could potentially change the behavior of the program, depending on what
