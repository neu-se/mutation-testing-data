  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns an object representing the parsed URL, whereas `URL.format` returns a string representing the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a resolved URL based on the input URL and the base URL, whereas `URL.format` simply returns the URL string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.split` returns an array of strings split by the input separator, whereas `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

DONE.
