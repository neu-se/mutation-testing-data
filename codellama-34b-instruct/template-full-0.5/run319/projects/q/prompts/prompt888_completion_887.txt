  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method would be called with an empty array, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method would be called with a negative number, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method would be called with a non-numeric value, which would result in an error.

DONE.
