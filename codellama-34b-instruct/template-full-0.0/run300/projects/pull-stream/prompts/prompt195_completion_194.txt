  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `null` is a null value. This change would cause the `if(aborted)` condition to always evaluate to false, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `undefined` is a special value that represents the absence of any value. This change would cause the `if(aborted)` condition to always evaluate to false, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `false` is a boolean value that represents the opposite of `true`. This change would cause the `if(aborted)` condition to always evaluate to false, potentially causing the code to behave differently.
