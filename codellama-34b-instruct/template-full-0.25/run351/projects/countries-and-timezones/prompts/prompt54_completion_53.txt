  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an object, while this new code fragment returns a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an object, while this new code fragment returns a specific element of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.map(tz => tz.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an object, while this new code fragment returns an array of strings.

DONE.
