Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words ending in 'o' that are preceded by any consonant, excluding 'y', which would incorrectly pluralize words like "bamboo" or "piano" that should not be pluralized in this way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words ending in 'o' that are preceded by a vowel, which would incorrectly pluralize words like "audio" or "video" that should not follow the same pluralization rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]o$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the flag from 'i' (case-insensitive) to 'g' (global) would cause the regex to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results when checking for matches in a string, as it would not stop after the first match.

DONE.
