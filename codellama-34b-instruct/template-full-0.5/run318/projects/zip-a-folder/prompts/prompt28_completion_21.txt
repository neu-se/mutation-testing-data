  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the archive stream has been finalized and there are no more data to be written, while the `close` event is emitted when the underlying file descriptor has been closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` event is emitted when all the data has been flushed to the underlying system, while the `close` event is emitted when the underlying file descriptor has been closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when there is an error in the archive stream, while the `close` event is emitted when the underlying file descriptor has been closed.

DONE.
