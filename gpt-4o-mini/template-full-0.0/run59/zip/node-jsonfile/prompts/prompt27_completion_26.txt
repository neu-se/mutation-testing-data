Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the `reviver` function, which can alter the parsing of the JSON data, potentially leading to different object structures or values than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `encoding` option instead of the `reviver`, which is not a valid second argument for `JSON.parse`, leading to a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly passes `undefined` as the second argument, which is equivalent to omitting the `reviver`, but could lead to confusion in the context of the function's intent, potentially affecting how the data is processed.

DONE.
