  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "memo" is not "memo" but "memos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "memo" is not "memos" but "memo".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "memo" is not "memoes" but "memos".

DONE.
