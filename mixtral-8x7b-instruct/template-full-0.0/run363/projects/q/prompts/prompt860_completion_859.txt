 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error("An error occurred")
```
This would result in different behavior because a new Error object is always created, even if an error was already provided. This could mask the original error and make debugging more difficult.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is being returned instead of passing the exception along. This could cause the promise to never be rejected, leading to unexpected behavior downstream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
