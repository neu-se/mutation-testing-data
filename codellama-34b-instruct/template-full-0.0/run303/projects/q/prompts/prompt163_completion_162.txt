  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the delimiter used to split the stack trace into lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the delimiter used to split the stack trace into lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the newline character, causing the stack trace to be treated as a single line.

DONE.
