  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `op` function to be called with the `end` argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(end && !op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `op` function if the `end` argument is truthy and the `op` function is not null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(end === false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `op` function to be called only if the `end` argument is falsey.

DONE.
