 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function is not called, and the rejection will not be removed from the unhandled rejections list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
untrackRejection.bind(null, rejection)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function will be called without the `reason` argument, and the rejection will not be removed from the unhandled rejections list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => untrackRejection(rejection, 'fakeReason')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function is called with a fake reason, and the actual reason for the rejection will be lost.

DONE.
