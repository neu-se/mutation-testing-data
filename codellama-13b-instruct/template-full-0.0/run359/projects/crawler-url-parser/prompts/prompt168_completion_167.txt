  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method returns `true` if the string starts with the specified substring, while the `includes` method returns `true` if the string contains the specified substring. In this case, the `startsWith` method would cause the `gettype` function to return `"uplevel"` for some inputs, while the `includes` method would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.endsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because the `endsWith` method returns `true` if the string ends with the specified substring, while the `includes` method returns `true` if the string contains the specified substring. In this case, the `endsWith` method would cause the `gettype` function to return `"sublevel"` for some inputs, while the `includes` method would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.indexOf
```
