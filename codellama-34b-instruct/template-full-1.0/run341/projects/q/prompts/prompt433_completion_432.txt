  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections || Date.now() >= 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to be invoked only if the `trackUnhandledRejections` flag is set to `true` or if the current timestamp is greater than or equal to 1000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections && Date.now() >= 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to be invoked only if both the `trackUnhandledRejections` flag is set to `true` and the current timestamp is greater than or equal to 1000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections || Date.now() >= 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to be invoked
