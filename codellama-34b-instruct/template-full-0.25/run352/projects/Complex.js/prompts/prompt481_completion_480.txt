  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']()) {
  return 'Infinity';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is infinite, while this code checks if the real part is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (Math.abs(b) < Complex['EPSILON']) {
  b = 0;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the absolute value of the imaginary part is less than the epsilon value, while this code checks if the absolute value of the real part is less than the epsilon value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (1 !== b) { // b is the absolute imaginary part
  ret += b;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the absolute imaginary part is not equal to 1, while this code checks if the absolute
