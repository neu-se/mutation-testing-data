  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain
```
This change will cause the `retain` method to be called on the `otherOp` object, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).insert
```
This change will cause the `insert` method to be called on the `otherOp` object, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).delete
```
This change will cause the `delete` method to be called on the `otherOp` object, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
