  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER code fragment is used to generate a regular expression that matches words ending in 's', but by replacing it with the given code fragment, we would be adding the word 'new illness' to the array of words, which would cause the regular expression to match an additional word that it didn't match before.
