  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of the `ended` variable, potentially causing the `else if` block to be skipped when it should be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended == true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `ended` variable to the boolean value `true`, potentially causing the `else if` block to be skipped when it should be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would logically AND the `ended` variable with the boolean value `false`, potentially causing the `else if` block to be skipped when it should be executed.

DONE.
