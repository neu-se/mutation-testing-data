  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, { foo: ctx }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx` variable is now an object with the property `foo` instead of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb, path, { bar: ctx }
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is different, and the `ctx` variable is now an object with the property `bar` instead of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb, path, { baz: ctx }
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is different, and the `ctx` variable is now an object with the property `baz` instead of a string.

DONE.
