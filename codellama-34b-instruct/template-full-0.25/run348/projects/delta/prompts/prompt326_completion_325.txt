  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a different operation than `op.delete`, and would retain the text instead of deleting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a different operation than `op.delete`, and would insert text instead of deleting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `!op.delete` is a different condition than `op.delete`, and would negate the condition, resulting in the opposite behavior.

DONE.
