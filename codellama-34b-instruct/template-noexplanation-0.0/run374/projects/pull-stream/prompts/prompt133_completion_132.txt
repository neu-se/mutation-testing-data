  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, true)
```
This change will cause the callback function to be called with a non-error value, which may cause the test to pass even if the code is not functioning correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('error'))
```
This change will cause the callback function to be called with an error value, which may cause the test to fail even if the code is functioning correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, false)
```
This change will cause the callback function to be called with a non-error value, but with a different value than the original code fragment. This may cause the test to fail even if the code is functioning correctly.

DONE.
