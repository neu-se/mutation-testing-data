  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause the program to throw an error, while `reject` would reject a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` would resolve a promise, while `reject` would reject a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.end()` would end the output stream, while `reject` would reject a promise.

DONE.
