  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not equal to `null`, which means that the callback function would be called with different arguments, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not equal to `data`, which means that the callback function would be called with different arguments, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is not equal to `null`, which means that the callback function would be called with different arguments, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

DONE.
