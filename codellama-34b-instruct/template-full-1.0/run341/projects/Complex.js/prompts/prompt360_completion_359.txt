  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was referring to the imaginary part of the complex number, but the replacement code fragment is referring to the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was referring to the real part of the complex number, but the replacement code fragment is referring to the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was only using the real part of the complex number, but the replacement code fragment is using both the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

DONE.
