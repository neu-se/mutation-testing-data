  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `1` as the second argument to `array_slice()`, which extracts the first element of the array. Using `2` as the second argument would extract the second element of the array, which could lead to a different behavior if the array has only one element.

DONE.
