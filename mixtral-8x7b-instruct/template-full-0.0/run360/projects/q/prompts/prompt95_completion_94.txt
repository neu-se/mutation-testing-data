 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not check the current index against the length before accessing the array element, potentially causing an "index out of bounds" error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index + 1 > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would check the next index instead of the current index against the length, potentially skipping the last element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index * 2 > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would check if the current index multiplied by 2 is greater than the length, which would cause the loop to terminate prematurely in most cases.

DONE.
