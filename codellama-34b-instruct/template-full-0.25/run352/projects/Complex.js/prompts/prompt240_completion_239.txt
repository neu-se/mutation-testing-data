  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations in subsequent operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations in subsequent operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations in subsequent operations.

DONE.
