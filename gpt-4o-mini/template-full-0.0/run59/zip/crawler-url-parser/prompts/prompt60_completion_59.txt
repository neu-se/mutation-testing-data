Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the parsing options to not use the `slashesDenoteHost` and `parseQueryString` options, which could lead to incorrect parsing of URLs that contain query strings or slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `baseUrlStr` instead of `currentUrlStr`, which would lead to parsing the base URL instead of the current URL, potentially resulting in incorrect URL resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr + 'invalid', true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because appending 'invalid' to `currentUrlStr` would create an invalid URL, which could cause the parsing to fail or produce unexpected results, leading to a null or malformed output.

DONE.
