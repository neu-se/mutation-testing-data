  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which would change the outcome of the `all` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved, which would change the outcome of the `all` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.cancel
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be cancelled instead of resolved, which would change the outcome of the `all` function.

DONE.
