Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cellos'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly returns the same string as the input, rather than the expected plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celloes'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an incorrect pluralization rule that is not standard in English, as the correct plural form is 'cellos'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celli'
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies an incorrect Latin pluralization rule, which is not applicable to the word 'cello'.

DONE.
