  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.resolve` method returns a resolved URL, while the `URL.format` method returns a formatted URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method returns a parsed URL, while the `URL.format` method returns a formatted URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.format` method returns a formatted URL, while the `URL.resolve` method returns a resolved URL.

DONE.
