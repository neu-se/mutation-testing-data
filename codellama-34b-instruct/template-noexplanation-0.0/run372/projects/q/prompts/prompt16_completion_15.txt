  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block if both `window` and `self` are defined, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" || typeof self !== "undefined" || typeof global !== "undefined"
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block if any of `window`, `self`, or `global` are defined, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined" && typeof global !== "undefined"
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block if all of `window`, `self`, and `global` are defined, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
