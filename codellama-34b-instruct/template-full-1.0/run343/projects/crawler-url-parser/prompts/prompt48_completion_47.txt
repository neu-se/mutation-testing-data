  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(baseUrl, URL.parse(currentUrlStr))
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` resolves a relative URL to a base URL, while `URL.parse` only parses a URL string into an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new URL(currentUrlStr, baseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `new URL` creates a new URL object using a base URL and a relative URL, while `URL.parse` only parses a URL string into an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, baseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` can take in an additional parameter `baseUrl` to parse a relative URL with a base URL, while `URL.resolve` only takes in one URL object as a parameter.

DONE.
