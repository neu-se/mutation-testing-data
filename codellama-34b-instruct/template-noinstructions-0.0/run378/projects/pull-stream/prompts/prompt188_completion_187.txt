  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable would be decremented instead of incremented, causing the function to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable would be incremented by 2 instead of 1, causing the function to skip over some elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i*2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable would be multiplied by 2 instead of being incremented, causing the function to return the wrong value.

DONE.
