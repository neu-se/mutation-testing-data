Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the property of `b` using the `embedType` variable, which may not match the expected property name, leading to potential undefined behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly access the second key of object `b`, which may not exist, causing the error message to be misleading or incorrect when comparing embed types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)[0] + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append '1' to the first key of object `b`, causing the embed type comparison to always fail, leading to an error even when the types might match.

DONE.
