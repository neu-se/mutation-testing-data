  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` removes characters from the right side of the string, while `trimLeft()` removes characters from the left side. This could cause the code to behave differently for URLs that have whitespace on the left or right sides.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.endsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `endsWith()` checks if the string ends with the given substring, while `startsWith()` checks if the string starts with the given substring. This could cause the code to behave differently for URLs that have different suffixes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes()` checks if the string contains the given substring, while `startsWith()` checks if the string starts with the given substring. This could cause the code to behave differently for URLs that have different substrings.

DONE.
