  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/append|ix/i
```
This change would result in different behavior because the literal string "append" would be matched anywhere in the input, not just at the end of a word as in the original fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/append|ix/gi
```
This change would result in different behavior because the "g" flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regex to be tested against all possible matches in the input, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/append/gi
```
This change would result in different behavior because the "g" flag would cause the regex to be tested against all possible matches in the input, not just the first one, and the "ix" alternation would be removed, so the regex would not match any words that end in "ix".

DONE.
