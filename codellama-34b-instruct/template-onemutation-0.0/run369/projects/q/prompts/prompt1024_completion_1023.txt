  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` is a function that takes two arguments, but `nodeback()` is a function call that returns the result of calling `nodeback` with no arguments. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nodeback` has side effects or if it returns a value that is used in the rest of the code.

DONE.
