  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `args || []` is a default value, and in this case, `undefined` will be returned instead of an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `args || []` is a default value, and in this case, `null` will be returned instead of an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args || []` is a default value, and in this case, an empty array will be returned instead of `undefined` or `null`.

DONE.
