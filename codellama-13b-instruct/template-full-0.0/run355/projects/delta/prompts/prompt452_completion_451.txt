  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause the method to be called immediately and return a boolean value, rather than returning the method itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, which is not necessary in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not use the `bind` method to bind the `this` keyword to the current object, which would cause the method to be called with a different context.

DONE.
