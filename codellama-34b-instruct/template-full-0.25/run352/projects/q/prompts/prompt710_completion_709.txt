  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that is already resolved with an empty array, instead of a promise that is resolved with the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", ["foo"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that is already resolved with an array containing the string "foo", instead of a promise that is resolved with the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [object])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that is already resolved with an array containing the object itself, instead of a promise that is resolved with the keys of the eventually settled object.

DONE.
