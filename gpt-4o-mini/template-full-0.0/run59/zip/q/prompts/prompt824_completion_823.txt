Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of throwing the error, it logs the error to the console, which means the error will not propagate as an unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Custom error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a new error with a custom message instead of the original error, which may lead to loss of the original error context and stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it disables the global error handler, meaning that unhandled errors will not be caught and handled by the `Q.onerror` function, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

DONE.
