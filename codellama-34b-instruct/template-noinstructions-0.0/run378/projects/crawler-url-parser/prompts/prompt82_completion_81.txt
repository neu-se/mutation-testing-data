  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method is not defined on the `this` object, and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` method is not defined on the `this` object, and would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method is not defined on the `this` object, and would throw an error.

DONE.
