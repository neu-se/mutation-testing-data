  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the policy name to lowercase, which could cause the `get()` method to return a different policy than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the policy name starting from the second character, which could cause the `get()` method to return a different policy than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the policy name, which could cause the `get()` method to return a different policy than the one intended.

DONE.
