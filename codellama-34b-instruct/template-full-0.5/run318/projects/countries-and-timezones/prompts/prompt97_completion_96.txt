  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName).name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the timezone object, instead of the timezone object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName).deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the deprecated status of the timezone object, instead of the timezone object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName).timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezone objects, instead of a single timezone object.

DONE.
