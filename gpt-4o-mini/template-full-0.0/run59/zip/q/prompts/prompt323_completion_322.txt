Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` directly instead of the `promise`, potentially leading to incorrect context and unexpected results when the method is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `promise` would cause the method to lose its context, which may lead to runtime errors or incorrect behavior when trying to access properties or methods on `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `promise` would mean that the method is called without a valid context, which could lead to errors when trying to access properties or methods that expect a valid object.

DONE.
