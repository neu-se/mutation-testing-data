  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ")[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `trim()` to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the text, while the new code fragment uses `split(" ")[0]` to get the first word of the text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().slice(0, 3);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `trim()` to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the text, while the new code fragment uses `slice(0, 3)` to get the first three characters of the text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `trim()` to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the text, while the new code fragment uses a regular
