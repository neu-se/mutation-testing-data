  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot
```
This would result in different behavior because `filterNot` is a different function altogether, and it will not filter any data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filterNot` expects a function as its argument, but `data` is a variable containing an array of objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot(function(d) { return !d.age })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function passed to `filterNot` has a different implementation than the original code fragment. It uses the `!d.age` expression, which will return `true` for any data where `d.age` is falsy (e.g., `0`, `null`, `undefined`, etc.).

DONE.
