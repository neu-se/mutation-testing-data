  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
formatter: false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the usage of the `formatter` option, which could cause issues with the configuration of the `zip` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: ' compress'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the compression method used by the `zip` function, which could affect the resulting archive contents and properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'ZIP'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the file format used by the `zip` function, which could affect the resulting archive contents and properties.

DONE.
