Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly indicate that the `MessageChannel` API is not available, leading to the fallback to the old browsers' requestTick implementation, which uses `setTimeout` instead of the more efficient `MessageChannel`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly evaluate to true in environments where `MessageChannel` is not a function but an object, potentially causing the code to execute the block intended for modern browsers even when the `MessageChannel` functionality is not available.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel === "function" && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false, causing the code to skip the `MessageChannel` implementation entirely and fall back to the old browsers' requestTick implementation, which is less efficient.

DONE.
