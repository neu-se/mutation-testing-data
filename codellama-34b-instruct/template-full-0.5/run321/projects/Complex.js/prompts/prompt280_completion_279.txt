  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `a`, potentially leading to a different calculation of the complex sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would change the value of `a`, potentially leading to a different calculation of the complex sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not used in the original code fragment, and using it would change the calculation of the complex sine.

DONE.
