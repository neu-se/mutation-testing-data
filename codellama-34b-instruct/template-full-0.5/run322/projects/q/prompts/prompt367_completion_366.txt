  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error("Buggy code"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error message, rather than the original exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(exception.message)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the message of the original exception, rather than the exception itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a null value, rather than the original exception.

DONE.
