  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a hash character in the URL, while this new code fragment would remove any hash character and everything after it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a protocol in the URL, while this new code fragment would add the "http://" protocol if it was not present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!localhost)\w+:/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a protocol in the URL, while this new code fragment would remove the protocol if it was not "localhost".

DONE.
