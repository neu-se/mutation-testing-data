  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```hex code```
This would result in different behavior because the hex code would be interpreted as a different number than the decimal code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the hyperbolic sine of the argument instead of the natural logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.coth
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the hyperbolic cotangent of the argument instead of the natural logarithm.

DONE.
