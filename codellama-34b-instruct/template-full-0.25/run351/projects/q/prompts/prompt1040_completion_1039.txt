  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a deferred object, while `Q.defer().promise` returns a promise object. The `put` method in the original code expects a deferred object, so replacing it with a promise object would cause the method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().resolve` is a function that resolves the deferred object, while `Q.defer()` returns a deferred object. The `put` method in the original code expects a deferred object, so replacing it with a function that resolves the deferred object would cause the method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().reject` is a function that rejects the deferred
