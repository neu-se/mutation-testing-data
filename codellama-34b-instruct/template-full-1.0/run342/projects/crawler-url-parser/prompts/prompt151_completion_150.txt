  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host == pageurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `hostname` is a different property than `host` and may not be equivalent in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host !== pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is a different operator than `==` and may produce a different result in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host.includes(pageurl.host)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` can produce different results than `==` or `!=` in some cases where the `host` string contains multiple values.

DONE.
