  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` are different variables, and using `point2Rad` instead of `point1Rad` would cause the `calculateDistance` method to use the wrong value for the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `point2.latitude` is a different value than `point1Rad`, and using it instead of `point1Rad` would cause the `calculateDistance` method to use the wrong value for the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `point2.longitude` is a different value than `point1Rad`, and using it instead of `point1Rad` would cause the `calculateDistance` method to use the wrong value for the calculation.

DONE.
