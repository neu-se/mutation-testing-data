  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the arguments to be passed to the function in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` removes the first element of the array, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(["dummy arg"])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat(["dummy arg"])` adds an extra argument to the end of the array, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong number of arguments.

DONE.
