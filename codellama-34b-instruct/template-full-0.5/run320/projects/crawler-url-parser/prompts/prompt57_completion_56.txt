  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^http:\/\//, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the "http" protocol with "https", which could potentially cause the URL to be parsed differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https:\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the "https" protocol with "http", which could potentially cause the URL to be parsed differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "http" or "https" protocol from the URL, which could potentially cause the URL to be parsed differently.

DONE.
