  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a vertical stretching effect, causing the calculated distance to be significantly different from the actual distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const π = Math.PI;

cos(π / 2 - φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a horizontal stretching effect, causing the calculated distance to be significantly different from the actual distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ2) - cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a dimensional error, causing the calculated distance to be significantly different from the actual distance.

DONE.
