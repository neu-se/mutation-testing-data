  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of just the real part, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of just the real part, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
