 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `indexOf` method instead of the `array_indexOf` utility function, which could lead to incorrect index being returned if the array contains multiple identical objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.includes
