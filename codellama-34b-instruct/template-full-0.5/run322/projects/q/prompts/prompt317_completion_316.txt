  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create` is a function that creates a new object, while `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create` is a function that creates a new object, while `undefined` is a primitive value that represents an uninitialized or non-existent variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create` is a function that creates a new object, while `{}` is an empty object literal that creates a new object with no properties.

DONE.
