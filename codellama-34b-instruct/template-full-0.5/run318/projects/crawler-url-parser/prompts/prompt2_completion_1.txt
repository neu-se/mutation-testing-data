  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `test()` method of the regular expression, which checks if the string matches the pattern. However, the `toLowerCase()` method returns a new string with all characters in lowercase, which may not match the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match any character that is not a letter, digit, or one of the special characters in the pattern. However, the `replace()` method with an empty string as the second argument would remove all occurrences of these characters, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.split('').reverse().join('')
