  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used to determine the operation to be performed on the `object` and `args` arguments, and adding 1 to `op` would change the operation to be performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used to determine the operation to be performed on the `object` and `args` arguments, and subtracting 1 from `op` would change the operation to be performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used to determine the operation to be performed on the `object` and `args` arguments, and multiplying `op` by 2 would change the operation to be performed.

DONE.
