  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called immediately, instead of being called after the timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called immediately, instead of being called after the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would be called immediately, instead of being called after the timeout.

DONE.
