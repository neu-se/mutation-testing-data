  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `arguments` object, while the mutated code would pass `null` as the argument to `post` instead of the expected `Array`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `arguments` object, while the mutated code would pass an empty array as the argument to `post` instead of the expected `Array`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `arguments` object, while the mutated code would pass a function as the argument to `post` instead of the expected `Array`.

DONE.
