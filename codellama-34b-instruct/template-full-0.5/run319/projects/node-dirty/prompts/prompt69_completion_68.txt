  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(null, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the emit function would be called with a null event name, which is not a valid event name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the emit function would be called with an invalid event name ('error' is not a valid event name for this object), which would cause an error to be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the emit function would be called with a different number of arguments (1 instead of 0), which would cause an error to be emitted.

DONE.
