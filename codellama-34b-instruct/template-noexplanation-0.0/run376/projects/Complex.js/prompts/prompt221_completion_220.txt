  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This change will cause the `sin` function to be applied to the wrong value, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This change will cause the `sin` function to be applied to the sum of `a` and `b`, which may produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This change will cause the `sin` function to be applied to the product of `a` and `b`, which may produce a different output.

DONE.
