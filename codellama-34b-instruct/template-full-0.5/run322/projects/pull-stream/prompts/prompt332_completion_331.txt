  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `true`, causing the `onEnd` function to be called with `null` instead of the actual `end` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `false`, causing the `onEnd` function to never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ^ true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator would always return `true`, causing the `onEnd` function to be called with `null` instead of the actual `end` value.

DONE.
