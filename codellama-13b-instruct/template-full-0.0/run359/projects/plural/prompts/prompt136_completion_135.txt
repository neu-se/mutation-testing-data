  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function is now being called with the `toString()` method, which would return the string representation of the function, rather than the string representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function is now being called with the `call()` method, which would set the `this` context of the function to the current object, rather than the global object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function is now being bound to the current object using the `bind()` method, which would create a new function with the `this` context set to the current object, rather than the global object.

DONE.
