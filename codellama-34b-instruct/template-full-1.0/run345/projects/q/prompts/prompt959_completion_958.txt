  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function(){}` is a different function from `array_slice` and would return a new function instead of a slice of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"array_slice"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"array_slice"` is a string and would not result in the same behavior as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("Test error")` would throw an error and stop the execution of the code, which is different from the original behavior of the code fragment.

DONE.
