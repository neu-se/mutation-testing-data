  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-adjust
```
This would result in different behavior because `adjust` is a unary operator that negates the number, while `-adjust` is a binary operator that subtracts the number from 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the result of `adjust`, while the original code does not modify the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the result of `adjust` by 2, while the original code does not modify the result.

DONE.
