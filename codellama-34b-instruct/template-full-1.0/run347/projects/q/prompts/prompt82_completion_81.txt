  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, and `laterQueue.push(0)` will not have the same effect as `laterQueue.push(task)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a truthy value, and `laterQueue.push(true)` will not have the same effect as `laterQueue.push(task)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"task"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"task"` is a string, and `laterQueue.push("task")` will not have the same effect as `laterQueue.push(task)`.

DONE.
