 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the attributes object with null, causing an error when trying to access properties of a null value in the following lines of code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the attributes object with an empty object, causing any existing attributes to be lost.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the attributes of the lastOp instead of the newOp, potentially causing the newOp to lose any specified attributes.

DONE.
