  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the divisor being non-zero, and the replaced code fragment would always evaluate to true, causing the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the divisor being a number, and the replaced code fragment would always evaluate to false, causing the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the divisor being a number, and the replaced code fragment would always evaluate to false, causing the function to return a different result.

DONE.
