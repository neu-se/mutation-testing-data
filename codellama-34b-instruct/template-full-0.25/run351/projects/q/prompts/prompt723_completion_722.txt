  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the state of the promise to be "fulfilled", while this replacement checks for the state to be "rejected".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the value of the promise to be non-null, while this replacement checks for the value to be null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the state of the promise to be "fulfilled", while this replacement checks for the state to be "pending".

DONE.
