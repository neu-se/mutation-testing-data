  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + this[index] * index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is adding `basis` and `this[index]`, while the new code is multiplying them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] / basis
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is adding `basis` and `this[index]`, while the new code is dividing them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis - this[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is adding `basis` and `this[index]`, while the new code is subtracting them.

DONE.
