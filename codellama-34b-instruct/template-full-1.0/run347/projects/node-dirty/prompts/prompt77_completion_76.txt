  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `load` event's second argument from 0 to 1, which could break code that relies on the specific value of this argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `load` event's second argument to the current size of the database, which could break code that relies on the specific value of this argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `load` event's second argument to a negative value, which could break code that doesn't expect a negative value for this argument.

DONE.
