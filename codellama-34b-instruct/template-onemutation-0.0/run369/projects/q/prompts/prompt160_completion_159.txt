  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: stack + "foo", configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the stack trace, which would change the value of the "stack" property and potentially cause the `filterStackString` function to behave differently.
