  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square root of a number, while the buggy code fragment calculates the square root of a number plus one. This could cause the test to fail if the input value is negative, as the square root of a negative number is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square root of a number, while the buggy code fragment calculates the square root of a number minus one. This could cause the test to fail if the input value is negative, as the square root of a negative number is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square root of
