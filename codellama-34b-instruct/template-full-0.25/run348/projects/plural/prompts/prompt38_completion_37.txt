  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regular expression match all occurrences in the input string, instead of just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive, so it would match "Appendix" and "INDEX" as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-sensitive, so it would only match "Appendix" and "index", but not "INDEX".

DONE.
