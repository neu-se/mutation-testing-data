  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This change will cause the `csch` function to return the wrong value, as it will use the sine function instead of the cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This change will cause the `sech` function to return the wrong value, as it will use the tangent function instead of the cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This change will cause the `asinh` function to return the wrong value, as it will use the inverse cosine function instead of the cosine function.

DONE.
