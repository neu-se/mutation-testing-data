  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to use the latitude of the second point instead of the first point, which will result in a different distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to use the longitude of the first point instead of the latitude, which will result in a different distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateDistance` method to use the longitude of the second point instead of the latitude, which will result in a different distance calculation.

DONE.
