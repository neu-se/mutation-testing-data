 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / x['re'], x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the result would be inverted, and the imaginary part would remain unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x['re'] * 0, x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the result would always be zero, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x['re'], x['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the result would be twice the original value, while the real part would remain unchanged.

These changes would introduce mutations in the code, potentially exposing weaknesses in the test suite. DONE.
