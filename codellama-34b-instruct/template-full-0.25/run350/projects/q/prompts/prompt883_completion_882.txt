  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error, rather than rejecting it, which could cause the program to continue executing with an error that should have been handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise with the error, rather than rejecting it, which could cause the program to continue executing with an error that should have been handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Different error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with a different error message, which could cause the program to handle the error differently than it was intended.

DONE.
