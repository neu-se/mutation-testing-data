  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x != y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x === y` uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality and would only return `true` if `x` and `y` are the same Object or have the same value. By replacing it with `x != y`, which uses the `!=` operator, the test would pass if `x` and `y` have different values or are different Objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x === y` uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality and would only return `true` if `x` and `y` are the same Object or have the same value. By replacing it with `x > y`, which uses the `>` operator, the test would pass if `x` is greater than `y`, even if they are not the same value or Object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
