  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
