  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is `true`, but this replacement checks if `err` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is `true`, but this replacement checks if `err` is equal to `err`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is `true`, but this replacement checks if `err` is `undefined`.

DONE.
