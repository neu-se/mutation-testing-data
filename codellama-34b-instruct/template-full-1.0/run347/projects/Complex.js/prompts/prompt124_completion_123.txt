  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']();
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNan()` is a function that checks whether a value is NaN or not, while `isInfinite()` is a function that checks whether a value is infinite or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNan']();
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNan()` is a function that checks whether a value is NaN or not, while `isInfinite()` is a function that checks whether a value is infinite or not. Additionally, `this` is not a valid keyword in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['NAN'].toString();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex['NAN']` is a constant representing the string "NaN", while `isInfinite()` is a function that checks whether a value is infinite or not.

DONE.
