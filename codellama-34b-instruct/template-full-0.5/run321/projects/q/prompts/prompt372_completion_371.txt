  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, and by calling it, the code would be executing a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be redefining the `Q.onerror` function to do nothing, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be redefining the `Q.onerror` function to throw an error, which would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
