  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to delete a key that is not present in the map, which would not have any effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to set a key to `undefined`, which would not be stored in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to set a key to an empty string, which would be stored in the map as a valid key.

DONE.
