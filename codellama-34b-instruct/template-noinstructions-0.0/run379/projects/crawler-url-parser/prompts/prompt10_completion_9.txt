  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, which could cause the code to fail if the input string contains certain characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol is changed from HTTP to HTTPS, which could cause the code to fail if the input string is not compatible with HTTPS.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol is removed from the input string, which could cause the code to fail if the input string is not a valid URL.

DONE.
