  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the line number by 1, potentially causing the stack trace to point to the wrong line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the line number by 1, potentially causing the stack trace to point to the wrong line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the line number, potentially causing the stack trace to point to a different line.

DONE.
