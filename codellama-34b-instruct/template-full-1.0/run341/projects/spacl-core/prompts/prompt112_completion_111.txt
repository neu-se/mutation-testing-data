  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb in verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator checks for the presence of a property in an object, whereas the `of` operator iterates over the values of an object. In this case, the `for...of` loop would iterate over the values of the `verbs` object, whereas the `for...in` loop would iterate over the properties of the `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.keys(verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of the keys of the `verbs` object, whereas the `for...of` loop would iterate over the values of the `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.values(verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the
