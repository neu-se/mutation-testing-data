  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a built-in Python function that returns a list with all the elements of an iterable, while `none` is a Python keyword that represents the absence of a value. Using `none` instead of `all` would cause the code to fail with a `TypeError` because it would be trying to call a function on a non-callable object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
len
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a built-in Python function that returns a list with all the elements of an iterable, while `len` is a built-in Python function that returns the length of an object. Using `len` instead of `all` would cause the code to fail with a `TypeError` because it would be trying to call a function on a non-callable object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sum
```
This would result in different behavior because `
