  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, as the condition would be true for one additional iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate forever, as the condition would always be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over even-indexed elements, as the condition would only be true for even-indexed elements.

DONE.
