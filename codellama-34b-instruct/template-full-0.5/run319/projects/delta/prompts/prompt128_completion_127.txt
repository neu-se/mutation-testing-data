  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the iterator to start one position later than it should, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the iterator to start one position earlier than it should, potentially causing it to miss important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the iterator to start two positions earlier than it should, potentially causing it to miss important operations.

DONE.
