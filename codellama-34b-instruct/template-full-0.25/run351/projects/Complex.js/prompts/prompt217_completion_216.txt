  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * loh + z['re'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations is different, which could lead to a different result in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra 1 is added to the result, which could affect the final output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part is multiplied by 2 instead of 1, which could lead to a different result in some cases.

DONE.
