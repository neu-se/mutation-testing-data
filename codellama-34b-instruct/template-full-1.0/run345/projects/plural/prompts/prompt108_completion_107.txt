  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(word) {return word + 'es'}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function would not modify the word if it ends in "s", while the new function would add "es" regardless of the word's ending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(word) {return word + 'is'}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function would not modify the word if it ends in "is", while the new function would add "is" regardless of the word's ending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(word) {return word + 'os'}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function would not modify the word if it ends in "os", while the new function would add "os" regardless of the word's ending.

DONE.
