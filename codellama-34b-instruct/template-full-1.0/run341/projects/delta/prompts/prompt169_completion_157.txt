  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called on the Iterator object, which could result in an infinite loop if the iterator is not properly incremented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called on a different Iterator object, which could result in the code skipping over certain operations in the sequence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method is called on the `ops` property of the `delta` object, which could result in the code skipping over certain operations in the sequence or causing a runtime error if the `ops` property is empty.

DONE.
