  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `error` object is being thrown, while in this variant, a `promise` is being returned. The `error.message` property is a string that describes the error, so it is not the same as the `error` object that is being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve(error), promise
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(error), promise
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the promise is rejected with the `error` object as the reason, while in this variant, the promise is rejected with the `error.message` string as the
