  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is always non-negative, while `0` is always negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is always non-negative, while `-length` is always negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is always non-negative, while `length + 1` is always positive.

DONE.
