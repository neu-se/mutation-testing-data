  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invoke` method to behave the same as the `mcall` method, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invoke` method to behave the same as the `fapply` method, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invoke` method to behave the same as the `fcall` method, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
