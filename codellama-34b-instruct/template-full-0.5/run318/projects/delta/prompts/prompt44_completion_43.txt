  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `a` not being an object and `a` being null, while this replacement only checks for `a` not being an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `a` not being an object and `a` being null, while this replacement only checks for `a` being null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `a` not being an object and `a` being null, while this replacement only checks for `a` being an object.

DONE.
