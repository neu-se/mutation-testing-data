  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d * d
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function would return a different value.

DONE.
