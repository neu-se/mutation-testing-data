  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would return a different value, which could cause the `tan` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would return a different value, which could cause the `cot` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sec` function would return a different value, which could cause the `csc` function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
