  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of the promise's state, which would cause the `isPending` function to always return `true` and the `isFulfilled` function to always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of the promise's state, which would cause the `isPending` function to always return `false` and the `isFulfilled` function to always return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "rejected";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of the promise's state, which would cause the `isPending` function to always return `false` and
