  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s` is an object, but not if it's a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s` is a function, but not if it's an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && (typeof s === 'object' || typeof s === 'function')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s` is either an object or a function, but not if it's a different type of value.

DONE.
