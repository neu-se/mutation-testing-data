  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to return `null` instead of the original `end` value, which could cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to return `null` instead of the original `end` value, which could cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

DONE.
