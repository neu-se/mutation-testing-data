  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip every other key in the object, potentially causing the `object_keys` function to return an incomplete list of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the previous key in the object, potentially causing the `object_keys` function to return a key that is not actually present in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include every key twice in the object, potentially causing the `object_keys` function to return a list of keys that is twice as long as it should be.

DONE.
