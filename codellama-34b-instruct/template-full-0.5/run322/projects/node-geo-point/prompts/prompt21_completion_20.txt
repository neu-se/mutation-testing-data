  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === undefined || object.longitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has the specified property as a direct property of that object, whereas the `=== undefined` check checks if the property exists and has the value of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === null || object.longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has the specified property as a direct property of that object, whereas the `=== null` check checks if the property exists and has the value of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude !== object.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has the specified property as a direct property of that object, whereas the `!==` check checks if the property exists and has
