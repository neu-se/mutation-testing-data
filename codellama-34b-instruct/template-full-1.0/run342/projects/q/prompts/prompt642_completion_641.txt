  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```[name, args.reverse()]```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method mutates the original array, whereas the original code fragment creates a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```[name, args.shift()]```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method mutates the original array and removes the first element, whereas the original code fragment takes the first element without modifying the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```[name, args.slice(1)]```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array without modifying the original array, whereas the original code fragment takes the first element without modifying the array.

DONE.
