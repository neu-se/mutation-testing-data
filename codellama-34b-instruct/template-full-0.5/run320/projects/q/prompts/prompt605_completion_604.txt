  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `self.promiseDispatch` would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `self` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `self` object with `deferred.reject` as an argument, whereas the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to `self.promiseDispatch`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code fragment did not have any code to reject the promise.

DONE.
