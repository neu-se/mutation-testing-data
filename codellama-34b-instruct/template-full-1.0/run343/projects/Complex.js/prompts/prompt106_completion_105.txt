  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `z` object is not defined, so accessing its properties would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` class does not have an `INFINITY` static property, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new instance of the `Complex` class with the same values as the original `a` and `b` parameters, which is not the behavior intended by the original code.

DONE.
