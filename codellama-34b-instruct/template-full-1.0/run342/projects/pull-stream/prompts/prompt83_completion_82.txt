  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is a boolean value indicating whether the stream should be aborted, whereas `read` is a function that reads data from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a boolean value that is always true, whereas `read` is a function that may return different values depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
! op
```
This would result in different behavior because `! op` is a negated version of the `op` variable, which is a function that returns a boolean value.

DONE.
