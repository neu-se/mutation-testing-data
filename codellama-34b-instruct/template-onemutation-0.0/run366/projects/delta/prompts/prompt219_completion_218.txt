  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while the new code fragment checks for inequality. This would cause the `diff()` method to return a different result when the `ops` properties of the two `Delta` objects are not equal.

DONE.
