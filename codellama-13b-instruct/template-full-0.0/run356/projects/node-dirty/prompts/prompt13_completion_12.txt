  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called immediately, rather than being added to the queue. This could cause issues if the callback function relies on the data being persisted to disk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called with the context of the `Dirty` class, rather than being called with the context of the caller. This could cause issues if the callback function relies on the context being correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.bind(this)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be bound to the context of the `Dirty` class, and then called immediately. This could cause issues if the callback function relies on the context being correct.

DONE.
