  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `when` is a function that returns a promise, but `noop` is a function that returns `undefined`. This would cause the promise returned by `when` to be ignored, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `when` is a function that returns a promise, but `function () {}` is a function that returns `undefined`. This would cause the promise returned by `when` to be ignored, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, function () { return promise; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `when` is a function that returns a promise, but `function () { return promise; }` is a function that returns a promise. This would
