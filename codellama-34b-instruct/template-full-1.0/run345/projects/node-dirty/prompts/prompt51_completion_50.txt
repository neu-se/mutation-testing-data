  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a property from an object, while `get` is a method that retrieves a value from an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of a value, while `this.get` would attempt to retrieve a value from an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a value that indicates the absence of an object reference, while `this.get` would attempt to retrieve a value from an object.

DONE.
