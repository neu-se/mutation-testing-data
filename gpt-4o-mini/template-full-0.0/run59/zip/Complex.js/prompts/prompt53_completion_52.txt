Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the sine of the argument instead of the cosine, leading to incorrect results when calculating the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the tangent of the argument instead of the cosine, which would significantly alter the output, especially for angles where the tangent function approaches infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the variable `a` instead of `b` as the input to the cosine function, leading to incorrect calculations of the real part of the complex number based on the wrong variable.

DONE.
