  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `done` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the promise has already been resolved. This would cause the `deferred.resolve()` method to be called multiple times, which is not allowed in the Q library.
