 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Error object, while the original code fragment uses the exception object that was caught in the try-catch block. This change would affect any error handling in the `_rejected` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `self` object (the current promise) instead of the `exception` object. This change would cause the `_rejected` function to behave differently, as it would have access to the promise object instead of the exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `exception` object with a null value. This change would cause the `_rejected` function to behave differently, as it would not have access to the exception object.

DONE.
