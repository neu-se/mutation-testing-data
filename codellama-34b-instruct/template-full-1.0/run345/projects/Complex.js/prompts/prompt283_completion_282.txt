  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator negates the operand, so the result of `cos(a) * cosh(b)` would be negated, which is different from the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
@
```
This would result in different behavior because the `@` operator is used for matrix multiplication in Python, so the result of `cos(a) * cosh(b)` would be a matrix, which is different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
&
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&` operator is used for bitwise AND in Python, so the result of `cos(a) * cosh(b)` would be a bitwise AND operation rather than a multiplication, which is different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
