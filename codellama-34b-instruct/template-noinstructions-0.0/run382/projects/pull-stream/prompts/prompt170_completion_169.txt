  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass the value `true` to the callback, while the new code fragment `cb(null, null)` would pass `null` to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass the value `true` to the callback, while the new code fragment `cb(null, array[i++])` would pass the value of `array[i++]` to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass the value `true` to the callback, while the new code fragment `cb(null, array[i++])` would pass the value of `array[i++]` to the callback.
