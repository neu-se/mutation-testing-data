  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply", and it would not pass the array of arguments as a single argument to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the array of arguments as a single element of a new array, rather than as a single argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `this` value for the function, rather than `void 0`.

DONE.
