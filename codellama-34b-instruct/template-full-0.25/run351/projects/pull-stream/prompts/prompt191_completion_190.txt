  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.map` is a function that returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, whereas `prop` is a function that returns the value of a property in an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })` is a function that returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, whereas `prop` is a function that returns the value of a property in an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })` is
