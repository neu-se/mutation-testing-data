  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback` is a function that handles errors, while `callback` is a function that handles successful results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects a promise, while `callback` is a function that resolves a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, while `callback` is a function that resolves a promise.

DONE.
