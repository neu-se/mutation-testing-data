  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` parameter is incremented by 1, which would cause the offset string to be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` parameter is used instead of `utcOffset`, which would cause the offset string to be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` and `dstOffset` parameters are added together, which would cause the offset string to be different from the original.

DONE.
