  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1, while this code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 || string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1 and ends with a slash, while this code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1 or ends with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && !string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1 and ends with a slash, while this code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1 and does not end with a slash.
