  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `end`, which could cause the `read` function to be called with the wrong argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to `false`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to `true`, regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
