  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice()` would return an empty array instead of an array containing the arguments starting from the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice()` would return an array containing `arguments.length` empty elements instead of an array containing the arguments starting from the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
n => n + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice()` would return an array containing the arguments starting from the second argument plus one instead of the actual arguments from the second argument onwards.

DONE.
