  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, instead of the object being iterated over in the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, since `key + 1` would always be an even number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `key.length` would be `undefined` for non-string keys, and would fail for string keys that have a length greater than 1.

DONE.
