  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` is a function that returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekLength` without the parentheses would return the function itself, which would likely cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the next operation in the iterator, which could cause the iterator to skip over some operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the next operation in the iterator, which could cause the iterator to skip over some operations.

DONE.
