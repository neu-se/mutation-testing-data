  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && 1 === 2
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it includes an additional condition that is always false (`1 === 2`). This will cause the `define` function to be called with a different set of arguments, which may reveal bugs in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && typeof exports === 'object'
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it includes an additional condition that checks if `exports` is an object. This may cause the `define` function to be called with a different set of arguments, which may reveal bugs in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && typeof module === 'object'
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it includes an additional condition that checks if `module` is an
