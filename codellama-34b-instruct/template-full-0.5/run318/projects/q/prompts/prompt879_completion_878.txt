  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err, value) {
    if (err) {
        deferred.reject(err);
    } else {
        deferred.resolve(value);
    }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` which creates a function that returns a promise, whereas this code fragment creates a function that takes an error and a value as arguments and resolves or rejects the promise accordingly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err, value) {
    if (err) {
        deferred.reject(err);
    } else {
        deferred.resolve(value);
    }
}
