  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splits the stack string into lines, but this replacement would split it into individual characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splits the stack string into lines, but this replacement would convert the entire string to lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(" ").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splits the stack string into lines, but this replacement would split the string into words and then join them back into a single string.

DONE.
