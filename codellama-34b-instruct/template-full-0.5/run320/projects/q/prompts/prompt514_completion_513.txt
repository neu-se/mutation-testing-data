  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the next tick of the event loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.notify(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified of the exception, rather than rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the exception, rather than rejected.

DONE.
