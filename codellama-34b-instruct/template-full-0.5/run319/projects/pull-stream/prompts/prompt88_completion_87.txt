  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.foo` is undefined, whereas `prop` is a function that returns a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop['bar']
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop['bar']` is undefined, whereas `prop` is a function that returns a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.baz()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.baz()` is undefined, whereas `prop` is a function that returns a value.

DONE.
