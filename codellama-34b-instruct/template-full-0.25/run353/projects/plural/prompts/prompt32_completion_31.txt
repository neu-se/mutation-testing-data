  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is called with a different length argument, which would result in a different output for words that match the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is called with a different length argument, which would result in a different output for words that match the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is called with a different length argument
