  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return `null` instead of an object with the country data, which would cause the `getAllCountries` function to return an empty object instead of an object with all countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return an empty object instead of an object with the country data, which would cause the `getAllCountries` function to return an empty object instead of an object with all countries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ id: 'invalid' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return an object with an invalid country ID, which would cause the `getAllCountries` function to return an object with an invalid country instead of an object with all countries.

DONE.
