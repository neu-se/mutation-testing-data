  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object in non-strict mode, whereas `void 0` would evaluate to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value.

DONE.
