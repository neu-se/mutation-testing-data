 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would always be called, regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? null : 'aborting'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with the string 'aborting' when `abort` is true, instead of not being called at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && onAbort(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with the value of `abort` instead of `abort === true ? null: abort`.

DONE.
