  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at the second argument instead of the first, which could cause the `name` argument to be omitted from the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at the third argument instead of the first, which could cause the `name` and `args` arguments to be omitted from the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at the fourth argument instead of the first, which could cause the `name`, `args`, and `object` arguments to be omitted from the resulting array.

DONE.
