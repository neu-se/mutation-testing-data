  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different function than `fcall` and it would change the functionality of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different function than `fcall` and it would change the functionality of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise instead of resolving it, which would change the control flow of the code.

DONE.
