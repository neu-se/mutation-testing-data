 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[line, otherIter.next(1).attributes || {}, i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the attributes of the next operation from `otherIter` instead of the current `line` and a new empty attributes object. This change would cause the `predicate` function to receive different arguments than in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[line, {}, i + 1]
