  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would no longer be defined on the `String` prototype, causing any code that relies on this function to break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function(num) { return num + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would now always return a value that is one greater than the input value, rather than the correct plural form of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function(num) { throw new Error('Plural function not implemented') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would now always throw an error, rather than returning the correct plural form of the input word.

DONE.
