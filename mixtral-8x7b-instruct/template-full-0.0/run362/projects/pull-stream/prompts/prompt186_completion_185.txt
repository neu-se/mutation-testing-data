 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not being invoked, and the error handling behavior of the original code would not be present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment of the `i` variable is not being performed, leading to an infinite loop and potential stack overflow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument passed to `cb` is expected to be a boolean indicating success or failure, and `false` indicates failure.

DONE.
