  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` before calling the callback, while the mutated code fragment decrements `i` before calling the callback. This change in behavior could potentially cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the specific behavior of the `count` function.

DONE.
