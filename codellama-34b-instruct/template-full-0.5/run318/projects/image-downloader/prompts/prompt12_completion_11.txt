  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the directory name of the `options.dest` path, whereas the original code fragment returns the base name of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the base name of the `options.url` path, whereas the original code fragment returns the base name of the `options.dest` path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the extension name of the `options.url` path, whereas the original code fragment returns the extension name of the `options.dest` path.

DONE.
