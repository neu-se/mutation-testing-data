  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function and `onAbort()` would call the function, whereas `onAbort` by itself would simply refer to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.bind(this)` would create a new function that is bound to the current context, whereas `onAbort` by itself would simply refer to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.call(this)` would call the function with the current context, whereas `onAbort` by itself would simply refer to the function.

DONE.
