  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.property
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access the `property` property of `row`, which may not exist or may have a different value than `row.key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row["key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `key` property of `row` indirectly, rather than directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to retrieve the value associated with `key` from `this._queue`, which may not be the same as the value returned by `row.key`.

DONE.
