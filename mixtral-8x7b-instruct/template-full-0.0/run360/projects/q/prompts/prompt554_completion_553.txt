 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function is not being called, and instead an empty function is being returned. The `when` function is used to handle both fulfilled and rejected promises, so not calling it may lead to unexpected results or errors not being properly handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with its `this` value set to the provided value. If the value of `this` is important in the context where the function is being used, not passing it along could lead to issues. Also, `bind` creates a new function, which may have unintended consequences in terms of memory usage or performance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately invokes the `callback` function with the value, instead of
