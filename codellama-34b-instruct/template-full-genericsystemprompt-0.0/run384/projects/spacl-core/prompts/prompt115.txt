Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
import { Matcher } from './matcher'
import { Queryable, QueryContext } from './queryable'

/** Access-control rule for a single path. */
export class Rule implements Queryable {
  /** Pattern for determining which paths are governed by this rule. */
  readonly regex: Matcher
  /** Set of verbs governed by this rule; allowed verbs
    * are marked as `true`, denied verbs as `false`. */
  readonly verbs: { [index: string]: boolean } = {}

  /** @param spec Path specification or pre-compiled matcher for
    *             determining which paths this rule will apply to. */
  constructor (spec: string | Matcher) {
    this.regex = spec instanceof Matcher
      ? spec
      : new Matcher(spec)
  }

  /** Mark one or more verbs as allowed.
    * @note Deny overrides allow within SPACL policies;
    *       this method will have no effect on verbs
    *       previously marked as denied. */
  allow (...verbs: string[]): Rule {
    for (const verb of verbs) {
      if (!(verb in this.verbs)) {
        this.verbs[verb] = true
      }
    }
    return this
  }

  /** Mark one or more verbs as denied. */
  deny (...verbs: string[]): Rule {
    for (const verb of <PLACEHOLDER>) {
      this.verbs[verb] = false
    }
    return this
  }

  /** Check whether an action is allowed on a path.
    * @param path Path to be acted on.
    * @param verb Action to be performed.
    * @param ctx Query context for resolving context-dependent paths.
    * @returns Returns `true` if the action is explicitly allowed,
    *          `false` if the action is explicitly denied, or
    *          `null` if the combination of path and action
    *          is not governed by this rule. */
  query (path: string, verb: string, ctx?: QueryContext): boolean | null {
    if (this.matches(path, ctx) && verb in this.verbs) {
      return this.verbs[verb]
    }
    return null
  }

  /** Check whether a path is governed by this rule.
    * @param path Path to be checked.
    * @param ctx Query context for resolving context-dependent paths. */
  matches (path: string, ctx?: QueryContext): boolean {
    const match = path.match(this.regex)
    if (match === null) {
      return false
    }
    const count = this.regex.props.length
    if (count > 0) {
      if (ctx === undefined) {
        return false
      }
      for (let index = 0; index < count; index++) {
        const prop = ctx[this.regex.props[index]]
        if (prop === undefined || match[index + 1] !== prop) {
          return false
        }
      }
    }
    return true
  }

  /** Create clone of a rule.
    * @param spec Replacement path specification for the new rule. */
  clone (spec: string | Matcher = this.regex): Rule {
    const rule = new Rule(spec)
    for (const verb in this.verbs) {
      rule.verbs[verb] = this.verbs[verb]
    }
    return rule
  }

  /** Static constructor function; returns a new Rule.
    * @param spec Path specification or pre-compiled matcher for
    *             determining which paths this rule will apply to. */
  static for (spec: string | Matcher): Rule {
    return new Rule(spec)
  }
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
verbs
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
