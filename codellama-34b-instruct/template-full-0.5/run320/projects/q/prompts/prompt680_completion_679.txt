  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` is now `2`, which would omit the first argument to `Q.fcall`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` is now `0`, which would include all arguments to `Q.fcall`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` is now `1, 2`, which would omit the first argument and include only the second argument to `Q.fcall`.

DONE.
