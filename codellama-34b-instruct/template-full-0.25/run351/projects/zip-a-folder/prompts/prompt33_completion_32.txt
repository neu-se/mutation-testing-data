  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, while `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, while `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', () => {
  console.log('An error occurred');
});
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment logs a message to the console when an error occurs, while the original code fragment rejects the promise with an error.

DONE.
