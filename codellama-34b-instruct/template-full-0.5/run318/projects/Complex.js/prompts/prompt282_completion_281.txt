  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator changes the sign of the value, which would affect the resulting complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator multiplies the value by itself, which would change the resulting complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the value, which would change the resulting complex number.

DONE.
