Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `Complex['NAN']` if either of the complex numbers is infinite, rather than requiring both to be infinite as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it will now return `Complex['NAN']` when both complex numbers are zero, which is not the intended behavior of the original code that checks for infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `Complex['NAN']` when the first complex number is infinite and the second is not, which is a different condition than the original check for both being infinite.

DONE.
