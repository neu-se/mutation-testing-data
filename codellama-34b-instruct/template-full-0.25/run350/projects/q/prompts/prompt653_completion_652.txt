  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is called with a different second argument, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is called with a different second argument, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is called with a different second argument, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

DONE.
