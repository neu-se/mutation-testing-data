  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the value of `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the value of `i` by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would reset the value of `i` to 0 instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to repeat indefinitely.

DONE.
