 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the reciprocal of the cosine would be used instead, potentially leading to incorrect results when the cosine is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the arc cosine would be used instead, which is not the same as the original cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(Math.log(Math.cos))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logarithm and exponential functions to compute the cosine, which may introduce rounding errors and is less efficient than the original implementation.

DONE.
