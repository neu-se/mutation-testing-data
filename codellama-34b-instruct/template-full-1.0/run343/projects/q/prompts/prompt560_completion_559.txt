  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "done"
```
This would result in different behavior because "done" is a different operation than "when" and would cause the method to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && args[0] === "then"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return a value if the operation is "when" and the first argument is "then", which is not always the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "error"
```
This would result in different behavior because "error" is a different operation than "when" and would cause the method to return the wrong value.

DONE.
