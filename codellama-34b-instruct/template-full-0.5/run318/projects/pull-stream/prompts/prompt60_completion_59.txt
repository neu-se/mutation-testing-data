  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `sink.abort` function, but this replacement calls the function, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort = function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `sink.abort` function, but this replacement overrides the function with an empty function, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort = function (err, cb) {
  if (err) {
    cb(err);
  } else {
    cb();
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `sink.abort` function, but this replacement overrides the function with a new implementation that only calls the callback
