  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would not be called with the `true` option, which would cause the function to not remove the query string from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would be called with a null value, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would be called with the `1` option, which would cause the function to remove the query string from the URL and replace it with a `1`.

DONE.
