  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `done` callback is null, which is not the same as checking if it is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `done` callback is undefined, which is not the same as checking if it is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `done` callback is false, which is not the same as checking if it is not provided.

DONE.
