  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, if either `this` or `z` is infinite, the result is `Complex.INFINITY`, while in this modified code, if both `this` and `z` are infinite, the result is `Complex.NAN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNegative']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, if either `this` or `z` is infinite, the result is `Complex.INFINITY`, while in this modified code, if `this` is negative and `z` is infinite, the result is `Complex.NAN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && this['abs']() > z['abs']()
```
This would result in different
