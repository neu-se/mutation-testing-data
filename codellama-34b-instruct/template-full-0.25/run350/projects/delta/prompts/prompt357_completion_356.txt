  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether the argument is equal to 0, while the modified code fragment is checking whether the argument plus 1 is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether the argument is equal to 0, while the modified code fragment is checking whether the argument minus 1 is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether the argument is equal to 0, while the modified code fragment is checking whether the argument multiplied by 2 is equal to 0.

DONE.
