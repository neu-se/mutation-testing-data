  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset value would be incremented by 1, which would cause the utcOffsetStr and dstOffsetStr methods to generate different output values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset value used in the utcOffsetStr and dstOffsetStr methods would be different, which could cause the generated output values to differ.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-utcOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset value used in the utcOffsetStr and dstOffsetStr methods would be negative, which could cause the generated output values to differ.

DONE.
