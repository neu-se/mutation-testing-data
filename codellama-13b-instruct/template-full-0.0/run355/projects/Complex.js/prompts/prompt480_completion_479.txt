  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is called instead of `isNaN`, which would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method is called instead of `isNaN`, which would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is called instead of `isNaN`, which would return a different result.

DONE.
