  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the given code with buggy code fragments that have different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort || undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `undefined`, even if `onAbort` is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `abort` if `onAbort` is truthy, but not necessarily the same value as `abort` if `onAbort` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort ? abort : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `abort` if `onAbort` is truthy, but `null` if `onAbort` is falsy, unlike the original code which always evaluates to `abort` or `null` regardless of the value of
