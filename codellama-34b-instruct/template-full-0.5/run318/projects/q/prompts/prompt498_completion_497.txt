  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as an additional argument to the `untrackRejection` function, which would cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as an additional argument to the `untrackRejection` function, which would cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, null, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the second argument to the `untrackRejection` function, which would cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
