  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && (priority || otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'` instead of `'delete'`, which would cause the `transform` method to behave differently when both deltas have insert operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && (priority || otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'` instead of `'insert'`, which would cause the `transform` method to behave differently when both deltas have insert operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && (priority || otherIter.peekType() !== 'retain')
