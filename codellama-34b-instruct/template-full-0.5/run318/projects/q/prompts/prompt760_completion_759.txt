  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` only returns the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `array_map` returns a new array with the results of calling the provided function on every element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value, whereas `array_map` returns a new array with the results of calling the provided function on every element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_fill
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_fill` fills all the elements of an array from a start index to an end index with a static value, whereas `array_map` returns a new array with the results of calling the provided function on every element.

DONE.
