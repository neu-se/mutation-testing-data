 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function will be called with a null argument, which could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'https://www.example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function will be called with a string argument that has a protocol, which could cause the function to behave differently than when it is called with a base URL that does not have a protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ url: 'https://www.example.com' }
