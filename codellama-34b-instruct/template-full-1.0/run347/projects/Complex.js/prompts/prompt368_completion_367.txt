  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `-b` returns the negative value of the variable `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `2*b` returns twice the value of the variable `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `b*b` returns the square of the value of the variable `b`.

DONE.
