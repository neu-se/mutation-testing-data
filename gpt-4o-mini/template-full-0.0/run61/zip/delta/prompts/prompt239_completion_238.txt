Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the delete operation to always delete zero characters, effectively making it a no-op, which could lead to incorrect results when comparing the two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete one more character than available, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrect state in the delta if the length of `thisIter` is less than or equal to the length of the component.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete one extra character than intended, which could lead to data loss or incorrect delta composition when the lengths of the operations do not match.

DONE.
