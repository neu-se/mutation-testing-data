  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called with two arguments instead of one, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called with two arguments instead of one, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called with two arguments instead of one, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
