  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if `flushing` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if `flushing` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing ? false : true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to the opposite of `flushing`, regardless of its value.

DONE.
