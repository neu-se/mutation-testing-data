  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `notOk` is the opposite of `ok`, so it would falsify the condition even if the condition is true, causing the code to enter the `if` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `||` is the logical OR operator, which returns `true` if either of the operands is truthy. In this case, it would return `true` regardless of the value of `ses.ok`, causing the condition to pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `&&` is the logical AND operator, which returns `true` if both operands are truthy. In this case, it would return `false` regardless of the value of `ses.ok`, causing the condition to fail.

DONE.
