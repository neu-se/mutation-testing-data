  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` would return a tuple with the values `1` and `a`, while the modified code fragment `a + 1` would return the sum of `a` and `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` would return a tuple with the values `1` and `a`, while the modified code fragment `a - 1` would return the difference of `a` and `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` would return a tuple with the values `1` and `a`, while the modified code fragment `a * 2` would return the product of `a` and `2`.

DONE.
