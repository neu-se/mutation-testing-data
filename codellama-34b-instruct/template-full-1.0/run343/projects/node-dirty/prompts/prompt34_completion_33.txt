  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the `cb` function immediately, whereas the original code fragment would only invoke it when the `_writeStream` is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the key from the `_data` map without invoking the `cb` function, whereas the original code fragment would only delete the key if the `cb` function is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the value associated with the key from the `_data` map, whereas the original code fragment would only retrieve the value if the `cb` function is not provided.

DONE.
