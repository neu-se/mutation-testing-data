  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the event handler would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the event handler would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is the same, but the event handler would not be called because the `if` statement checks for a specific error message.

DONE.
