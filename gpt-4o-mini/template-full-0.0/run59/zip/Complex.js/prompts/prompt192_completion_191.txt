Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the exponent from `b` to `b + 1`, which would affect the result of the power calculation, potentially leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the exponent, which would significantly alter the outcome of the power operation, especially for values of `b` that are not zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it halves the exponent, which could lead to unexpected results in the power calculation, particularly when `b` is a positive number.

DONE.
