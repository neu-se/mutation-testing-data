  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) - Math.exp(-x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `cosh` function, which is defined as `Math.exp(x) + Math.exp(-x)`. Replacing `Math.exp` with `Math.exp(x) - Math.exp(-x)` would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) + Math.exp(-x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `sinh` function, which is defined as `Math.exp(x) - Math.exp(-x)`. Replacing `Math.exp` with `Math.exp(x) + Math.exp(-x)` would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) * Math.exp(-x)
```
This would result in different
