  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<NaN>
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function, but `<NaN>` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<undefined>
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function, but `<undefined>` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<empty>
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function, but `<empty>` is not.

DONE.
