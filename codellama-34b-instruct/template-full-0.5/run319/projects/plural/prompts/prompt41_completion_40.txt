  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr` and `w.substring` are different methods in JavaScript, and the former returns a new string from a specified position to the end of the string, while the latter returns a new string from a specified position with a specified length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr` and `w.slice` are different methods in JavaScript, and the former returns a new string from a specified position to the end of the string, while the latter returns a new string from a specified position with a specified length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr(0, w.length - 1)` and `w.substr(1)` are different methods in JavaScript, and the former returns a new string from a specified position to the end of the string, while
