  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "post" method would be replaced with the "get" method, which has a different functionality. The "get" method returns the value of a property, while the "post" method sets the value of a property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "post" method would be replaced with an undefined function, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "post" method would be replaced with an array that contains the name of the method and the arguments to pass to it. This would result in a different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "dispatch" method, which is not present in the replaced code.

DONE.
