  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `reason.stack` to get the stack trace of the error, while the new code fragment uses `reason.message` to get the error message. The `message` property is a string that describes the error, while the `stack` property is a string that represents the stack trace of the error. Using `reason.message` instead of `reason.stack` would result in a different error message being displayed.
