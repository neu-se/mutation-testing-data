  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("The options.dest is not a string")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code would still fail if the `options.dest` parameter is not a string, but the error message would be misleading.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("The options.dest is not a function")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code would still fail if the `options.dest` parameter is not a function, but the error message would be misleading.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("The options.dest is not a valid destination")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code would still fail if the `options.dest` parameter is not a valid destination, but the error message would be more informative and helpful to the user.

DONE.
