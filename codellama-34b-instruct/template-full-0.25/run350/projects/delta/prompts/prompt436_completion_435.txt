  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, but this replacement checks if it's a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.delete` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, but this replacement checks if it's an object. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.delete` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, but this replacement checks if it's undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.delete` is undefined.
