  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds an element at a specific index in the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.concat(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the original array with the new element, whereas `push` modifies the original array by adding the new element to the end.

DONE.
