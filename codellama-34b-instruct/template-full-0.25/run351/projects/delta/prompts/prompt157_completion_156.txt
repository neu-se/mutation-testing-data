  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this replacement checks if it is a delete. This could cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this replacement checks if it is a retain. This could cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekLength() > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this replacement checks if it is an insert with a length greater than 1. This could cause the
