  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new pattern matches any zero or more characters, while the original pattern matches one or more characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:[a-zA-Z]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new pattern only matches letters, while the original pattern matches any character except for a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.+}/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new pattern matches one or more characters followed by a closing curly brace, while the original pattern matches any character except for a forward slash.

DONE.
