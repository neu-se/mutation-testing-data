  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is set to `false`, which means that the query string will not be parsed. This could cause the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object to be empty, which would affect the rest of the code that relies on that property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is set to `false`, which means that the fragment (i.e., the part of the URL after the `#` symbol) will not be parsed. This could cause the `hash` property of the `parsedUrl` object to be empty, which would affect the rest of the code that relies on that property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because
