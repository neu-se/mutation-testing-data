 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method is removed, and the callback is directly called with the `value`. This could cause issues if the `callback` is asynchronous and expects a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(callback(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because a new promise is created by calling `Promise.resolve` with the result of the `callback(value)` call. This could cause issues if the `callback` is asynchronous and depends on the context of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.fcall(Promise.resolve(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is used instead of `call`, and `Promise.resolve(value)` is passed as an argument to the `callback`. This could cause issues if the `callback` is expecting a non-
