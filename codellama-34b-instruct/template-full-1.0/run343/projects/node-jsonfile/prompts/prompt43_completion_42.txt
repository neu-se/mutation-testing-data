  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` instead of the actual object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `undefined` instead of the actual object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `0` instead of the actual object.

DONE.
