 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '' || c === '\t' || c === '\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat an empty string as whitespace, potentially causing issues in the parsing of complex numbers from strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat carriage return characters as whitespace, potentially causing issues in the parsing of complex numbers from strings in certain environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '\u00A0' || c === '\u0009' || c === '\u000A'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider specific Unicode whitespace characters as valid, potentially causing issues in the parsing of complex numbers from strings with different whitespace characters.

DONE.
