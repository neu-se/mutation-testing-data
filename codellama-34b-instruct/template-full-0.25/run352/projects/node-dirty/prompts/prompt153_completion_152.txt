  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` will close the write stream, whereas `uncork()` will resume writing to the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('');
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` will write an empty string to the stream, whereas `uncork()` will resume writing to the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` will pause writing to the stream, whereas `uncork()` will resume writing to the stream.

DONE.
