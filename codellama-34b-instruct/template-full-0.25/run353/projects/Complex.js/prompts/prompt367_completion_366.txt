  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant value that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and it is not related to the calculation of the complex arcus cosecans.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` calculates the square root of a number, which is not related to the calculation of the complex arcus cosecans.

DONE.
