  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, done
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `drain` function to receive a different argument than it was originally designed to handle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `drain` function to receive two `null` arguments instead of one `null` and one function argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return done; }, done
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `drain` function to receive a function argument that returns the `done` function instead of the `null` argument that it was originally designed to handle.

DONE.
