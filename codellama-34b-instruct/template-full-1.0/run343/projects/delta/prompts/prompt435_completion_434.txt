  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the strict inequality operator is different from the non-strict inequality operator used in the original code, which means that the behavior would be different if the length of the op was exactly equal to the offset.  

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is inverted, meaning that the length check would be opposite of what it should be in the original code.  

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + offset < opLength
```
This would result in different behavior because the + operator is different from the - operator used in the original code, and the length check would be opposite of what it should be in the original code.  

DONE.
