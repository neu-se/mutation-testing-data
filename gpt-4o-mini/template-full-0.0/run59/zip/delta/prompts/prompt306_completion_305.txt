Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of the `ops` array in the `line` object instead of the number of elements in the `line` Delta, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the last line if `line` has no operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the length of the `line`, which could cause the predicate to be called even when there are no actual lines to process, leading to unexpected behavior in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the length of the `line`, which could cause the predicate to be skipped if the `line` has only one operation, potentially omitting the last line from processing.

DONE.
