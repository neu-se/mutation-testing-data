  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate one extra time, which may cause the code to behave differently than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > len
```
This change will cause the loop to never iterate, which may cause the code to behave differently than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i != len
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate until the condition is no longer true, which may cause the code to behave differently than intended.

DONE.
