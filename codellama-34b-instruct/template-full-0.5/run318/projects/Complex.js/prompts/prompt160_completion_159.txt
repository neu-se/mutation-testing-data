  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` returns true if the number is not a number, while `isInfinite` returns true if the number is positive or negative infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the divisor is infinite, rather than the dividend.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the divisor is zero, rather than checking if the number is infinite.

DONE.
