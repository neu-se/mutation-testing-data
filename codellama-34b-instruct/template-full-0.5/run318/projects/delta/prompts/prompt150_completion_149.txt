  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next value in the iterator without advancing it, whereas `next()` returns the next value and advances the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek(1)` returns the next value in the iterator without advancing it, whereas `next()` returns the next value and advances the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(1)` returns the next value in the iterator and advances it by 1, whereas `next()` returns the next value and advances the iterator.

DONE.
