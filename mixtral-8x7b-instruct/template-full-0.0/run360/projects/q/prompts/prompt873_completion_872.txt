 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return callback.bind(this); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with the `this` value set to a specific object and with pre-specified arguments. In this case, the returned promise would not have the correct `this` value and might cause issues if the `callback` function relies on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return callback.call(null); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method changes the `this` value of the function to the provided value and invokes the function with a given list of arguments. In this case, the `callback` function would be invoked immediately with a `this` value of `null`, which might cause issues if the function relies on the correct `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return callback.apply(null, []); }
