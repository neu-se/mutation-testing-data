  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `value` as a resolved promise, while the mutated code fragment returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `value` as a resolved promise, while the mutated code fragment returns `null` as a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `value` as a resolved promise, while the mutated code fragment returns a rejected promise with an `Error` object.

DONE.
