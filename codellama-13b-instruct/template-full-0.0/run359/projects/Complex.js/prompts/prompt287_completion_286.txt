  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is used instead of `sin`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function is used instead of `sin`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is used instead of `sin`.

DONE.
