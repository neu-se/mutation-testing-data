  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'mouse', 'mice'`, which adds the plural form of the word "mouse" to the list of rules, while the new code fragment adds the word "mice" twice, which would result in an incorrect plural form for the word "mouse".
