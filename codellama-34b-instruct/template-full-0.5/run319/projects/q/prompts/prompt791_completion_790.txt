  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected immediately, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved immediately, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('rejected')
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a new error object, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
