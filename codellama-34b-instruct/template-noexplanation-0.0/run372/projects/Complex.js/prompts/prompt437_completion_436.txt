  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This change will ensure that the `places` variable is never `0`, which could cause the `Math.pow` function to return `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 0.1
```
This change will ensure that the `places` variable is never `0`, which could cause the `Math.pow` function to return `NaN`. Additionally, it will ensure that the `places` variable is never too small, which could cause the `Math.pow` function to return a value that is too large.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 100
```
This change will ensure that the `places` variable is never `0`, which could cause the `Math.pow` function to return `NaN`. Additionally, it will ensure that the `places` variable is never too large, which could cause the `Math.pow` function to
