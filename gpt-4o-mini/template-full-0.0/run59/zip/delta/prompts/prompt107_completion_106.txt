Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(predicate);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from mapping (transforming each element) to filtering (selecting elements based on a condition), which alters the output type and content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map((op, index) => op.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the mapping function to only return the `insert` property of each operation, potentially resulting in an array of `undefined` values if `insert` is not present, rather than the original operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map((op, index) => op.retain + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the mapping to increment the `retain` property of each operation by 1, which could lead to incorrect values being returned if `retain` is not a number or is not defined.

DONE.
