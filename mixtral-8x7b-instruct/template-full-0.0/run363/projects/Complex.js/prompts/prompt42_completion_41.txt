 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b * b + a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could lead to different results due to floating-point arithmetic quirks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a) * Math.abs(a) + Math.abs(b) * Math.abs(b)
