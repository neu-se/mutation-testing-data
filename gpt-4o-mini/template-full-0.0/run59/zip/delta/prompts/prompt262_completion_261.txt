Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the attributes from `otherOp` instead of `thisOp`, potentially leading to incorrect attribute comparisons during the diff operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the attributes with `null`, which would cause the diff operation to ignore any attributes from `thisOp`, leading to incorrect diff results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ invalid: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an invalid attributes object, which could cause unexpected behavior in the diff logic, as it would not match any valid attributes and may lead to errors or incorrect operations.

DONE.
