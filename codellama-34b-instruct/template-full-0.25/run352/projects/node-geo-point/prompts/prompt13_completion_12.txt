  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an array of length 1 to be passed as a coordinate, which is not a valid coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an array of length 3 or more to be passed as a coordinate, which is not a valid coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an empty array to be passed as a coordinate, which is not a valid coordinate.

DONE.
