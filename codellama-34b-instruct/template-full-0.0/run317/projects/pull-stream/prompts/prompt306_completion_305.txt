  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to `end`, regardless of whether `ended` was already true or not. In the original code, `ended` is only set to `end` if `ended` is already true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to the opposite of `end`, regardless of whether `ended` was already true or not. In the original code, `ended` is only set to `end` if `ended` is already true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end && !ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set `ended` to `end` if `ended` was already true. In the original code, `ended` is set to `end` regardless of whether `ended` was already true or not.

DONE.
