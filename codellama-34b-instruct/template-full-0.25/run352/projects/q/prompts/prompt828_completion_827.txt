  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the `onerror` callback from being called, which could cause errors to be silently ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Q error"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error whenever the `onerror` callback is called, which could cause the program to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { console.log("Q error"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log an error message to the console whenever the `onerror` callback is called, but it would not prevent the program from continuing to run.

DONE.
