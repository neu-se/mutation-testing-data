  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set` would throw an error when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method of `null`, whereas the original code would use the `promiseDispatch` method of the object passed as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set` would throw an error when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method of `undefined`, whereas the original code would use the `promiseDispatch` method of the object passed as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set` would throw an error when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method of an empty object, whereas the original code would use the `promiseDispatch` method of the object passed as the first argument.

DONE.
