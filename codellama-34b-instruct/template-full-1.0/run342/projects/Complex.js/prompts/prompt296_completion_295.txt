  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square of `a`, while this code calculates the square of `2a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square of `a`, while this code calculates the square of `a - 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square of `a`, while this code calculates the square of `2a + 1`.

DONE.
