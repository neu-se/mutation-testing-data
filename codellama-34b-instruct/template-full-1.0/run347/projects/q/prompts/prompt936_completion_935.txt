  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` instead of a slice of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined` instead of a slice of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the arguments instead of a slice of the arguments.

DONE.
