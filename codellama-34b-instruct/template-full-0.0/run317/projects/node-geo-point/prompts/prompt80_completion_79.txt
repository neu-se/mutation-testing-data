  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the longitude of the coordinate, while this replacement uses the sum of the longitudes of the two coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 - λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the longitude of the coordinate, while this replacement uses the difference of the longitudes of the two coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 * λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the longitude of the coordinate, while this replacement uses the product of the longitudes of the two coordinates.

DONE.
