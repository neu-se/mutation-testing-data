  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, and `defer(null)` would return a promise that is already resolved with the value `null`.

This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, and `defer(undefined)` would return a promise that is already resolved with the value `undefined`. This would cause the `then` method to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would not be the same as the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, and `defer(
