  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http:/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the correct protocol separator `//` after `http:`, whereas this modified code would produce an incorrect protocol of `http:/`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `http:` protocol, whereas this modified code would use the `https:` protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not include the `www.` subdomain, whereas this modified code would include it.

DONE.
