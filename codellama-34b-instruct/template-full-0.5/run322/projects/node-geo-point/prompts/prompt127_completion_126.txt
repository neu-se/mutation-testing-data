  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the longitude of the point instead of the point itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the latitude of the point instead of the point itself, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude * point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the longitude and latitude of the point, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
