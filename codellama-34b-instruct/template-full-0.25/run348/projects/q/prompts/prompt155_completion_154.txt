  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase()` would convert the string returned by `filterStackString()` to lowercase, which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the original case of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would remove the first character of the string returned by `filterStackString()`, which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterStackString.replace("filterStackString", "newFunction")
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace()` would replace all occurrences of "filterStackString" in the string returned by `filterStackString()` with "newFunction", which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the original string.

DONE.
