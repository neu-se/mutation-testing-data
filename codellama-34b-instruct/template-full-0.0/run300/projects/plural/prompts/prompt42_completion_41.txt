  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would start from the second character instead of the first, which would cause the pluralization of words like "cactus" to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would start from the last character instead of the first, which would cause the pluralization of words like "cactus" to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would start from a random position in the string, which would cause the pluralization of words like "cactus" to be incorrect.

DONE.
