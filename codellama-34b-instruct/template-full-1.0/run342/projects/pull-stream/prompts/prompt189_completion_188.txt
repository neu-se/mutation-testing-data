  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the wrong value if the input array contains duplicate elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, array[i+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different index than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different index than the original code.

DONE.
