  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is checking if the index is negative. However, the replaced code fragment checks if the index is greater than 0, which means it is checking if the index is positive. This change in behavior could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios.

DONE.
