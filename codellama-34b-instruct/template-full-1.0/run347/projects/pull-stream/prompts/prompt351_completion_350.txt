  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the test function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, which would likely result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the test function to be called with an additional argument, which would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the test function to be called with the value of the `foo` property of the `test` object, rather than the value of the `test` object itself.

DONE.
