  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `targetBasePath` variable is not being checked for write permission with the `fs.constants.W_OK` constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `targetBasePath` variable is not being checked for read permission with the `fs.constants.R_OK` constant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(src), fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is being used to get the directory name with `path.dirname`, instead of `targetBasePath`.

DONE.
