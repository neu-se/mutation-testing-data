  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of new Map()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Map()` creates a new, empty map instead of using the existing `_data` map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of one_constant) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `one_constant` does not exist, so it would raise a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of (this._data).hello) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `hello` is not a valid method on a map object, so it would raise a `TypeError`.

DONE.
