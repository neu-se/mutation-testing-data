  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, name
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments would be passed in the wrong order, causing the method to be called with the wrong parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + args
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments would be concatenated with the method name, causing the method to be called with a different signature.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because only the first argument would be passed to the method, causing it to be called with a different set of parameters.

DONE.
