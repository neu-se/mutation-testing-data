  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty` is a function, and calling it with the argument `'longitude'` would return `true` if the `object` has a property called `'longitude'`, regardless of whether it is an own property or an inherited property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty` is a function, and calling it with the argument `'longitude'` would return `true` if the `object` has a property called `'longitude'`, regardless of whether it is an own property or an inherited property.
