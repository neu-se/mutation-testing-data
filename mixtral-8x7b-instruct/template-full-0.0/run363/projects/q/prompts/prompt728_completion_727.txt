 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise might be fulfilled with `null` instead of the original resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be rejected instead of being fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises[index] = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would be replaced with an empty object, and the original resolved value would be lost.

DONE.
