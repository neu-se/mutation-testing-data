 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / _b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a division by zero error when `b` is 0, while the original code correctly returns `Math.log(_a)` in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(-_b * _b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a complex number instead of a real number when `b` is non-zero, while the original code returns the real number `Math.log(hypot(_a, _b))`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(_b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive number, while the original code returns a negative number when `b` is negative. This could lead to incorrect results when computing the logarithm.

DONE.
