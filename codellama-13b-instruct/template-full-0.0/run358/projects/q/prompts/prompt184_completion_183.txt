  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `["1", <PLACEHOLDER>]` instead of `["filename", <PLACEHOLDER>]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"filename"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `["filename", <PLACEHOLDER>]` instead of `["1", <PLACEHOLDER>]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"filename:lineNumber"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `["filename:lineNumber", <PLACEHOLDER>]` instead of `["filename", <PLACEHOLDER>]`.

DONE.
