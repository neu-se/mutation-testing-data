  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Unhandled rejection");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which would be handled by the `untrackRejection` function and removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
