  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, while `Math.pow` returns the value of a number raised to a power. In the context of the code, `Math.sqrt` would cause the `x` and `y` values to be calculated incorrectly, leading to a different tile being returned.
