  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!aborted` operator would return `false` if `aborted` is `true`, and `true` if `aborted` is `false`, which would cause the code to behave differently in the case of an abort.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted && true` would return `true` if `aborted` is `true`, and `false` if `aborted` is `false`, which would cause the code to behave differently in the case of an abort.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(aborted == true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `(aborted == true)` would return `true` if `aborted` is `true`, and `false` if `aborted` is `false`, which would cause the code to behave differently in the case of an abort.
