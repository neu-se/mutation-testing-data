 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1.6
```
This would result in different behavior because the zoom level would be limited to 1, 2, or 3, causing incorrect tile calculations for higher zoom levels.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the tile calculation would be based on Euler's number (approximately 2.71828) instead of 2, leading to incorrect tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the tile calculation would not account for the curvature of the Earth, leading to incorrect tile coordinates for higher latitudes.

DONE.
