  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment that called `cb` with `err` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `err` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment that called `cb` with `null` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as both arguments, which is not the same as the original code fragment that called `cb` with `err` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument.

DONE.
