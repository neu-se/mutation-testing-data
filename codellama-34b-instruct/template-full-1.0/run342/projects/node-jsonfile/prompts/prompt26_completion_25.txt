  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` would throw an error when the input is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` would return an empty object instead of the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` would return an array instead of the expected object.

DONE.
