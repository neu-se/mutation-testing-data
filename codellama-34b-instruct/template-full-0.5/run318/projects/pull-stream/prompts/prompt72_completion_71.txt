  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable, while `null` is a constant. The function `op` may have different behavior when passed a constant value than when passed a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable, while `undefined` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. The function `op` may have different behavior when passed `undefined` than when passed a variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable, while `1` is a constant. The function `op` may have different behavior when passed a constant value than when passed a variable.

DONE.
