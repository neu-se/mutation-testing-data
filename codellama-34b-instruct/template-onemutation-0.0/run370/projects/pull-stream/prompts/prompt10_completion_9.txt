  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the function `a` has a length of 1, while the new code fragment checks if it has a length of 2. This change would cause the function to behave differently for functions with a length of 2 or more.

DONE.
