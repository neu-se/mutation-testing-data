  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || latitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the latitude is less than -90 or greater than 90, but the new code fragment also checks if the latitude is equal to 0. This would cause the code to throw a RangeError for a different set of input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || longitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the latitude is less than -90 or greater than 90, but the new code fragment also checks if the longitude is equal to 0. This would cause the code to throw a RangeError for a different set of input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || bearing === 0
```
This would result in different
