  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.hostname` is a different property than `ret.host`, and it may not be defined in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.replace('www.', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the `www.` prefix from the hostname, which may not be desired.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.split('.').slice(-2).join('.')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the last two parts of the hostname, which may not be the same as the original hostname.

DONE.
