 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the Q module would always return an empty object, instead of the actual Q object with its methods and properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Manual error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the Q module would throw an error upon initialization, interrupting the normal flow of the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { noop.prototype.qMethod = function () { return; }; return noop; }
