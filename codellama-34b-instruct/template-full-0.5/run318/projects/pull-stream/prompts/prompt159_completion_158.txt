  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `_value` is being returned, while the new code fragment `_value + 1` is returning a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `_value` is being returned, while the new code fragment `value` is returning a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `_value` is being returned, while the new code fragment `null` is returning a different value.

DONE.
