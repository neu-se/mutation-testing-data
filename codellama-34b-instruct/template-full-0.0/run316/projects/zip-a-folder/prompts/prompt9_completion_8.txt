  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function checks if the input is a glob pattern, and the original code fragment checks if the input is not a glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the input string contains the specified substring, and the original code fragment checks if the input is not a glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.match(/[*?]/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method checks if the input string matches the specified regular expression, and the original code fragment checks if the input is not a glob pattern.

DONE.
