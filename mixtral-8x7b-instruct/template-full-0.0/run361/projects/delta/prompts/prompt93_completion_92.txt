 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds the new element to the beginning of the array, rather than the end as with `push`. This could cause issues in the order of operations, leading to unexpected behavior in the `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` can add or remove elements from an array at a specified index, rather than just adding an element at the end. This could lead to unexpected changes in the `ops` array, causing issues in the `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.length = 0;
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it first resets the `ops` array to be empty, and then adds the new operation. This could cause issues in
