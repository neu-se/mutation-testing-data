  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` would be replaced with `null`, which would cause the `JSON.stringify()` method to return `null` instead of a string representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` would be replaced with an empty object `{}`, which would cause the `JSON.stringify()` method to return an empty string instead of a string representation of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` would be replaced with an empty array `[]`, which would cause the `JSON.stringify()` method to return an empty string instead of a string representation of the object.

DONE.
