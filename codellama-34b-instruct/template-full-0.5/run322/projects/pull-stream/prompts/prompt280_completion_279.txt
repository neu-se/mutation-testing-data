  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `mapper.call(this, data)` would call the `mapper` function with the `data` argument, but it would also set the `this` value of the `mapper` function to the `this` value of the current context, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because `mapper.apply(this, [data])` would call the `ma
