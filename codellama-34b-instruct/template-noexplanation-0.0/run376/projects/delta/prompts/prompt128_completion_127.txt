  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index + 1
```
This change will cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the `ops` array, which may expose bugs in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index - 1
```
This change will cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the `ops` array, which may expose bugs in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index + 2
```
This change will cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the `ops` array, which may expose bugs in the test suite.

DONE.
