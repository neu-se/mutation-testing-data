  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is not a valid verb for a generator, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because "throw" is not a valid verb for a generator, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because "yield" is a valid verb for a generator, and would cause the generator to yield a value.

DONE.
