  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `values.forEach` would iterate over the elements of the `values` array, but would not return a new array with the transformed elements, unlike `values.map` which returns a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because `values.filter(Boolean)` would return a new array containing only the truthy elements of `values`, whereas `values.map` would return a new array containing all the elements of `values`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `values.slice()` would return a shallow copy of the `values` array, whereas `values.map` would return a new array containing the transformed elements.

DONE.
