  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `emit` method would be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment, as the event name is the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `emit` method would be called with a different argument.

DONE.
