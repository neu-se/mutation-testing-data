  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then(function () { throw new Error("Test error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to add a rejection handler to the promise returned by `Q.async(makeGenerator)`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error "Test error" instead of being fulfilled with the return value of the generator function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then(function () { return Q.reject("Test error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to add a rejection handler to the promise returned by `Q.async(makeGenerator)`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error "Test error" instead of being fulfilled with the return value of the generator function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
