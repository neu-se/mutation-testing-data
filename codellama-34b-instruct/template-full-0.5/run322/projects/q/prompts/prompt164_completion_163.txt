  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at -1, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at NaN, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
