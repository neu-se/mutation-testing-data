  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push("hello")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the regex `/([^/]+)` onto the `parts` array, but the modified code pushes the string `"hello"` onto the `parts` array. This would cause the method to return a different result, potentially leading to failures in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(/^hello/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the regex `/([^/]+)` onto the `parts` array, but the modified code pushes the regex `/^hello/` onto the `parts` array. This would cause the method to return a different result, potentially leading to failures in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes a regex onto the `parts` array, but the modified code pops the last element off the
