  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `w.length - 2` would return the length of the string minus 2, while the new code fragment `w.length - 1` would return the length of the string minus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `w.length - 2` would return the length of the string minus 2, while the new code fragment `w.length + 1` would return the length of the string plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `w.length - 2` would return the length of the string minus 2, while the new code fragment `w.length * 2` would return the length of the string multiplied by 2.
