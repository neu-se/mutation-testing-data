  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || null
```
This would result in different behavior because if `archiverOptions` is `null` or `undefined`, the original code would use an empty object `{}`, while the new code would use `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `archiverOptions` is falsy (e.g. `null`, `undefined`, `false`, etc.), the original code would use an empty object `{}`, while the new code would use the falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions ?? {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `archiverOptions` is `null` or `undefined`, the original code would use an empty object `{}`, while the new code would use the value of `archiverOptions`.

DONE.
