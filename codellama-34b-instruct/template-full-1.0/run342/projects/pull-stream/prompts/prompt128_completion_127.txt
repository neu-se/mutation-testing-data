  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{urgent: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` returns a boolean value, while the new code fragment `{urgent: true}` returns an object with a single property `urgent` set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` returns a boolean value, while the new code fragment `false` returns a boolean value that is opposite of the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` returns a boolean value, while the new code fragment `null` returns a null value that is different from the original.

DONE.
