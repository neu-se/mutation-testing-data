  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the positive square root, while the new code calculates the negative square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the square root, while the new code calculates the square.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a * a + 1) / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the ratio of the square root to the real part of the complex number, while the new code calculates the ratio of the square root to the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
