  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is an error object that is passed to the `map` function as an argument, while `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an error object, while `err` is an error object that is passed to the `map` function as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('some error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error('some error')` creates a new error object with the message 'some error', while `err` is an error object that is passed to the `map` function as an argument.

DONE.
