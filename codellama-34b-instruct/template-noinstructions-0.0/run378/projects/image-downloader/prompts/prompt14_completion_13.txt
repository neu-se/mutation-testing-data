  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basename` variable as-is, while this replacement uses the lowercase version of the basename. This could cause the code to behave differently if the basename contains uppercase characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basename` variable as-is, while this replacement uses a substring of the basename starting from the second character. This could cause the code to behave differently if the basename is shorter than 2 characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basename` variable as-is, while this replacement uses the first part of the basename split by a dot. This could cause the code to behave differently if the basename contains
