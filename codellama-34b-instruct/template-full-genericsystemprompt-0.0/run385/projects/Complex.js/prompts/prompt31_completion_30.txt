  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result of the `Math.abs()` function to be off by 1, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the result of the `Math.abs()` function to be twice as large, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/ 2` would cause the result of the `Math.abs()` function to be half as large, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

DONE.
