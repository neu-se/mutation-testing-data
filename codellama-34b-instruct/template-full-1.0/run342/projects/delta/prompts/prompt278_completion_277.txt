  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the start index is based on the length of the current op, not the length of the next op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let end = iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the end index is based on the length of the current op, not the length of the next op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const end = iter.peekLength() - Op.length(thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the end index is based on the length of the current op, not the length of the next op.

DONE.
