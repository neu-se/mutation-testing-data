  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that expects a promise and a value, but `null` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(Q.reject(value), value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise with the provided value, which would cause the `deferred.resolve` call to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(Q.resolve(value), value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a resolved promise with the provided value, which would cause the `deferred.resolve` call to succeed.

DONE.
