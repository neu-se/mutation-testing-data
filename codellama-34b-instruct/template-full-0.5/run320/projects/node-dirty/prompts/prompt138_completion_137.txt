  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the value associated with the key, while the new code fragment retrieves the value associated with the key and adds 1 to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the value associated with the key, while the new code fragment retrieves the value associated with the key and multiplies it by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key).toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the value associated with the key, while the new code fragment retrieves the value associated with the key and converts it to a string.

DONE.
