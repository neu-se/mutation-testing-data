 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the line detection logic would be affected, potentially causing incorrect line handling in the `eachLine` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-index
```
This would result in different behavior because the line detection logic would be affected, potentially causing incorrect line handling in the `eachLine` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the line detection logic would be affected, potentially causing incorrect line handling in the `eachLine` method. Additionally, it would introduce non-determinism to the code, making it difficult to predict the outcome.

DONE.
