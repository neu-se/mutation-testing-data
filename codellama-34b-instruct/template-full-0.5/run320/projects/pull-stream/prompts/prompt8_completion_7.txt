  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sources` object is not the same as the `sinks` object, and the loop that iterates over the `sinks` object would not have the same effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throughs` object is not the same as the `sinks` object, and the loop that iterates over the `sinks` object would not have the same effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exports
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exports` object is not the same as the `sinks` object, and the loop that iterates over the `sinks` object would not have the same effect.

DONE.
