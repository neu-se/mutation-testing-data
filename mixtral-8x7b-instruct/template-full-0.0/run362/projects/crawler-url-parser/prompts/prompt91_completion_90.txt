 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(javascript|mailto|ftp):/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regular expression delimiter from `/` to `|`, which may cause unexpected issues if the input string contains the `|` character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp):/g.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the global flag `g`, which changes the behavior of the regular expression to match all occurrences instead of stopping after the first match.
