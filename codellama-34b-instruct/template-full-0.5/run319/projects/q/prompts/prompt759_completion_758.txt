  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "anySettled", "allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name "anySettled" does not exist, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allSettled", "allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name "allResolved" is already being used, so it would cause a naming conflict.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allSettled", "allFulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name "allFulfilled" does not exist, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
