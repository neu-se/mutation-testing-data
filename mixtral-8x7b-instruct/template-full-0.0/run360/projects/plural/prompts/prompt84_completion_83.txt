 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'mouses' as the plural form, but this change would return 'mouses'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `substr` method to remove the last letter of the word and add 'es', but this change would always return 'mice' regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w => w + 'es'
