Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it defaults to an empty object if `op.attributes` is `null` or `undefined`, potentially leading to incorrect attribute handling when inverting operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it defaults to an empty object if `baseOp.attributes` is `null` or `undefined`, which may cause the inversion logic to ignore important attributes that should be preserved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...op.attributes }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of `op.attributes`, which may lead to unintended side effects if the original attributes are modified elsewhere in the code, affecting the integrity of the inversion process.

DONE.
