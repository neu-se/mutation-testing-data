Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.replacer
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the `replacer` function from the `options` object, even if `options` is `null` or `undefined`, potentially causing a TypeError if `options.replacer` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `null` as the replacer function to `JSON.stringify`, regardless of the value of `options.replacer`, potentially changing the output of the stringification process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `reviver` function from the `options` object instead of the `replacer` function, which serves a different purpose in the `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` methods, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
