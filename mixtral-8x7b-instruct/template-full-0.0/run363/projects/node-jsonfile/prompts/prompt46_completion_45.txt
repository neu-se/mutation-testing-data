 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `_fs` variable instead of the `fs` parameter, which could cause issues if the user has provided a custom `fs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.write
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.write` is not a valid function in Node.js's file system module, and would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is not the same as `fs.writeFileSync`. The former returns a string representation of the object, while the latter writes the string to a file. This would cause the function to return the stringified version of the object instead of writing it to a file.

DONE.
