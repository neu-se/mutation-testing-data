 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always choose the `delete` type from `otherIter` instead of checking if the current type from `thisIter` matches the placeholder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately invoke the `peekType` method, consuming the iterator. The original code uses `peekType` without parentheses, which only gets the reference to the function, allowing it to be used in the `while` condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random().toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random string, causing the `while` loop to terminate immediately, and the code would not compare the types of operations in `thisIter` and `otherIter`.

DONE.
