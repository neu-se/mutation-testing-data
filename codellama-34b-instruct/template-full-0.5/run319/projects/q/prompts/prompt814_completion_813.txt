  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `fcall` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the first argument, and has the given arguments prepended to the argument list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

DONE.
