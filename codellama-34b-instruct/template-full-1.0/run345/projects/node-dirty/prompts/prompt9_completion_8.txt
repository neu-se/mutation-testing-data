  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the Map would be different than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the Map would be different than the original value. The multiplication operation would also change the value as opposed to just adding 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, Math.floor(val / 2));
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the Map would be different than the original value. The operation of dividing by two would give a different result than just adding 1.

DONE.
