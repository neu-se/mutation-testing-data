This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called when the promise is resolved, but it is called when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called when the promise is fulfilled, but it is called when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called when the promise is resolved or fulfilled, but it is called when the promise is rejected.

DONE.
