  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `true` would change the parsing mode to `lax`, which allows for relaxed parsing and may result in different URL resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument `false` would change the parsing mode to `strict`, which disables relaxed parsing and may result in different URL resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument `null` would remove the base URL and may change the URL resolution.

DONE.
