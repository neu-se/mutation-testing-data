  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array from a given start and end position, while `array_slice.reverse()` would reverse the order of the elements in the returned array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns an array of elements from the original array, while `array_slice.sort()` would sort the elements in the returned array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns an array of elements from the original array, while `array_slice.pop()` would remove the last element from the returned array.

DONE.
