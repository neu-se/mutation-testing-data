  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes two arguments to the `post` method, while this modified code fragment passes three arguments. This could potentially cause the `post` method to behave differently, depending on how it handles extra arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes two arguments to the `post` method, while this modified code fragment passes three arguments. This could potentially cause the `post` method to behave differently, depending on how it handles extra arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, "foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes two arguments to the `post` method, while this modified code fragment passes three arguments. This could potentially cause the `post` method to behave differently, depending on how it handles extra arguments.
