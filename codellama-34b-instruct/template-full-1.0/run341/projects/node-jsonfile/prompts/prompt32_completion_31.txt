  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a `null` value as the second argument to the `stringify` function, instead of the expected `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options, obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `options` object as the first argument to the `stringify` function, instead of the expected `obj` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `id` property of the `obj` object as the first argument to the `stringify` function, instead of the expected `obj` object.

DONE.
