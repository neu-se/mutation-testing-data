  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel == "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `MessageChannel` object is defined, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `MessageChannel` object is defined and is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `MessageChannel` object is defined and is a function, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not a function.

DONE.
