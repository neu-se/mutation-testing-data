Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'//'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path to a double slash, which could lead to incorrect URL resolution and potentially cause the function to misinterpret the structure of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/index.html'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a specific file name to the path, which could alter the comparison logic and lead to incorrect categorization of the URL type, especially if the original path was intended to be treated as a directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/..'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a parent directory reference, which could change the way the URL is resolved and compared, potentially leading to incorrect results in determining the relationship between the link URL and the page URL.

DONE.
