  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a progress value instead of a fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an undefined value instead of a fulfilled value.

DONE.
