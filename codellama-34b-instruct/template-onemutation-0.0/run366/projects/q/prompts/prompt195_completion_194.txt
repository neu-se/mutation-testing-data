  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3[1]` is the first capture group of the regular expression, which matches the filename, while `attempt3[2]` is the second capture group, which matches the line number. Using `attempt3[1]` would result in the filename being used as the line number, which would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` for all stack lines, even if they are internal frames.
