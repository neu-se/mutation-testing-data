  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.length` would return the length of the `ops` array, which may be different from the current index `this.index`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.index + 1` would return the next index in the `ops` array, which may not be the same as the current index `this.index`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[this.index + 1]` would return the next element in the `ops` array, which may not be the same as the current element `this.ops[this.index]`.

DONE.
