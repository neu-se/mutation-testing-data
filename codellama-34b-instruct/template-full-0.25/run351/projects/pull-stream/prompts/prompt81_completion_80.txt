  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && 'function' == typeof err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `err` is a function if it is truthy, whereas the original code fragment checks if `err` is a function regardless of its truthiness.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' == typeof err || err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `err` is a function and if it is truthy, whereas the original code fragment only checks if `err` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' == typeof err && err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `err` is a function and if it is truthy, whereas the original code fragment only checks if `err` is a function regardless of its truthiness.

DONE.
