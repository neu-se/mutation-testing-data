  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `op` by 1, which could potentially change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of `op` by 1, which could potentially change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `op`, which could potentially change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
