  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has a different output than the `cos` function, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosθ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function has a different output than the `cos` function with an added `1`, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2 - θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI / 2` constant is different from the `θ` variable, which is used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
