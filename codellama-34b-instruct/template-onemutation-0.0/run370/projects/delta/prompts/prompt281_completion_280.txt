  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the `index` variable to be incremented by 1 less than it should be, potentially causing the `eachLine()` method to skip over some lines in the document.
