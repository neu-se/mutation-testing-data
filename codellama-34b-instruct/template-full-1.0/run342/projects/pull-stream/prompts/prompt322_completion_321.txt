  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, and the `onEnd` function would be executed only if `a` is truthy, whereas in the original code it would be executed if `a` is truthy or if `onEnd` is not null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a || onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!a` expression would be evaluated first, and the `||` operator would be applied to the result of that expression and the `onEnd` function. This would cause the `onEnd` function to be called even if `a` is falsy, whereas in the original code it would only be called if `a` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || onEnd(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd(null)` function
