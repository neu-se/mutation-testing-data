  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is used to reject the promise, whereas `resolve` is used to fulfill it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is used to reject the promise, whereas `notify` is used to notify the progress of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is used to reject the promise, whereas `makeNodeResolver` is used to create a new promise resolver.

DONE.
