  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the value to `null` for a policy, regardless of whether the policy has a name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, policy
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the value to `null` for a policy, regardless of whether the policy has a name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the value to the policy itself, regardless of the policy's name.

DONE.
