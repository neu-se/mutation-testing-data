  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.post(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is different from the `get` method used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request(options.url, { method: 'PUT' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `PUT` method is different from the `GET` method used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request(options.url, { method: 'DELETE' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `DELETE` method is different from the `GET` method used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
