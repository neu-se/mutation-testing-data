 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method's second argument (rejected handler) expects a function, and `null` is not a function. This would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method's second argument (rejected handler) expects a function, and `42` is not a function. This would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method's second argument (rejected handler) expects a function that takes a single argument (the rejection reason). The provided function does not take any arguments, so it would not handle the rejection as intended. Instead, it would always return `true`, which is unlikely to be the desired
