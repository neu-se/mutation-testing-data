  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `attributes` property of `lastOp` to `null`, which may cause the `isEqual` function to return `false` even if the two objects have the same attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes = { foo: 'bar' };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `attributes` property of `lastOp` to a new object with a `foo` property set to `'bar'`, which may cause the `isEqual` function to return `false` even if the two objects have the same attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes = { foo: 'baz' };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `attributes` property of `lastOp` to a new object with a `foo` property set to `'baz'`, which may cause the `isEqual
