  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that expects a function as its argument, but `null` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that expects a function as its argument, but `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function () { });
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that expects a function as its argument, and this code fragment provides a function as an argument, but the function does nothing, so it would not have the same effect as the original code fragment.

DONE.
