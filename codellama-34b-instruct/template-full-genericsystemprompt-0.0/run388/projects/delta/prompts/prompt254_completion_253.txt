  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consume one operation from the other iterator, regardless of the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consume the entire length of the current operation from the other iterator, regardless of the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(Math.min(otherIter.peekLength(), length))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume the minimum of the length of the current operation and the length of the current operation from the other iterator, regardless of the length of the current operation.

DONE.
