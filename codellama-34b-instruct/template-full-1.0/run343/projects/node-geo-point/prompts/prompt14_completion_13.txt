  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isInteger` checks if a value is an integer, whereas `Array.isArray` checks if a value is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.is
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.is` checks if two values are the same, whereas `Array.isArray` checks if a value is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof < >
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` checks the data type of a value, whereas `Array.isArray` checks if a value is an array.

DONE.
