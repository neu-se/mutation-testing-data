  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the peeked op is an insert and its length is less than or equal to `firstLeft + 1`, which would cause the code to behave differently if the length of the peeked op is exactly `firstLeft + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the peeked op is an insert and its length is less than or equal to `firstLeft - 1`, which would cause the code to behave differently if the length of the peeked op is exactly `firstLeft - 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
