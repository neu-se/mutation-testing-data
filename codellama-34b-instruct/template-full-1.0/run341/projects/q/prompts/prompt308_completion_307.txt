  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a promise that has not yet been resolved, so it would not behave the same as calling `resolve` which is a function that resolves the promise.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
newFunction
```
This would result in different behavior because `newFunction` is a new function that has not been defined, so it would not behave the same as calling `resolve` which is a function that resolves the promise.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects the promise, so it would not behave the same as calling `resolve` which is a function that resolves the promise.

DONE.
