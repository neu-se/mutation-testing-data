Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the callback function `cb` would cause the abort callback to not execute any of the intended logic, potentially leading to unhandled cases in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of the callback function `cb` would similarly prevent the abort logic from executing properly, which could lead to unexpected results or errors in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `cb` with an empty function would mean that the abort logic is called, but it does nothing, which could mask issues that should be handled by the original callback function.

DONE.
