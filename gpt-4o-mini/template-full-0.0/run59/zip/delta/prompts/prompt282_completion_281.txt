Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always start the search for the newline character from the beginning of the string, potentially missing any newline characters that occur later in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the search for the newline character from the second character of the string, which could lead to skipping the first character and incorrectly processing the string if the first character is a newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to read one more character than is available, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrect processing of the string if the length is already at the end.

DONE.
