  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would cause the promise to be rejected with `deferred.reject` as a rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` would create a new node resolver function, whereas the original code fragment would pass the existing node resolver function to `deferred.reject`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject('error')` would cause the promise to be rejected with the string 'error' as a rejection reason, whereas the original code fragment would pass the value of `deferred.reject` as a rejection reason.

DONE.
