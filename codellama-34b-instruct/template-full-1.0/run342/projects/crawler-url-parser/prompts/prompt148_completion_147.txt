  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split` function to return an array with a single empty string, rather than an array of substrings split by the "/" character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split` function to return an array with a single whitespace-only string, rather than an array of substrings split by the "/" character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split` function to return an array with a single empty string, rather than an array of substrings split by the "/" character.

DONE.
