  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null, data` would pass the `data` argument to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `null, null` would pass `null` as both arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null, data` would pass `null` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument, while the new code fragment `data, null` would pass `data` as the first argument and `null` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null, data` would pass `null` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument, while the new code fragment `undefined, data` would pass `undefined` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument.
