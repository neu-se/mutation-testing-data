  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'end' is emitted when the archive is fully written, while 'close' is emitted when the underlying stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'error' is emitted when an error occurs, while 'close' is emitted when the underlying stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'finish' is emitted when the archive is fully written, while 'close' is emitted when the underlying stream is closed.

DONE.
