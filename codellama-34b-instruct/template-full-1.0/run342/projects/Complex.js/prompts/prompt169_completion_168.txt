  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['ZERO']` even if `z` is not infinite, which would lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['ZERO']` only if both `this` and `z` are zero, which would lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']() && this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['ZERO']` only if `z` is zero and `this` is infinite, which would lead to incorrect results in some cases.

DONE.
