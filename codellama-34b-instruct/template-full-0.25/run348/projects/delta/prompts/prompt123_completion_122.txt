  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator is used instead of `<`, which would cause the loop to iterate one extra time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end || iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the loop to iterate until either the index is greater than or equal to the end or the iterator has no more elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end && !iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used to negate the result of `iter.hasNext()`, which would cause the loop to iterate until the index is greater than or equal to the end and the iterator has no more elements.

DONE.
