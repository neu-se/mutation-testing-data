Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer, while `Math.ceil` rounds up, leading to potentially different results for the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer based on standard rounding rules, which can yield different results compared to `Math.ceil`, especially for values that are not whole numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the calculation by adding 1 to the product before dividing, which would not correctly represent the intended ceiling operation and could lead to incorrect results for the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
