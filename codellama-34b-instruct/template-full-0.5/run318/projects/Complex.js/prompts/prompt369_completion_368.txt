  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh(b)` is the sineh of the imaginary part of the complex number, while `sinh(a)` is the sineh of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh(b)` is the cosineh of the imaginary part of the complex number, while `cosh(a)` is the cosineh of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh(b)` is the tangenth of the imaginary part of the complex number, while `tanh(a)` is the tangenth of the real part.

DONE.
