  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a pass-through stream that doesn't change the value, while the new code fragment `data + 1` would add 1 to the value, which could cause the test suite to fail if the tests are not expecting this change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a pass-through stream that doesn't change the value, while the new code fragment `data * 2` would double the value, which could cause the test suite to fail if the tests are not expecting this change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a pass-through stream that doesn't change the value, while the new code fragment `data.toUpperCase()` would convert the
