Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + x
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from a difference of two values to a sum, which would lead to an incorrect angle calculation for the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * x
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the calculation to a product of the two values instead of using them as coordinates, which would not yield a valid angle for the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a constant subtraction from the y-coordinate, which would skew the angle calculation and potentially lead to incorrect bearing results.

DONE.
