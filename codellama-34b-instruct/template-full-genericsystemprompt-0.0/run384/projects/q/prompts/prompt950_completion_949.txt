  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `dispatch` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError` if `Q.npost` is called with `null` as the `object` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `dispatch` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError` if `Q.npost` is called with `undefined` as the `object` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object `{}` does not have a `dispatch` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError` if `Q.npost` is called with an empty object as the `object` argument.

DONE.
