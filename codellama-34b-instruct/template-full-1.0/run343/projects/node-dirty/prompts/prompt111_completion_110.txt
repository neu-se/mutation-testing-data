  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}, ${this._data.size}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional argument to the `Error` constructor, which would cause the previous version to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${this._data.size}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the `buffer` variable from the error message, which would cause the previous version to output a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.length}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the object being passed to the `Error` constructor, which would cause the previous version to throw an error.

DONE.
