  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit()` would be called twice, which could cause issues if the domain is not re-entered correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter();
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.enter()` would be called twice, which could cause issues if the domain is not exited correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit();
domain.enter();
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit()` and `domain.enter()` would be called twice, which could cause issues if the domain is not re-entered correctly.

DONE.
