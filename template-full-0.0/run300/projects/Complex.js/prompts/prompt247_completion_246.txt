  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the negative of the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the sign of the resulting complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the resulting complex number.

DONE.
