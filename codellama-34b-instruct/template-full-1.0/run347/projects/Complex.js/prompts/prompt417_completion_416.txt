  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the complex number is zero, while the mutated code is checking if the complex number is infinite, which could lead to different results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(this['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the complex number is zero, while the mutated code is checking if the complex number is not infinite, which could lead to different results in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the complex number is zero, while the mutated code is checking if the complex number is NaN (Not a Number), which could lead to different results in some cases.

DONE.
