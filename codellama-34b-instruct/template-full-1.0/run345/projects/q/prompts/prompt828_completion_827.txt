  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is used to handle errors in the promise chain, and setting it to `null` would prevent any error handling from occurring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (error) {
    throw new Error("Whoops!");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is used to handle errors in the promise chain, and replacing it with a function that throws a new error would result in a different error being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (error) {
    console.log(error.stack);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is used to handle errors in the promise chain, and replacing it with a function that logs the error stack would result in the error being logged in a different way than the original code would have
