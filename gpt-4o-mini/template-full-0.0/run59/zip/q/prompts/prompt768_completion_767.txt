Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, function() { throw new Error("Promise rejected"); }, noop
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the promise to always reject, regardless of its actual state, which would lead to the `allResolved` function rejecting immediately instead of waiting for all promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Forced rejection")), noop, noop
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately rejects the promise with a new error, causing the `allResolved` function to return a rejected promise even if some of the original promises were fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve("Unexpected value"), noop, noop
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with a fixed value ("Unexpected value"), which would not reflect the actual state of the original promises, potentially leading to incorrect results in the final output of the `allResolved` function.

DONE.
