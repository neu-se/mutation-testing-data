  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that raises an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` is a statement that returns a value from a function, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of a value, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

DONE.
