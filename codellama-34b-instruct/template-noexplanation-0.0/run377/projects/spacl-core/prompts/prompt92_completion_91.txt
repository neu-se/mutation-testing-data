  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice(1))
```
This code fragment will skip the first policy in the `policies` array, which may cause the `push` method to not add all the policies to the `PolicyMap`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.filter(p => p.name !== 'default'))
```
This code fragment will filter out any policies with the name 'default' from the `policies` array, which may cause the `push` method to not add all the policies to the `PolicyMap`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.reverse())
```
This code fragment will iterate over the `policies` array in reverse order, which may cause the `push` method to not add all the policies to the `PolicyMap` in the correct order.

DONE.
