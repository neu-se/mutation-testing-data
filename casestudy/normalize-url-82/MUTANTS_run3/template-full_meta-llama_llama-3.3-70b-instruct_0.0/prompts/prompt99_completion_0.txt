Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.removeTrailingSlash && urlObj.pathname !== '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to only remove the trailing slash when `removeTrailingSlash` is true and the pathname is not the root directory, which is the opposite of the original condition when the pathname is the root directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.pathname === '/' || options.removeTrailingSlash
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operator precedence and the condition to remove the trailing slash when the pathname is the root directory or `removeTrailingSlash` is true, which could lead to incorrect removal of the trailing slash in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.removeTrailingSlash && urlObj.searchParams.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to remove the trailing slash when `removeTrailingSlash` is true and there are no search parameters, which is unrelated to the original condition that checks the pathname and hash.

DONE.
