  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key + 1)}
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be looking at the value of the key that comes after the current key instead of the current key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key)}
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be looking at the value of the key that comes before the current key instead of the current key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key)}
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be looking at the value of the key that is a property of the key instead of the current key.

DONE.
