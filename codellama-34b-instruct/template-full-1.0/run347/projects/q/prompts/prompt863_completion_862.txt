  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method is designed to delay a promise by a certain amount of time. Using the constant `0` instead of the `timeout` would result in the promise being resolved immediately, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method is designed to delay a promise by a certain amount of time. Using the constant `null` instead of the `timeout` would result in the promise being resolved immediately, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method is designed to delay a promise by a certain amount of time. Using the constant `Infinity` instead of the `timeout` would result in the promise never being resolved, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
