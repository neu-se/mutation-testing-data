  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the URL path, while the new code uses a backslash, which is not a valid URL path separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the URL path, while the new code uses a hash symbol, which is not a valid URL path separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the URL path, while the new code uses a question mark, which is not a valid URL path separator.

DONE.
