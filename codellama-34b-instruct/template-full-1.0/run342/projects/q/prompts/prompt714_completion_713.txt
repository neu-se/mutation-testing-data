  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would always return a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that can return a fulfilled or rejected promise depending on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` returns a new deferred object, whereas `Q` is a function that can return a fulfilled or rejected promise depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.negate
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.negate` negates the result of a promise, whereas `Q` is a function that can return a fulfilled or rejected promise depending on the input.

DONE.
