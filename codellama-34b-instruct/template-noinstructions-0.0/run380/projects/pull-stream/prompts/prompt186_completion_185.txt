  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `cb` with the value `true` when `i >= array.length`, while this new code fragment calls `cb` with the value `array[i++]` regardless of the value of `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `cb` with the value `true` when `i >= array.length`, while this new code fragment calls `cb` with the value `array[i--]` regardless of the value of `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
