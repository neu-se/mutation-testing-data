  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, generate()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the first argument to the `cb` function, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, generate()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to the `cb` function, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate(), null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `generate()` function would be called and its return value would be passed as the first argument to the `cb` function, which would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
