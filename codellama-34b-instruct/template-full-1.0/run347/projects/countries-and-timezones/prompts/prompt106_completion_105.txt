  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.id` might not be defined, even if `country` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.id` might not be `undefined`, even if `country` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.keys(country).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(country).length` might not be `0`, even if `country` is defined.

DONE.
