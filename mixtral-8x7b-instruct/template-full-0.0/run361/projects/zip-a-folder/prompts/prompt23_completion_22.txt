 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new archiver.Archiver('zip', archiverOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the archive format to 'zip', which may not match the desired format based on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
archiver.create('tar', archiverOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a 'tar' archive instead of the desired format based on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new archiver.create('7z', archiverOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to create a '7z' archive, which is not supported by the original code, and will throw an error.

DONE.
