  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an instance of `Promise`, so `request(options)` would fail if `Promise.reject` is passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a valid URL, so `new URL(options.url)` would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an arrow function would be passed as an argument to `request(options)`, which would not have the same behavior as `Promise.reject`.

DONE.
