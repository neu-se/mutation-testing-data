  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(noOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would mean that the promise chain is not being passed forward, and the rest of the chain could potentially be bypassed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).progress(noOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would mean that the progress event is not being forwarded to the rest of the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fail(noOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would mean that the failure event is not being forwarded to the rest of the promise chain.

DONE.
