  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `dest` is a string, and adding `'foo'` to it would result in a new string with the value `'destfoo'`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `dest` is a string, and calling `substring(1)` on it would return a new string with the value `'est'`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `dest` is a string, and calling `toUpperCase()` on it would return a new string with the value `'DEST'`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
