  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first character of the `path` string, rather than the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the `path` string, rather than the string itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `path` string in lowercase, rather than the original case.

DONE.
