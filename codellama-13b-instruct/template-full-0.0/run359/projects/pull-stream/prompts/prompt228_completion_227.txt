  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filterNot` function would now return a filtered array based on the length of the `data` array, rather than the original code fragment which simply returned the `data` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filterNot` function would now return a filtered array based on the first element of the `data` array, rather than the original code fragment which simply returned the `data` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.filter(function(x) { return x > 0 })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filterNot` function would now return a filtered array based on the result of the `filter` function, which would return an array of all elements in `data` that are greater than 0, rather than the original code fragment which simply returned the `data` array.

DONE.
