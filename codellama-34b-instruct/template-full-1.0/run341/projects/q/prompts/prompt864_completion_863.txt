  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function always returns `undefined`, so the `then` method would never be called, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsey value, so the `then` method would never be called, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function always returns `undefined`, so the `then` method would never be called, even if the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
