 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always calculate the bearing as 90 degrees (north) regardless of the input points, due to the sine of π/2 being 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always calculate the bearing as 0 degrees (east) regardless of the input points, due to the sine of 0 being 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the first point instead of the difference between the longitudes, causing incorrect bearing calculations.

DONE.
