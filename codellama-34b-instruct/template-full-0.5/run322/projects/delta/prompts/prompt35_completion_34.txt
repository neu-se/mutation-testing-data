  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` being undefined would cause the function to return `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would check if `b` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` being not null would cause the function to return `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would check if `b` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b` being not undefined would cause the function to return `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would check if `b` is not an object.

DONE.
