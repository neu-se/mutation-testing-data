  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a resolved URL string, while `URL.parse` returns an object containing properties for the URL's components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string, while `URL.parse` returns an object containing properties for the URL's components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolveObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolveObject` returns an object containing properties for the URL's components, while `URL.parse` returns an object containing properties for the URL's components.

DONE.
