  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) - Math.exp(-x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `cosh` function, which is defined as `Math.abs(x) < 1e-9 ? 1 - x : (Math.exp(x) + Math.exp(-x)) * 0.5`. The `cosh` function is used to compute the hyperbolic cosine of a number, and it is defined in terms of the `exp` function, which computes the exponential function. The `exp` function is defined as `Math.exp(x) = e^x`, where `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) + Math.exp(-x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `cosh` function, which is defined as `Math.abs(x) < 1e-9 ? 1 - x : (Math.
