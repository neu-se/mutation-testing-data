  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the loop iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an out-of-range error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the loop never run, as the condition is initially false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the loop always run at least once, even if the array is empty.

DONE.
