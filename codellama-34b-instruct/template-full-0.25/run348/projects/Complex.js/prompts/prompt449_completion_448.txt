  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the complex number by the number of places, instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the number of places to the imaginary part of the complex number, instead of multiplying it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * (places + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the imaginary part of the complex number by the number of places plus one, instead of just the number of places.

DONE.
