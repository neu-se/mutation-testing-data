  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would not be used, and the `basis` argument would be passed as the `this` value for the `callback` function, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would be used with the `basis` argument as the `this` value, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(basis, [this[index], index])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would be used with the `basis` argument as the `this` value, and the `this[index]` and `index` arguments would be passed as an array, which could cause the function to behave differently.
