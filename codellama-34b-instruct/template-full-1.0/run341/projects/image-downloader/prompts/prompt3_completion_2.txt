  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because it is missing the `url` property in the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is invalid')
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new TypeError('The options.url is not a string')
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a `TypeError` instead of an `Error`.

DONE.
