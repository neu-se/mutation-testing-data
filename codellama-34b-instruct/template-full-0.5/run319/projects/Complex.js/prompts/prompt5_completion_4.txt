  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` and `cos` are different mathematical functions, and replacing one with the other would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` and `sin` are different mathematical functions, and replacing one with the other would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` and `tan` are different mathematical functions, and replacing one with the other would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
