  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL.parse() method would not remove the fragment identifier from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL.parse() method would not return a URL object if the second argument (which is the base URL) is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL.parse() method would not return a URL object if the second argument (which is the base URL) is an empty string.

DONE.
