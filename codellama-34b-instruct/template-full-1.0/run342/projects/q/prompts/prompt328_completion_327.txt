  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fulfill, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be passing the `promise.fulfill` method instead of the `promise` object, which could lead to errors in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, "‌uncaught", [op]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncaught` event would be triggered instead of the `when` event, and the `promise` object would not be passed as an argument to the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, "‌fulfilled", [value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be passing the `promise` object as an argument with the `fulfilled` value instead of the `rejected` value, which could lead to errors in the promise chain.

DONE.
