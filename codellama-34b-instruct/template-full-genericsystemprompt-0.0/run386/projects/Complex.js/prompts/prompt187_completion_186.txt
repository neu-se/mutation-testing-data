  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the real part of the complex number before returning it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of just the real part.

DONE.
