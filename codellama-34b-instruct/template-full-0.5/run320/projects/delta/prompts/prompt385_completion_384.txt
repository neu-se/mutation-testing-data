  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, whereas `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation. Using `peekType()` instead of `peekLength()` would cause the code to behave differently when the next operation is a retain operation, as it would return the length of the operation instead of the type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` advances the iterator to the next operation and returns the operation, whereas `peekLength()` only returns the length of the next operation without advancing the iterator. Using `next()` instead of `peekLength()` would cause the code to behave differently when the next operation is a retain operation, as it would return the operation instead of the length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
