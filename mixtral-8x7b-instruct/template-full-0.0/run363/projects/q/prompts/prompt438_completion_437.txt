 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` method expects a single argument, but it is now called with an empty array, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` expects an array as its first argument, but it is now called with `null`, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a new array, so changes to the `unhandledRejections` array would not affect the returned array. This could lead to inconsistencies in the tracking of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
