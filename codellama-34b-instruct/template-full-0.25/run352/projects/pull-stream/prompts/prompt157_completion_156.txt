  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with no arguments, while the new code fragment `_value` calls the callback function with a single argument `_value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with no arguments, while the new code fragment `null` calls the callback function with a single argument `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with no arguments, while the new code fragment `undefined` calls the callback function with a single argument `undefined`.

DONE.
