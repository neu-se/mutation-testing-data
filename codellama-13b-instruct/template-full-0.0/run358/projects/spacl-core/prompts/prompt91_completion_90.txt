  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map((policy) => [policy.name, policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new array with the same elements as the `policies` array, while the modified code fragment returns a new array with the same elements as the `policies` array, but with the `name` property of each policy object set to the corresponding policy object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter((policy) => policy.name === 'admin')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new array with all the elements of the `policies` array, while the modified code fragment returns a new array with only the elements of the `policies` array that have a `name` property of `'admin'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.reduce((acc, policy) => acc.concat(policy.name), [])
```
