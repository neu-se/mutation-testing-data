  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a rejected promise, rather than a fulfilled one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method with an empty array of arguments, rather than the original array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method with a different value for the `value` parameter, which would cause the `set` method to be called with a different value than the original.

DONE.
