  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a constant, while the modified code fragment `a + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a constant, while the modified code fragment `b` is a variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a constant, while the modified code fragment `a * b` is an expression that multiplies the constant by the variable `b`.

DONE.
