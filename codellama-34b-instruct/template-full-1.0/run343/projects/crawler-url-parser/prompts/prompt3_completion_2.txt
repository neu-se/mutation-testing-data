  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof currentUrlStr == 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `currentUrlStr` is undefined, but this new fragment checks whether it's null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof currentUrlStr === 'boolean'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `currentUrlStr` is undefined, but this new fragment checks whether it's a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr == 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `currentUrlStr` is undefined, but this new fragment checks whether it's a string value 'null'.

DONE.
