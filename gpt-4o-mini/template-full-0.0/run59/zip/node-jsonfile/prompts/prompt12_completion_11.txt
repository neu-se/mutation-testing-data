Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.encoding : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the property being accessed from `reviver` to `encoding`, which is not intended for JSON parsing and could lead to incorrect parsing or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the reviver function entirely, which means that the JSON parsing will not have any custom transformation logic applied, potentially leading to different results than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the reviver function with an empty function, which means that the JSON parsing will not modify the parsed object at all, leading to a loss of intended transformations.

DONE.
