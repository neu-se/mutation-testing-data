  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `aborted`, so if `aborted` is `true`, the code would enter the `if` block, but if `aborted` is `false`, the code would not enter the `if` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` checks for strict inequality, so if `aborted` is not strictly equal to `true`, the code would enter the `if` block, but if `aborted` is strictly equal to `true`, the code would not enter the `if` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` checks for strict inequality, so if `aborted` is not strictly equal to `false`, the code would enter the `if` block, but if `aborted
