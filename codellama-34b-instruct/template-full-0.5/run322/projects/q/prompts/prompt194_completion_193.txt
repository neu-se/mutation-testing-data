  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Number` function to be called on a string, which would return `NaN` instead of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Number` function to be called on the result of an addition operation, which would return `2` instead of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Number` function to be called on a random number, which would return a different number each time it is called.

DONE.
