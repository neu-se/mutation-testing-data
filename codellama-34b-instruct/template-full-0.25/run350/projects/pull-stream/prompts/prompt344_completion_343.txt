  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function and `onAbort()` would call that function, whereas `onAbort` by itself would simply refer to the function without calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.call(this)` would call the `onAbort` function with `this` as the context, whereas `onAbort` by itself would simply refer to the function without calling it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.bind(this)` would create a new function that, when called, would call `onAbort` with `this` as the context, whereas `onAbort` by itself would simply refer to the function without calling it.

DONE.
