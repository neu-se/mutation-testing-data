 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
60 * Math.floor(min / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds the minutes to the nearest hour instead of keeping it as a minute value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the minute value to a string, which would then be concatenated with the sign instead of being used in arithmetic operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the minute value with a random number, which would result in an incorrect offset string.

DONE.
