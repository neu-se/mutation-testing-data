  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.call(null)` would call the `callback` function with a `this` value of `null`, whereas the original code would call it with a `this` value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply(null)` would call the `callback` function with a `this` value of `null` and an empty arguments list, whereas the original code would call it with a `this` value of `promise` and an arguments list containing the value of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.bind(null)()` would call the `callback` function with a `this` value of `null` and an empty arguments list, whereas the original code would call it with a
