  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the function that is called when a match is found also has a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is the same, but the function that is called when a match is found has a different implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i,
