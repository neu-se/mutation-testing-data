  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `parsedUrl.pathname`, which returns the path of the URL without the query string or fragment, while `parsedUrl.path` returns the entire path including the query string and fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `parsedUrl.search` to get the query string of the URL, while `parsedUrl.path` returns the entire path including the query string and fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.hash
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `parsedUrl.hash` to get the fragment of the URL, while `parsedUrl.path` returns the entire path including the query string and fragment.

DONE.
