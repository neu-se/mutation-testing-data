  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last line of the stack trace instead of adding a new line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first line of the stack trace instead of adding a new line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new line to the beginning of the stack trace instead of the end.

DONE.
