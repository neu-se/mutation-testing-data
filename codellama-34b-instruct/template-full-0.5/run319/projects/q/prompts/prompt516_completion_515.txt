  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that is called when a promise is rejected, whereas `then` is a method that is called when a promise is fulfilled. Using `catch` in this context would cause the code to handle rejections differently than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that is called when a promise is either fulfilled or rejected, whereas `then` is only called when a promise is fulfilled. Using `finally` in this context would cause the code to handle rejections differently than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.always
```
This would result in different behavior because `always` is a method that is called when a promise is either fulfilled or rejected, whereas `then` is only called when a promise is fulfilled. Using `always` in this
