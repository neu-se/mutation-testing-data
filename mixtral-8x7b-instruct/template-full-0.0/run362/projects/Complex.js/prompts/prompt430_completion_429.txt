 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds down instead of up, which can change the result for some input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds to the nearest integer, which can change the result for some input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the real part by the places value instead of dividing, which can change the result for some input values.

DONE.
