  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the `read` variable, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the `read` variable, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the `read` variable, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
