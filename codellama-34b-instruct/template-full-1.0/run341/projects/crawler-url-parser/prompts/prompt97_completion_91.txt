  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
currentUrl.url && currentUrl.url.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.length` property is added, which would make the expression evaluate to `false` if `currentUrl.url` is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
currentUrl.url && typeof currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof currentUrl.url` would return a string, which would make the expression evaluate to `false` if `currentUrl.url` is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
currentUrl.url != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `currentUrl.url` is not undefined, which is different from the original code fragment where it would evaluate to `true` if `currentUrl` is truthy.

DONE.
