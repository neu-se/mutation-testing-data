  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.prototype.toString.call(point) === '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.prototype.toString` method checks the internal `[[Class]]` property of an object, which may not necessarily be the same as the `constructor` property used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.constructor !== Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of an object may not necessarily be the same as the `Object` constructor used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof point !== 'object' || !(point instanceof Object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks the object's prototype chain, which may not be the same as the `Object.prototype` used in the original code.

DONE.
