  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` variable is not declared, so the code would throw a reference error and the program would not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the key that was being referenced would now be different, which could cause the program to fail or behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be used as the key, which would cause the program to fail or behave incorrectly.

DONE.
