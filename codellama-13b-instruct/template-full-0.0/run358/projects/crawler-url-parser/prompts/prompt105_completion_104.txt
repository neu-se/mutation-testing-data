  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would capitalize the text, whereas the original code fragment would not modify the text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would lowercase the text, whereas the original code fragment would not modify the text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method would remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the text, whereas the original code fragment would not modify the text.

DONE.
