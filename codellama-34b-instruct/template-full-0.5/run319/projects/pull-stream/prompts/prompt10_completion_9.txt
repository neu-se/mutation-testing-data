  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is a function with a length of 1, while this new code checks if `a` is a function with a length greater than 1. This could cause the function to behave differently if `a` is a function with a length greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is a function with a length of 1, while this new code checks if `a` is a function with a length of 0. This could cause the function to behave differently if `a` is a function with a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior
