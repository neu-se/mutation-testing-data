  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, which may not be the desired outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, which may not be the desired outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, which may not be the desired outcome.

DONE.
