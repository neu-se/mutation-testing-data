  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.isEmpty()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.isEmpty()` checks if the line is empty, while `line.length() > 0` checks if the line has a length greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.length === 0` checks if the length of the line is equal to 0, while `line.length() > 0` checks if the length is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!line.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!line.length()` checks if the length of the line is 0, while `line.length() > 0` checks if the length is greater than 0.

DONE.
