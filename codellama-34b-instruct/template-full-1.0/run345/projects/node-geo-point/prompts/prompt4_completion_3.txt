  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
    typeof point === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string, so this expression would always evaluate to `false` when `point` is a non-null object, even if it's not a plain object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
    point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks whether a property exists in the object, not whether it's a plain object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
    point instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks whether an object is an instance of a particular class, not whether it's a plain object.

DONE.
