  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ves' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append an extra "s" to the word, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ves' + w.substr(0, w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append an extra "s" to the word and also remove the last character of the word, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ves' + w.substr(0, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append an extra "s" to the word and also remove the last two characters of the word, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
