  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the task to undefined, which would cause the loop to terminate early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the task to null, which would cause the loop to terminate early.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the task to an empty function, which would cause the loop to terminate early.

DONE.
