  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the attributes of the next operation in the iterator, while the modified code fragment uses an empty attribute map. This could cause the `eachLine` method to behave differently when the predicate function is called.

DONE.
