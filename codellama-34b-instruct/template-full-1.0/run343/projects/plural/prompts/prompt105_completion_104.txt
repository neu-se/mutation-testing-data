  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|)\b/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment adds an "s" to the end of the matched words, but the original fragment did not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|goose)\b/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
