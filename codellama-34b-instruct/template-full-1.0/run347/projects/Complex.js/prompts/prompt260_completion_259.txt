  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only computes the product of `a` and `b`, while this modification computes the product of `a` and `b` squared.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only computes the product of `a` and `b`, while this modification computes the product of `b` and `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['re'] + this['im']) * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only computes the product of `a` and `b`, while this modification computes the product of `a + b` and `b`.

DONE.
