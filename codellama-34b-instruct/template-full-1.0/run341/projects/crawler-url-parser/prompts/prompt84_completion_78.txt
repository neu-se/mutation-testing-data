  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because when the URL is extracted from the <a> tag, the function would return null instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the URL without trimming the text, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the inner HTML of the <a> tag instead of the URL, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
