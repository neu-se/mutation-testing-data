  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the search for the newline character at the end of the string, rather than the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for the null character at the beginning of the string, rather than the newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for the undefined value at the beginning of the string, rather than the newline character.

DONE.
