  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejection` is a different variable than `promise`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason` is a different variable than `promise`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `promise`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

DONE.
