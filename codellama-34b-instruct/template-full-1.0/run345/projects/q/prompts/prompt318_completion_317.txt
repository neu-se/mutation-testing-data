  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the prototype property to the Object prototype object instead of the Promise prototype object, which could affect how methods and properties are accessed and inherited.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the prototype property to the Number prototype object instead of the Promise prototype object, which could affect how methods and properties are accessed and inherited.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the prototype property to the Function prototype object instead of the Promise prototype object, which could affect how methods and properties are accessed and inherited.

DONE.
