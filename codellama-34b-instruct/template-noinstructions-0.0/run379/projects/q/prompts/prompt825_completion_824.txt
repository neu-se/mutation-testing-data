  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value `promise`, while this modified code fragment would reject the promise with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value `promise`, while this modified code fragment would reject the promise with the reason "Something went wrong".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.resolve("Something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value `promise`, while this modified code fragment would resolve the promise with the value "Something went wrong".

DONE.
