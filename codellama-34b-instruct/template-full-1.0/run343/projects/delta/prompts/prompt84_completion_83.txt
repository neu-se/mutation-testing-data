  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is the negation of `isEqual`, and it will return `false` when the two values are equal, which is the opposite of the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for arrays with a length of 0 or less, even if the array contains non-empty values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter(function(value, index, array) {
  return value !== array[index - 1];
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out duplicate values in the array, whereas the original code would retain all values.

DONE.
