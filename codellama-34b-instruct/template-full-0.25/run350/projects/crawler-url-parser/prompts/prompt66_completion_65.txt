  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("=")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search string on "&" characters, while this new code fragment splits it on "=" characters. This could cause the code to misinterpret the search string and produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("&")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search string on "&" characters and then counts the number of resulting elements, while this new code fragment splits the search string on "&" characters, takes the first element, and then counts the number of characters in that element. This could cause the code to misinterpret the search string and produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("&").length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the
