  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason` and `promise` are different variables, and the `array_indexOf` function would return different values for each.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, unhandledReasons[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons[at]` is a different value than `promise`, and the `array_indexOf` function would return different values for each.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, unhandledReasons[atReport]
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons[atReport]` is a different value than `promise`, and the `array_indexOf` function would return different values for each.

DONE.
