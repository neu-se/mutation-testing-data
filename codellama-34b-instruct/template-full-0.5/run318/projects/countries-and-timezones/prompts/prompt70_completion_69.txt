  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeTimezone` is called with a null argument, which will cause the function to return without updating the `timezones` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone({});
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeTimezone` is called with an empty object as an argument, which will cause the function to update the `timezones` object with an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeTimezone` is called with a reference to the `timezones` object, which will cause the function to update the `timezones` object with a reference to itself.

DONE.
