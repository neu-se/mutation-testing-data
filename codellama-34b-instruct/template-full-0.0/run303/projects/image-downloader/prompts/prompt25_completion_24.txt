  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This would result in different behavior because `__filename` is the name of the current file, while `__dirname` is the name of the current directory. Using `__filename` instead of `__dirname` would cause the `path.resolve()` method to resolve the file name relative to the current file, rather than the current directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname()` returns the directory name of a path, while `__dirname` returns the name of the current directory. Using `path.dirname()` instead of `__dirname` would cause the `path.resolve()` method to resolve the file name relative to the directory of the destination file, rather than the current directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename()` returns the base name of a path, while `__dirname` returns
