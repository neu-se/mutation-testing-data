 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"POST"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison in the `Promise.prototype.invoke` function would fail, causing the function to not execute as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return "post"; }
