  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would behave differently than `undefined`, which is the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than the original `key`, and it would behave differently when calling the `set` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
foo, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `foo` is a different variable than the original `key`, and it would behave differently when calling the `set` method.

DONE.
