Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `otherIter` to consume only one element regardless of the actual length of the operation, potentially leading to incorrect transformations if the operation length is greater than one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation without consuming it, which means the same operation would be processed multiple times, leading to incorrect results in the transformation logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to consume zero elements, which is nonsensical and could lead to an infinite loop or unexpected behavior in the transformation process, as it would not advance the iterator.

DONE.
