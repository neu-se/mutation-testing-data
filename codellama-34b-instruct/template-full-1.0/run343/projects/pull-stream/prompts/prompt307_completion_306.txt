  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `data` to the callback, even if the test failed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `err` and `data` to the callback, even if the test failed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err || true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `err` or `true` to the callback, depending on whether an error occurred.

DONE.
