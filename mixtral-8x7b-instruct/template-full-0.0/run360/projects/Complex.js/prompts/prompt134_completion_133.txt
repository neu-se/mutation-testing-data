 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the 're' property of `z` with Infinity, instead of checking if `z` itself is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `z` object has an `isInfinite` method, instead of checking if the 're' and 'im' properties of `z` are both Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isInfinite(z['re']) && isInfinite(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both the 're' and 'im' properties of `z` are Infinity using the global `isInfinite` function, instead of checking if either property is Infinity.

DONE.
