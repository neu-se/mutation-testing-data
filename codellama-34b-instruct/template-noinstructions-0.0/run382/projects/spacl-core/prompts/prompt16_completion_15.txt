  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that ends with a slash, while the new code fragment matches any string that starts with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that ends with a slash, while the new code fragment matches any string that starts with a slash and ends with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that ends with a slash, while the new code fragment matches any string that starts with a slash and ends with a slash, and also requires the string to contain at least one character.

DONE.
