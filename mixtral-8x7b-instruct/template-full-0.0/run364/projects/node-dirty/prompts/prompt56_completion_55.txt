 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this.close = () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `close` method with an empty function, preventing the actual closing behavior from being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this._readStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately destroy the read stream, potentially causing issues if there's still data to be read.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this._queue.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the `_queue` map, causing any pending write operations to be lost and not persisted to the disk.

DONE.
