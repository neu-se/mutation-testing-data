  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeRejector
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` and `makeNodeRejector` are different functions that handle the resolution and rejection of promises, respectively. Using `makeNodeRejector` would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the original code fragment was intended to resolve the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a resolver function, while `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a resolver function, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a call to the resolver function, which would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, even if the original code fragment was intended to resolve the promise later.
