  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
item + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `item` is a single value, while `item + 1` is a new value that is one greater than `item`. This change would cause the `reduce` function to accumulate a different set of values than the original code.

DONE.
