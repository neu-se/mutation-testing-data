  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `end.tail` to a reference to the `end` object, creating a circular reference. In contrast, the new code fragment sets `end.tail` to `null`, breaking the circular reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = end.head;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `end.tail` to a reference to the `end` object, creating a circular reference. In contrast, the new code fragment sets `end.tail` to a reference to the `head` property of the `end` object, creating a different circular reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = {head: end.head, tail: null};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `end.tail` to a reference to the `end` object, creating a circular reference.
