  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `true` option, which means that the URL would not be parsed in a way that is consistent with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with a `null` value, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with an `undefined` value, which would cause an error.

DONE.
