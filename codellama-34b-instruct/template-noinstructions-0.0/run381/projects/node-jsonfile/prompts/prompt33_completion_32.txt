  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function, while `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)` is an asynchronous function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile.bind(fs))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(fs)` is a bound function, while `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)` is an unbound function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile.bind(null))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(null)` is a bound function with a null context, while `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)` is an unbound function.

DONE.
