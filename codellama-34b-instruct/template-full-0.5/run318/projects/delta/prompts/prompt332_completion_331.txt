  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the `op` and `baseOp` objects, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would transform the attributes of the `op` and `baseOp` objects using the `priority` flag, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.combine(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would combine the attributes of the `op` and `baseOp` objects, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
