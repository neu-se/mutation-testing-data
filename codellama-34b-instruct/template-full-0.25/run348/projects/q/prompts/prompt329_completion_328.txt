  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, while `throw exception` will throw an exception and stop the execution of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, while `return resolve(exception)` will return a resolved promise with the exception as the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, while `return reject(exception)` will return a rejected promise with the exception as the reason.

DONE.
