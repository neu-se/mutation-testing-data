  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first element in the slice, potentially causing the `forEach` loop to miss an iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first two elements in the slice, potentially causing the `forEach` loop to miss two iterations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 4
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first three elements in the slice, potentially causing the `forEach` loop to miss three iterations.

DONE.
