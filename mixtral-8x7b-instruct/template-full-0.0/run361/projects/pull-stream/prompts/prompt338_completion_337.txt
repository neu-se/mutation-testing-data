 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `this` context of the `field` function to the global object, which might not have the expected behavior if `field` relies on the `this` value to refer to the current data item.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the result of `field` to a string, which might not be the expected type if the `seen` object or the `filter` function expects a different type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(field || id)(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a potential short-circuit evaluation that might bypass the `field` function and always use the `id` function instead, which could lead to incorrect results if `field` has side effects or returns a different value than `id`.

DONE.
