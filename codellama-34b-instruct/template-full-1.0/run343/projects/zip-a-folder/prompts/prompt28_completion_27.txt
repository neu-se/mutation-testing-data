  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'error'` event is not being handled, and it will cause the promise to be rejected if it occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'end'` event is not being handled, and it will cause the promise to be resolved even if the archive is not complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'finish'` event is not being handled, and it will cause the promise to be resolved even if the archive is not complete.

DONE.
