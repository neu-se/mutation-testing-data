  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return a new array containing the elements of `arguments` from index 1 to the end, whereas `arguments` would return the original array of function arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return a new array containing the elements of `arguments` from index 2 to the end, whereas `arguments` would return the original array of function arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return a new array containing the elements of `arguments` from index 3 to the end, whereas `arguments` would return the original array of function arguments.

DONE.
