  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the number -1 as the callback function instead of the actual callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a null value as the callback function instead of the actual callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a new function object as the callback function instead of the actual callback function.

DONE.
