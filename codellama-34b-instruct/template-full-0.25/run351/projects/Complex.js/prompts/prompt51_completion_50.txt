  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` is the logical negation of `Number.isFinite`, which means that it will return `true` if the argument is not a finite number, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `Number.isFinite` is used to check if the argument is a finite number, and the code inside the `if` statement is executed if it is not. By replacing it with `!Number.isFinite`, the code inside the `if` statement will be executed if the argument is a finite number, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if the argument is `NaN`, which means "Not a Number". In the original code, `Number.isFinite` is used to check if the argument is a finite number. By replacing it with `Number.isNaN`, the
