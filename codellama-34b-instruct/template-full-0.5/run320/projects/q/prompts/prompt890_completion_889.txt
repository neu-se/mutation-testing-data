  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfcall` is a different method than `nfapply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `nbind` is a different method than `nfapply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).denodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because `denodeify` is a different method than `nfapply`.

DONE.
