 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat` is a built-in function that converts a string into a floating point number, while `isNaN` is a function that determines whether the passed value is `NaN` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` is a built-in function that returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range [0, 1) while `isNaN` is a function that determines whether the passed value is `NaN` or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.re` is a property of the current object that represents the real part of the complex number, while `isNaN` is a function that determines whether the passed value is `NaN` or not.

DONE.
