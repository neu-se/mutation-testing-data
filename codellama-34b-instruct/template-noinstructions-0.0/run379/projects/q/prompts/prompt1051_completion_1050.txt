  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `null` instead of a rejected promise, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return a rejected promise with a different error message, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return a resolved promise with the `end` object, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
