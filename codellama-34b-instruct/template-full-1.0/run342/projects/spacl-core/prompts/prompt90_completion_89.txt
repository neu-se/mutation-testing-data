  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Original code:
const policy

// Mutated code:
const policy2
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `policy2` is not defined, and the loop will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Original code:
const policy

// Mutated code:
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop body would change from mutating the `policy` object to attempting to access a non-existent property `name` of the `policy` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Original code:
const policy

// Mutated code:
this.policy
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop body would change from mutating the `policy` object to attempting to mutate the `policy` property of the `this` object, which is not defined in the original code.

DONE.
