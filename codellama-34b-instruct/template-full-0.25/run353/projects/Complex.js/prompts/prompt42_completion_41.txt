  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, while the new code fragment is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the addition of two squares, while the new code fragment is using the difference of two squares.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the addition of two squares, while the new code fragment is using the difference of two squares.

DONE.
