 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the next operation, potentially causing the `transform` method to skip or process too many characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
