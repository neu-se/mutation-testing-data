Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the `isObject` check to fail, leading to a `TypeError` being thrown, whereas the original code expects a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `coordinates` array instead of the entire `point` object to the `isObject` function, which would incorrectly evaluate to `true` and bypass the subsequent checks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ type: 'Point' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an object that has the required `type` property but lacks the `coordinates` property, causing the check for `coordinates` to fail and throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
