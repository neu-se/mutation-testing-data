  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is rejected instead of fulfilled, which could cause the promise to be treated as pending instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is pending instead of fulfilled, which could cause the promise to be treated as pending instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is not fulfilled instead of fulfilled, which could cause the promise to be treated as pending instead of fulfilled.

DONE.
