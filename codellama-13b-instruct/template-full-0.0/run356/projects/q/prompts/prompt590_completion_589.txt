  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a function reference. This could cause the code to behave differently, depending on the context in which it is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a function reference. This could cause the code to behave differently, depending on the context in which it is used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a function reference. This could cause the code to behave differently, depending on the context in which it is used.

DONE.
