  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would never enter the `if` block, as `1` is truthy and `!1` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always enter the `if` block, as `0` is falsy and `!0` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`undefined`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always enter the `if` block, as `undefined` is falsy and `!undefined` is truthy.

DONE.
