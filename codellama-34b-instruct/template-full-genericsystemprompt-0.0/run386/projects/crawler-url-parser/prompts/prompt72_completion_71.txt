  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` attribute of the `base` element, which may not exist or may have a different value than the `href` attribute of the `a` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href', 'https://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `href` attribute of the `base` element to `https://example.com`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href', function() { return 'https://example.com'; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `href` attribute of the `base` element to a function that returns `https://example.com`, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
