  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err) { last = false; cb(err); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `cb` with the error as an argument if `err` was truthy, whereas this new code fragment would always call `cb` with the error as an argument when `err` is not null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err) { last = false; cb(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `cb` with the error as an argument if `err` was truthy, whereas this new code fragment would always call `cb` without any arguments when `err` is not null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err) { last = false; cb(true); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `cb` with the error as an argument if `err` was truthy, whereas
