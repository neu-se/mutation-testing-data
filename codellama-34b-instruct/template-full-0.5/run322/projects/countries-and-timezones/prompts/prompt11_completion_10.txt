  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with a single property, rather than updating the existing object with a new property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: tz.r, all: [] } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `current` property to the value of `tz.r`, rather than the value of `id`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: tz.r, all: tz.a } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `all` property to the value of `tz.a`, rather than the value of `id`.

DONE.
