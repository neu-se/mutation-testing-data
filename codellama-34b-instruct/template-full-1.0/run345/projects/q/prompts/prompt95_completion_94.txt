  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would cause `index` to be incremented even if it is already greater than or equal to `length`, which could cause an infinite loop or other unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index ==> length
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would cause `index` to be incremented until it is greater than or equal to `length`, which could cause an infinite loop or other unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < length
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would only cause `index` to be incremented if it is already less than `length`, which could cause the loop to terminate early.

DONE.
