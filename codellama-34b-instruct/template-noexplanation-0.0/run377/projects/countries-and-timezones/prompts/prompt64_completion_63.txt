  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverCountry(countries[id], options);
```
This code fragment is a function call to the `deliverCountry` function, which is defined in the code snippet. The function takes two arguments: `countries[id]` and `options`. The `countries[id]` argument is an object that represents a country, and the `options` argument is an object that contains options for the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverCountry(timezones[name], options);
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous one, but it uses the `timezones` object instead of the `countries` object. The `timezones[name]` argument is an object that represents a timezone, and the `options` argument is an object that contains options for the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverCountry(countries[id], { deprecated: true });
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous two, but
