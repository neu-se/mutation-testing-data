  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses !== "undefined" && ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to true if `ses` is defined and its `ok` method returns true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses !== "undefined" || ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to true if `ses` is defined or if its `ok` method returns true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses !== "undefined" && ses.ok() && Math.random() > 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to true if `ses` is defined, its `ok` method returns true, and a random number is greater than 0.5.

DONE.
