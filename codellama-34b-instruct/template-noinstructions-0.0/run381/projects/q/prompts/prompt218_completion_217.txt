  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of fulfilled, which would cause the promise chain to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of the promise being fulfilled, which would cause the promise chain to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <anything other than a promise>
```
This would result in different behavior because a non-promise value would be returned instead of a promise, which would cause the promise chain to fail.

DONE.
