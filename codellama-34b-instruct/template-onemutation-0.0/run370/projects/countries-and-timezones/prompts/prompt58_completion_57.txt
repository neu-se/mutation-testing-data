  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeTimezone` is a different function than `memoizeCountry`, and it has a different purpose. `memoizeTimezone` is used to memoize the `timezones` object, while `memoizeCountry` is used to memoize the `countries` object.
