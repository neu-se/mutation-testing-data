  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would make it case-insensitive, allowing it to match URLs that start with `//` regardless of the case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would make it global, allowing it to match all occurrences of `//` in the URL, rather than just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression would make it multiline, allowing it to match `//` in URLs that span multiple lines.

DONE.
