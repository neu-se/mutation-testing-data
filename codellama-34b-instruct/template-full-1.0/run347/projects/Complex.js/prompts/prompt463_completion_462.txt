  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `Math.abs()` function is used to ensure that the value is positive, but this is not necessary when using the less than or equal to operator (`<=`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `Math.abs()` function is used to ensure that the value is positive, but in this code fragment, the value is not wrapped in the `Math.abs()` function, which could result in unexpected behavior if the value is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `Math.abs()` function is used to ensure that the value is positive, but this code fragment uses the not equal to operator (`!=`) to make a comparison,
