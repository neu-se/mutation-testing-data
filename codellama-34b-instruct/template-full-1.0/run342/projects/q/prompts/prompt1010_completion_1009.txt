  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is now treated as containing 2 elements instead of 1, which would cause the function to behave differently when called with a different number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs.length` property is not necessarily equivalent to the `arguments` object, especially if the function is called with a variable number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(2)` is a promise that resolves to the value `2`, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object containing the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
