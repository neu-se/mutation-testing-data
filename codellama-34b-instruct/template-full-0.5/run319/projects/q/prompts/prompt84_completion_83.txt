  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `requestTick` function to be called immediately, rather than being called asynchronously via `setTimeout`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(requestTick, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `requestTick` function to be called with a delay of 1000 milliseconds, rather than being called asynchronously via `setTimeout`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval(requestTick, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `requestTick` function to be called repeatedly every 0 milliseconds, rather than being called asynchronously via `setTimeout`.

DONE.
