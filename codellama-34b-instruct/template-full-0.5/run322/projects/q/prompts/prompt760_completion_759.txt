  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` will return a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `array_map` will return a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` will return a single value that is the result of combining the elements of the array using the provided function, whereas `array_map` will return a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reverse` will return a new array containing the elements of the original array in reverse order, whereas `array_map` will return a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array.
