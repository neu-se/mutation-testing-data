  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memories'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "memos" is a valid plural form of "memo," but "memories" is not a valid plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "memoes" is not a valid plural form of "memo."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "memo" is not a valid plural form of "memo."

DONE.
