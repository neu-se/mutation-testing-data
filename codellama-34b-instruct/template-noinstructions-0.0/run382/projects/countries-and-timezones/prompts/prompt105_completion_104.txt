  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key].deprecated }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include deprecated timezones in the returned object, whereas the original code fragment would include all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key].timezones }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the timezones property of each timezone object in the returned object, whereas the original code fragment would include all properties of each timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key].countries }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the countries property of each timezone object in the returned object, whereas the original code fragment would include all properties of each timezone object.

DONE.
