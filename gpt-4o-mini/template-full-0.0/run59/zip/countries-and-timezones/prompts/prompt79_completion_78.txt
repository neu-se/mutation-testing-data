Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the input to the `getTimezone` function by converting `tzName` to uppercase, which may not match the keys in the `timezones` object, potentially leading to a failure to retrieve the correct timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName + 'Invalid')
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'Invalid' to `tzName`, which will likely not correspond to any valid timezone, resulting in `null` being returned instead of the expected timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName.split('-')[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies `tzName` by taking only the first part of a hyphen-separated string, which may lead to retrieving a different timezone than intended if `tzName` was expected to be a full identifier.

DONE.
