  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 0 instead of 1, which could cause the first argument to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time than the original code, which could cause an error if the function is not designed to handle extra arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time than the original code, which could cause the last argument to be skipped.

DONE.
