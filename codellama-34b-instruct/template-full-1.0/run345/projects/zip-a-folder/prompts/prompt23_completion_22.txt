  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver(format, { gzip: true, gzipOptions: { level: 0 } });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a tarball with no compression, regardless of the value of the `compression` property in `zipAFolderOptions`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver(format, { zlib: { level: 0 } });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a tarball with no compression, regardless of the value of the `compression` property in `zipAFolderOptions`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver(format, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a tarball with the default configuration, which includes compression.

DONE.
