  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1 === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because a `Promise` object would never be equal to the number `2`, even if the promise is resolved with the value `2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` is not a standard JavaScript function, and it would cause the mutation test to fail due to a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Promise]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would correctly identify the object as a `Promise`, but it would not check if the promise is resolved or rejected, and it would not allow for any other form of queries on the promise.

DONE.
