 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` always rounds down to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` always rounds up to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a => Math.round(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an arrow function to define a custom rounding function, which may not behave the same as `Math.round` for certain input values.

DONE.
