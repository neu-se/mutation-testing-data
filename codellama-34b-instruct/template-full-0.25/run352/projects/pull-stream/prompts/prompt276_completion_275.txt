  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` would be called twice, once in the `else` block and once in the `nextStream()` function itself, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with `true` as the first argument, which would cause the `read` function to return an error, rather than the expected `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function (err, data) {
