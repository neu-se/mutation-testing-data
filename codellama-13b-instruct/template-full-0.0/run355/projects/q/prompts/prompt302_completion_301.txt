  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would now return a rejection if the two promises resolve to different values, rather than returning the first promise that resolves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x == y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would now return the first promise that resolves, rather than returning a rejection if the two promises resolve to different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x === y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would now return a rejection if the two promises resolve to different values, rather than returning the first promise that resolves.

DONE.
