  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `_read` variable to `null`, causing the `nextChunk` function to be called again, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `_read` variable to `undefined`, causing the `nextChunk` function to be called again, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `_read` variable to `NaN`, causing the `nextChunk` function to be called again, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
