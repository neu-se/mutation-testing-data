  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('This is a different error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the code that handles errors to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new TypeError('This is a different error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error type would be different, which could cause the code that handles errors to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('This is a different error message', { cause: new Error('This is the original error message') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would have a different cause, which could affect how the code that handles errors behaves.

DONE.
