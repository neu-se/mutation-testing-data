  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise).then(function (fulfilledValue) {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.then()` method would be called on the resolved value of the `Q.when()` promise, instead of on the `promise` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function (fulfilledValue) {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q()` function would be called on the `promise` object, which would create a new promise that resolves to the resolved value of the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall(promise).then(function (fulfilledValue) {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fcall()` function would be called on the `promise` object, which would create a new promise that fulfills with the `promise` object itself.

DONE
