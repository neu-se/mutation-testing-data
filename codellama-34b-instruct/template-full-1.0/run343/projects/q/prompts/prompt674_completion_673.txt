  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a different value than `this.dispatch`, and it would change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `this.dispatch`, and it would change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `this.dispatch`, and it would change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
