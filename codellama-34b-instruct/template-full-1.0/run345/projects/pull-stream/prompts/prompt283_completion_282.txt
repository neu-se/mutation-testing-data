  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, while the new code fragment `cb()` is a function call with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(end, data)` is a function call with two arguments, `end` and `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, while the new code fragment `b(end, data)` is a function call with two arguments, `end` and `data`. However, the function `b` is not defined in the code snippet, so this change would result in a syntax error.

DONE.
