  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "GET";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `verb` variable to "GET", regardless of the actual verb being used in the request.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "POST";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `verb` variable to "POST", regardless of the actual verb being used in the request.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "PUT";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `verb` variable to "PUT", regardless of the actual verb being used in the request.

DONE.
