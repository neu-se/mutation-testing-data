  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because with the original code, if `a` is 0, the `if` statement would be executed, but with the modified code, if `a` is 0, the `if` statement would be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because with the original code, if `b` is 0 or less, the `if` statement would be executed, but with the modified code, if `b` is greater than 0, the `if` statement would be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because with the original code, if `a` is 0 or less or `b` is 0 or less, the `if` statement would be executed, but with the modified code, if `a` is greater than 0 and
