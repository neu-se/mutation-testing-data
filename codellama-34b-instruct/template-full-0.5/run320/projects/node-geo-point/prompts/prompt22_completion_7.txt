  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is called on the `object` itself, which would return `false` if the `latitude` property is inherited from the prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is called on the `Object.prototype` object, which would return `true` if the `latitude` property is inherited from the prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is called on the `object` itself, which would return `false` if the `longitude` property is inherited from the prototype chain.
