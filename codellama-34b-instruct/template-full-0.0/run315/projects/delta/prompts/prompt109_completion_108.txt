  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => !op
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the result of the `predicate` function, while this new code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the `op` object itself. This would cause the `filter` method to return a different set of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `predicate` function to determine whether an operation should be included in the filtered set, while this new code fragment uses the `attributes` property of the `op` object to determine whether an operation should be included. This would cause the `filter` method to return a different set of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `predicate` function to determine whether an
