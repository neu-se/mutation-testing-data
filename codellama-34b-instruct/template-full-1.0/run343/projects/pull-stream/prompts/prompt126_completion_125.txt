  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- i > max
+ i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would be inclusive instead of exclusive. The original code would return `true` only if `i` was greater than `max`, but the modified code would return `true` if `i` was greater than or equal to `max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- i > max
+ max < i
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would be reversed. The original code would return `true` only if `i` was greater than `max`, but the modified code would return `true` if `max` was less than `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- i > max
+ i == max
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would be changed from greater than to equal to. The original code would return `true` only if `i` was greater than `max`, but the modified code
