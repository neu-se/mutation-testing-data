  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with 
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function's argument count from 0 to 1, causing the code to behave differently in terms of argument handling and resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
1, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of the function's arguments, causing the code to behave differently in terms of argument handling and resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
...arguments, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function's argument collection strategy, causing the code to behave differently in terms of argument handling and resolution.

DONE.
