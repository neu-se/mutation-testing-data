  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"newName"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `npost` method to refer to a different property name than the one intended by the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `npost` method to refer to a null value, which would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `npost` method to refer to an undefined value, which would likely result in an error.

DONE.
