  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `data`, and it would cause the returned function to always return `null` instead of the actual data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `data`, and it would cause the returned function to always return `undefined` instead of the actual data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, {name: 'John', age: 30}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned function to always return an object with the properties `name` and `age`, instead of the actual data.

DONE.
