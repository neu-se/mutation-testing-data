  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a no-op, while the replacement code fragment adds 1 to the value of x.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a no-op, while the replacement code fragment subtracts 1 from the value of x.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a no-op, while the replacement code fragment multiplies the value of x by 2.

DONE.
