  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of an 'insert' operation, while this replacement checks for the absence of an 'insert' operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of an 'insert' operation, while this replacement checks for the absence of an 'insert' operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of an 'insert' operation, while this replacement checks for the presence of a 'delete' operation.

DONE.
