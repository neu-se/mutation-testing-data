  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw Error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply logs the error, while this new fragment will throw an error and potentially cause the program to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn('Error occurred. Dirty database found.')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the error as an error, while this new fragment logs it as a warning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exitCode = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not terminate the program, while this new fragment will terminate the program with a non-zero exit code.

DONE.
