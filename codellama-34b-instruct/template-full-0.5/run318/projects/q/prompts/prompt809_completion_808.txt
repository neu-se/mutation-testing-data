  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.apply === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `callback` is falsy or if `callback.apply` is not a function, while this replacement checks if `callback` is truthy and if `callback.apply` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && callback.apply !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `callback.apply` is not a function, while this replacement checks if `callback` is truthy and `callback.apply` is not a string "function".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.apply !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `callback.apply` is not a function, while this replacement checks if `callback` is truthy and `callback.apply` is not a function.

DONE.
