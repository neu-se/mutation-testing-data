  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of `b` to calculate `cosh(b)`, while the replaced code would cause the function to return `cosh(0)` instead, which would result in a different output for values of `a` and `b` that are not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of `b` to calculate `cosh(b)`, while the replaced code would cause the function to return `cosh(-b)` instead, which would result in a different output for values of `a` and `b` that are not equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of `b` to calculate `cosh(b)`, while the replaced code would cause the function to return `cosh(a)` instead, which
