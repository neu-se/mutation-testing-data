  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but the replacement code fragment `abortCb(null, abort, onAbort)` is a function that takes three arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but the replacement code fragment `abortCb(abort, onAbort)` is a function that takes only one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(onAbort, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but the replacement code fragment `abortCb(onAbort, abort)` is a function that takes two arguments in a
