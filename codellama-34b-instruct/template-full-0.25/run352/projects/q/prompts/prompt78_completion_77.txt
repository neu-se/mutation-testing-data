  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a specified delay, so it would cause the `flush` function to be executed after 1 second, instead of immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval(flush, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is a function that schedules a function to be executed repeatedly, with a specified delay between each execution, so it would cause the `flush` function to be executed repeatedly every 1 second, instead of just once.

DONE.
