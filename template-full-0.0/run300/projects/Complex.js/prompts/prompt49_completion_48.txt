  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` is the negation of `Number.isFinite`, which means that it will return `true` if the argument is not a finite number, and `false` if it is a finite number. In the original code, `Number.isFinite` is used to check if the argument is a finite number, and if it is not, it returns `Complex.INFINITY`. By using `!Number.isFinite`, we are essentially checking if the argument is not a finite number, and if it is, we return `Complex.INFINITY`. This would cause the function to return `Complex.INFINITY` for any finite number, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a function that checks if the argument is NaN (Not a Number), and it returns `true
