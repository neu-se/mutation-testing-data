  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the wrong arguments. The `cb` function expects two arguments, `end` and `data`, but in this case, it is being called with `end` and `data` swapped. This would cause the function to behave differently and potentially cause errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with a `null` value for the `data` argument. This would cause the function to behave differently and potentially cause errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with a `null` value for the `end` argument. This would cause the function to behave differently and potentially cause errors.

DONE.
