  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement checks if it's a string. If `nextOp.retain` is a string, the original code would return `retain: length`, but the replacement would return `insert: nextOp.insert.substr(offset, length)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object' && nextOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement checks if it's an object that's not null. If `nextOp.retain` is an object that's not null, the original code would return `retain: length`, but the replacement would return `retain: nextOp.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
