 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `baseUrlStr` is not provided, the code will not add 'http://' as a prefix to `currentUrlStr` when it doesn't match the specific regex pattern, potentially causing incorrect URL parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` method's third argument is set to `false`, which means the parsed URL object will not include query strings. This could lead to unexpected behavior when processing URLs with query parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` method's second argument is set to `false`, which means the parsed URL object will not include the query string or fragment. This could lead to unexpected behavior when processing URLs with
