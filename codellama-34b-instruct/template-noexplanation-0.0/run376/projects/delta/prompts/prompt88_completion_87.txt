  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This change will cause the code to behave differently than the original code, as it will now check if the `insert` property of the `newOp` and `lastOp` objects are both numbers, rather than both strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'object' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'object'
```
This change will cause the code to behave differently than the original code, as it will now check if the `insert` property of the `newOp` and `lastOp` objects are both objects, rather than both strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'function' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'function'
```
This change will cause the code to behave differently than the original code, as it will now check if the `insert` property of the
