  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.post
```
This would result in different behavior because `request.post` is a different function than `request`, and it may not handle the request in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `request.get` is a different function than `request`, and it may not handle the request in the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.put
```
This would result in different behavior because `request.put` is a different function than `request`, and it may not handle the request in the same way.

DONE.
