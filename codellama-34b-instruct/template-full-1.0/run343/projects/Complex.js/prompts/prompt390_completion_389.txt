  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `a` alone, which would result in a different value for `d` and potentially a different result for the rest of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `a` and `b` separately, which would result in a different value for `d` and potentially a different result for the rest of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `a` and `b` combined, which would result in a different value for `d` and potentially a different result for the rest of the expression.

DONE.
