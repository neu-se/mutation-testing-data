  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops.filter(op => op.retain === 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code filters out ops with retain equal to 0, while this code filters out ops with retain equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops.filter(op => op.retain === 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code filters out ops with retain equal to 0, while this code filters out ops with retain equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops.filter(op => op.retain === 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code filters out ops with retain equal to 0, while this code filters out ops with retain equal to 2.

DONE.
