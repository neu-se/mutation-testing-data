  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isInfinite']()` would check if the complex number is infinite, whereas `this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)` would perform a different function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` would generate a random number, whereas `this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)` would perform a different function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['toPrecision'](5)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['toPrecision'](5)` would round the complex number to 5 decimal places, whereas `this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)` would perform a different function.

DONE.
