  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trousers
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `trouser`, which is a singular noun, while `trousers` is a plural noun.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pants
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `trouser`, which is a singular noun, while `pants` is a plural noun.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
panties
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `trouser`, which is a singular noun, while `panties` is a plural noun.

DONE.
