Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would immediately resolve the promise without waiting for the Node-style callback to be invoked, potentially leading to incorrect handling of asynchronous results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because using `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, regardless of the outcome of the Node-style function, which is not the intended behavior of appending a resolver.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this empty function does not provide a valid Node-style callback, leading to the promise never being resolved or rejected, effectively causing the operation to hang indefinitely.

DONE.
