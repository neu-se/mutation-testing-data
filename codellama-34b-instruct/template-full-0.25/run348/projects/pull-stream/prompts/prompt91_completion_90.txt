  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `test` function returns a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression if the first operand is falsy, so the `test` function would never be called if it returns a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression if the first operand is truthy, so the `test` function would never be called if it returns a truthy value.

DONE.
