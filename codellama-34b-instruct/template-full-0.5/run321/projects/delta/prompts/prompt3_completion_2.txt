  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a variable that is not defined in the scope of the `compose` function, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `a`, so the `reduce` method would not iterate over the same elements in the `attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `a`, so the `reduce` method would not iterate over the same elements in the `attributes` object.

DONE.
