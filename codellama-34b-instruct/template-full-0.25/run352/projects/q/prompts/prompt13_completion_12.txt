  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk()` is a function that always returns `false`, whereas `!ses.ok()` is a boolean negation of the `ses.ok()` function, which returns `true` if the current environment is a secure environment and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk() && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk() && true` is a boolean expression that always evaluates to `true`, whereas `!ses.ok()` is a boolean negation of the `ses.ok()` function, which returns `true` if the current environment is a secure environment and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk() || false
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk() || false` is a boolean expression that always evalu
