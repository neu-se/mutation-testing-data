  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the second element of the `tokens` array instead of the first, potentially missing the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error if the last element of the `tokens` array is accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = tokens.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, potentially causing different behavior in the `switch` statement that follows.

DONE.
