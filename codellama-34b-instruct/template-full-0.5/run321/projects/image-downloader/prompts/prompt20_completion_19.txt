  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isRelative` checks if the path is relative, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isFile` checks if the path points to a file, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isDirectory
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isDirectory` checks if the path points to a directory, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute.

DONE.
