Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an 'error' event instead of a 'load' event, which could lead to the application not properly signaling that the loading process has completed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load_complete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a non-existent event 'load_complete', which would not be handled elsewhere in the code, potentially leading to confusion or missed event handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'loaded'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'loaded' event instead of 'load', which may not be recognized by any listeners expecting the 'load' event, thus breaking the intended event-driven architecture.

DONE.
