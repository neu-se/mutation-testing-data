  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the imaginary part of the complex number, which is not necessarily zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the imaginary part of the complex number, which is not necessarily one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the imaginary part of the complex number, which is not necessarily negative one.

DONE.
