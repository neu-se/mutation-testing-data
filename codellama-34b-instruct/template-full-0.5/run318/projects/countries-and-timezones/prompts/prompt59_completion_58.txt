  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `true` would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a partial country object, which would affect the behavior of the `getCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `false` would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a full country object, which would affect the behavior of the `getCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `null` would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a null country object, which would affect the behavior of the `getCountry` function.

DONE.
