  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `Object.keys` array instead of the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.keys.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `Object` prototype's `keys` property instead of the `Object.keys` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getKeys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getKeys` is a non-existent method and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
