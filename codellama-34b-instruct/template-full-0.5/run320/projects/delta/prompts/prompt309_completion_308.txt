  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert(0, 'PLACEHOLDER');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the string 'PLACEHOLDER' at the beginning of the line, rather than at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert(line.length, 'PLACEHOLDER');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the string 'PLACEHOLDER' at the end of the line, rather than at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert(line.length - 1, 'PLACEHOLDER');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the string 'PLACEHOLDER' at the second-to-last position of the line, rather than at the end.

DONE.
