  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would not include the `object` parameter, which is expected to be the first argument in the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would not include the `object` and `key` parameters, which are expected to be the first two arguments in the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would not include the `object`, `key`, and `value` parameters, which are expected to be the first three arguments in the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
