  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is a space, tab, or newline character, but the new code fragment also checks if `c` is `undefined`. If `c` is `undefined`, the original code fragment would return `false`, but the new code fragment would return `true`, which could cause the `parse` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is a space, tab, or newline character, but the new code fragment also checks if `c` is `null`. If `c` is `null`, the original code fragment would return `false`, but the new code fragment would return `true`, which could cause the `parse` function to return an incorrect result.
