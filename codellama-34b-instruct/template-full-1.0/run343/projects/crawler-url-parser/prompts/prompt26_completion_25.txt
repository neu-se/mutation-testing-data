  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#[^?]*/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression changes the match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is changed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*+/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different.

DONE.
