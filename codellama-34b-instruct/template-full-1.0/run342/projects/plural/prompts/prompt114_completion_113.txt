  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to consider all input words to be the same, regardless of their actual value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to match only empty strings, and all other input words would be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/foo/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to match only input words that contain the substring "foo", and all other input words would be ignored.

DONE.
