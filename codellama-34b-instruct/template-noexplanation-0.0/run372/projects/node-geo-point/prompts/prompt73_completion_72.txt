  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to calculate the destination point twice as far as it should be, which will result in a different destination point than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance / 2
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to calculate the destination point half as far as it should be, which will result in a different destination point than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 10
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to calculate the destination point 10 meters further than it should be, which will result in a different destination point than the original code.

DONE.
