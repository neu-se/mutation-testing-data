  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the iterator to advance by one more element than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the iterator to advance by one fewer element than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the iterator to advance by twice as many elements as intended.

DONE.
