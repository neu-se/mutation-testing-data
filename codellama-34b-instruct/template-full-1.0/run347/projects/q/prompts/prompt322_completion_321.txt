  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a required argument in the `promiseDispatch` method, and passing `null` instead would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a required argument in the `promiseDispatch` method, and passing an empty array instead would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a required argument in the `promiseDispatch` method, and passing a string instead would cause the method to throw an error.

DONE.
