  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different method than `allResolved` and would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a different method than `allResolved` and would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different method than `allResolved` and would return a different value.

DONE.
