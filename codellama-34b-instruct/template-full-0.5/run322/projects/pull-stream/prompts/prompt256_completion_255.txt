  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = values(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `values` is a function that returns an array of the values in the stream, whereas the original code fragment only returns the stream itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = once(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that returns a function that only runs once, whereas the original code fragment does not have this limitation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = values(stream).filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` is a function that filters out elements from an array that do not pass a certain condition, whereas the original code fragment does not have this filtering functionality.

DONE.
