Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFFFE/
```
This code fragment will match any string that starts with the byte order mark (BOM) character (U+FEFF), which is different from the original code fragment that matches any string that starts with the null character (U+0000).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0001/
