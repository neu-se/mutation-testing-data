  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream should be aborted, while `null` is a null value that has no inherent meaning in the context of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that is used to indicate that a variable or parameter has not been assigned a value, while `abort` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream should be aborted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a boolean value that indicates that the stream should not be aborted, while `abort` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream should be aborted.

DONE.
