  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if `baseUrlStr` is an empty string, which would cause the code to execute differently than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.indexOf('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `-1`, even if `baseUrlStr` contains the string `http`, which would cause the code to execute differently than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.match(/^http/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `null`, even if `baseUrlStr` starts with the string `http`, which would cause the code to execute differently than the original code.

DONE.
