  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for any stack line that contains the string `(module.js:`, regardless of whether it is a Node.js frame or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for any stack line that contains the string `(node.js:`, regardless of whether it is a Node.js frame or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for any stack line that contains the string `(node.js:)`, regardless of whether it is a Node.js frame or not.

DONE.
