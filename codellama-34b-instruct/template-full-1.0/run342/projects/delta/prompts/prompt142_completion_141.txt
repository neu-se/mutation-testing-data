  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
const c = 3;
const d = 4;
const e = 5;
const f = 6;
const g = 7;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was unnecessary and redundant. The new code fragment is not redundant and has different variable names and values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const apple = 1;
const banana = 2;
const cherry = 3;
const date = 4;
const eggplant = 5;
const fig = 6;
const grape = 7;
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment has different variable names and values, as well as a different number of variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const x = 1;
const y = 2;
const z = 3;
```
This would result in
