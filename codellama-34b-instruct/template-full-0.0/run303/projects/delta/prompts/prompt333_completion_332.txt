  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the attributes object, rather than the attributes object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first attribute in the attributes object, rather than the attributes object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new attributes object with all but the first attribute, rather than the attributes object itself.

DONE.
