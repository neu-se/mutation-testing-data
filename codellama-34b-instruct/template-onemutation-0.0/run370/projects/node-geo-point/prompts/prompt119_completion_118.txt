  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will negate the value of the `bearing` variable, which is a number. In the original code, the `bearing` variable is used as an argument to the `calculateDestination` method, which expects a number representing the bearing in degrees. By negating the value of `bearing`, we are effectively changing the direction of the bearing, which could result in a different destination point being calculated.
