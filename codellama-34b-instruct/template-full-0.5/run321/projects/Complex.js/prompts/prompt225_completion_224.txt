  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b === 0` would evaluate to `true` if `b` is equal to `0`, while the new code fragment `b !== 0` would evaluate to `false` if `b` is equal to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b === 0` would evaluate to `true` if `b` is equal to `0`, while the new code fragment `b > 0` would evaluate to `false` if `b` is equal to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b === 0` would evaluate to `true` if `b` is equal to `0`, while the new code fragment `b >= 0` would evaluate to `true`
