  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash character (`\`) is not a valid escape character in a regular expression, and it would cause the regular expression to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the forward slash character (`/`) is a valid escape character in a regular expression, and it would cause the regular expression to match a different pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the double backslash (`\\`) is a valid escape character in a regular expression, and it would cause the regular expression to match a different pattern.

DONE.
