  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is not called, so the resulting array would not be reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method is called with a different argument, so the resulting array would have a different length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method is called with a different argument, so the resulting array would have a different length and content.

DONE.
