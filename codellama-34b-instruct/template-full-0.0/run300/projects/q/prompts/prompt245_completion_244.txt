  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.stack` property would be set to the stack trace of the error, but without the first line, which would be the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.stack` property would be set to the stack trace of the error, but without the first two lines, which would be the error message and the line number where the error occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 3);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.stack` property would be set to the stack trace of the error,
