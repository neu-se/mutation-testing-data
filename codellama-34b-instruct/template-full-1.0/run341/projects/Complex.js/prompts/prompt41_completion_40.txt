  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.tan` returns the tangent of a number.

DONE.
