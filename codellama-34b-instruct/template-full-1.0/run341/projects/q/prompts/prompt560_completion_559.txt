  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration == true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, causing the code to always enter the `try` block, even if `StopIteration` is not caught.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, causing the code to always throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, causing the code to always enter the `try` block, even if `StopIteration` is caught.

DONE.
