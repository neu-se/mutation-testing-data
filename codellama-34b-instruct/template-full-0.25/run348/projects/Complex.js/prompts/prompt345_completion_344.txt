  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` is a different function from `cosh`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is a different function from `cosh`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 / cosh` is the reciprocal of `cosh`, which is a different function.

DONE.
