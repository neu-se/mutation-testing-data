 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of adding a new rule, it directly returns the string 'mice', which may cause unexpected results in the plural function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function addRule(match, result) {
  rules.push([match, result]);
  return plural;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule is added to the end of the rules array instead of the beginning, which may cause the order of rules to affect the output of the plural function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function addRule(match, result) {
  rules.unshift([match, result]);
  return 'plural';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the return value of the addRule function is changed to a string, which may cause unexpected results in the code that calls this function.

DONE.
