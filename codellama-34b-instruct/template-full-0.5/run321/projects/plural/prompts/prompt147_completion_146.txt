  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the rule's second element with the first element, which could lead to incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the rule's second element with the third element, which could lead to incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the rule's second element with the fourth element, which could lead to incorrect pluralization.

DONE.
