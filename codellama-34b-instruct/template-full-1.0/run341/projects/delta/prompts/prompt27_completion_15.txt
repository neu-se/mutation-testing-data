  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not check for null values, and the new code fragment would return null if any of the object properties are null, which may cause the test to pass unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not check for undefined values, and the new code fragment would return undefined if any of the object properties are undefined, which may cause the test to pass unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not check for the truthiness of the object properties, and the new code fragment would return 1 if any of the object properties are truthy, which may cause the test to pass unexpectedly.

DONE.
