  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekType()` returns the type of the operation at the current position, while `thisIter.peekType` returns the type of the operation at the next position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the operation at the current position, while `thisIter.peekType` returns the type of the operation at the next position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekOp()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekOp()` returns the operation at the current position, while `thisIter.peekType` returns the type of the operation at the next position.

DONE.
