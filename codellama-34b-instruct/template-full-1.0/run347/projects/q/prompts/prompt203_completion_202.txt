  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"%"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `%` character is used for string formatting, and the code that follows the `@` character assumes that it is the "at" symbol, not a formatting character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `#` character is used for comments, and the code that follows the `@` character assumes that it is the "at" symbol, not a comment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"?"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` character is used for optional parameters, and the code that follows the `@` character assumes that it is the "at" symbol, not an optional parameter.

DONE.
