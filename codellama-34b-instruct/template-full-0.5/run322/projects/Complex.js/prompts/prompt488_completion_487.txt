  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the resulting value to be a string, not a boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule" + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ "foo"` operator would cause the resulting value to be a string, not a boolean.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule" - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would cause the resulting value to be a string, not a boolean.

DONE.
