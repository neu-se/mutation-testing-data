  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(void 0, array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `apply` method to call the `callback` function with the `array` as the arguments, while the new code uses the `apply` method to call the `callback` function with the `void 0` as the `this` value and the `array` as the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(void 0, array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `apply` method to call the `callback` function with the `array` as the arguments, while the new code uses the `apply` method to call the `callback` function with the `void 0` as the `this` value and the `array` as the arguments.
