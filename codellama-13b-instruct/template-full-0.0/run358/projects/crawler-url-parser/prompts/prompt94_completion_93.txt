  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `href` string to lowercase, which could affect the comparison with the `baseUrlStr` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method would remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the `href` string, which could affect the comparison with the `baseUrlStr` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove the `http://` or `https://` prefix from the `href` string, which could affect the comparison with the `baseUrlStr` string.

DONE.
