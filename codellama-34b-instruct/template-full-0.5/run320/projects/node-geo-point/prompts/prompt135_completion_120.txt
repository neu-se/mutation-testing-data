  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toPrecision
```
This would result in different behavior because `toPrecision` returns a string representing the input number in fixed-point or exponential notation rounded to `precision` significant digits, whereas `toFixed` returns a string representing the input number in fixed-point notation rounded to `precision` decimal places.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toExponential
```
This would result in different behavior because `toExponential` returns a string representing the input number in exponential notation rounded to `precision` significant digits, whereas `toFixed` returns a string representing the input number in fixed-point notation rounded to `precision` decimal places.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toLocaleString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLocaleString` returns a string representing the input number in a localized format, whereas `toFixed` returns a string representing the input number in fixed-point notation rounded
