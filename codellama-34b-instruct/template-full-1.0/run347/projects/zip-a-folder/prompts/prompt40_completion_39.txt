  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{"src".split(",")}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array with only one element, instead of an array with multiple elements, as the original code would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{"src".split(/[\,]/)}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the string using a regular expression, instead of a string literal, which could produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{"src".split(null)}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the string using a null character, instead of a comma, which could produce different results.

DONE.
