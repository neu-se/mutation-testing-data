  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid_country_id"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return `null` instead of a country object, which would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to return `null` instead of an array of timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"country_id"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return a country object with the same ID as the input, which would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to return an array of timezones for that country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"country_id" + "invalid_suffix"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return `null` instead of a country object, which would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to return `null` instead of an array of timezones.
