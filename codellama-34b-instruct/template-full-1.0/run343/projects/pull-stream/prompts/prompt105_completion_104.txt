  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function expects a non-null value as its first argument, while `undefined` is a nullish value that would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function expects a non-string value as its first argument, while a string value would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function expects a truthy value as its first argument, while `false` is a falsy value that would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
