  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the property value instead of retrieving it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the property instead of retrieving it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"otherProperty"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve a different property than expected.

DONE.
