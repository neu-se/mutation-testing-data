  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(a[key], b[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function is used to compare the values of the `a` and `b` objects, whereas the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to compare the values directly. This could result in different behavior if the `isEqual` function is not implemented correctly or if the values being compared are not of the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used to compare the values of the `a` and `b` objects, whereas the original code fragment uses the `isEqual` function to compare the values. This could result in different behavior if the `isEqual` function is not implemented correctly or if the values being compared are not of the same type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
