 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function context, which could affect variable scoping and closure behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately sends a success callback, even if there is an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends a success callback with a truthy value, which might not be handled correctly by the calling code.

DONE.
