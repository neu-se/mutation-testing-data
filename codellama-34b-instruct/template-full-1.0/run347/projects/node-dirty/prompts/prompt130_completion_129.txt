  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key: cbs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the variable `key` to the first element of the `cbs` array, while the original code sets `key` to the current element of the `Dirty` object's properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[key] = cbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `cbs` array to the `key` property of the `Dirty` object, while the original code assigns the `key` property to the current element of the `cbs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs[0] = key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `key` variable to the first element of the `cbs` array, while the original code assigns the first element of the `cbs` array to the `key` variable.

DONE.
