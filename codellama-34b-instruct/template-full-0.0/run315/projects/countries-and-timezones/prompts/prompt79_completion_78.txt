  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` argument, which would return a timezone object with the given name, rather than the `getTimezone` function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object with the given name from the `timezones` object, rather than the `getTimezone` function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name].name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the timezone object with the given name from the `timezones` object, rather than the `getTimezone` function itself.

DONE.
