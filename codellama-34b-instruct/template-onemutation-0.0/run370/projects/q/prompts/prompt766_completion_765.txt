  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    deferred.reject(err);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` does not have any effect on the promise, while the new code fragment `function (err) { deferred.reject(err); }` will reject the promise with the error `err`.
