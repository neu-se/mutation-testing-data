  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function that returned a value, while this new code fragment throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return "This is a buggy code fragment";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function that threw an error, while this new code fragment returns a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function that threw an error, while this new code fragment returns undefined.

DONE.
