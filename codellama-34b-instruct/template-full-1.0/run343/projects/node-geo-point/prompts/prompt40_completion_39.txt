  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, which has a different formula than `sin`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is the tangent function, which has a different formula than `sin`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `sqrt` is the square root function, which has a different formula than `sin`.

DONE.
