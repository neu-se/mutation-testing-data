  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--this._inFlightWrites;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not executed, and therefore the write stream would not have been corked and the data would not have been written to the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not executed, and therefore the queue would not have been emptied and the data would not have been processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not executed, and therefore the data would not have been cleared from the queue and the data would not have been processed.

DONE.
