 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(a, b) => Math.atan(b / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the regular arctangent function instead of the quadrant-specific arctangent function, which can lead to incorrect results for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because it only takes one argument instead of two, leading to incorrect results or errors when the input values are not in the correct range.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(b, a) => Math.atan2(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the input arguments, which can lead to incorrect results for certain input values due to the quadrant-specific nature of the arctangent function.

DONE.
