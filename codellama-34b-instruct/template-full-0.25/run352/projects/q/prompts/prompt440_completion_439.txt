  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable is not a promise, so it would not be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array only contains promises that have been reported as unhandled rejections, so it would not include all unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array only contains the reasons for unhandled rejections, so it would not include the promises themselves.

DONE.
