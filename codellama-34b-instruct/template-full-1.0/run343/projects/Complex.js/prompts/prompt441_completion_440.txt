  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the division would be 0, even if the value of `this['im']` is not 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would be added after the division, causing the result to be different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the division would be one less than the original code fragment, even if the value of `this['im']` is 0.

DONE.
