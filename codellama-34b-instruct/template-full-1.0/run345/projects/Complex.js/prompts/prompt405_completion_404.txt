  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (x['re'] + x['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment uses the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would produce a different value from the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (x['re'] - x['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment uses the difference of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would produce a different value from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (x['re'] * x['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment uses the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would produce a different value from the original code fragment.

DONE.
