  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the first point instead of the latitude, leading to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the first point instead of the longitude, leading to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the cosine of the latitude instead of the latitude itself, leading to a different calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
