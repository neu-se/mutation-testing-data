  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && this['im'] === 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `this['im']` is 0, but this new code also checks if `this['isInfinite']()` is true. If `this['isInfinite']()` is true and `this['im']` is 0, the new code would return "Infinity", while the original code would return "NaN".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['im'] === 0 && this['re'] === 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `this['im']` is 0, but this new code also checks if `this['re']` is 0. If `this['im']` is 0 and `this['re']` is 0, the new code would return "Infinity", while the original code would return "NaN".
