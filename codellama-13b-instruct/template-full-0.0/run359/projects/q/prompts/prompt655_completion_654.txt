  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.property
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing a property of the object instead of the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.method()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be calling a method of the object instead of accessing a property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.method.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be calling a method of the object with a different context (i.e., `this`) than the original code.

DONE.
