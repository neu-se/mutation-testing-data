 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the array instead of the last one, affecting the order of the rows loaded from the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new shallow copy of the array, causing the original `arr` not to be modified and the `buffer` variable to remain unchanged, leading to potential data loss or corruption.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it completely removes the line of code that processes the `chunk` and updates the `_data` object, causing the database to fail loading the data from the file and not updating the in-memory cache.

DONE.
