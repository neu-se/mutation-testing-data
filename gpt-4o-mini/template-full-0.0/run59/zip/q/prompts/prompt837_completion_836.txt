Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError = process.domain.bind(console.log);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error handling to log the error to the console instead of throwing it, which could lead to unhandled promise rejections not being reported properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError = process.domain.bind(function() { return null; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively ignores the error by returning `null`, preventing any error handling logic from being executed, which could lead to silent failures in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError = process.domain.bind(function(error) { throw new Error("Custom error: " + error.message); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the original error in a new error with a custom message, which could obscure the original error details and make debugging more difficult.

DONE.
