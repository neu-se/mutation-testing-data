  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.isFulfilled())
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isFulfilled()` returns a boolean value indicating whether the promise is fulfilled, whereas `promise.inspect()` expects a function that will be called with the promise's state as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.isRejected())
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isRejected()` returns a boolean value indicating whether the promise is rejected, whereas `promise.inspect()` expects a function that will be called with the promise's state as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.isPending())
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isPending()` returns a boolean value indicating whether the promise is pending, whereas `promise.inspect()` expects a
