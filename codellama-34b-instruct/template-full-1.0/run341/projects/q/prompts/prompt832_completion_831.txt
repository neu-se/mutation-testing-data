  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `rejected` branch would be taken instead of the `fulfilled` branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `-Infinity` is a falsy value, so the `rejected` branch would be taken instead of the `fulfilled` branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a truthy value, so the `fulfilled` branch would be taken instead of the `rejected` branch.

DONE.
