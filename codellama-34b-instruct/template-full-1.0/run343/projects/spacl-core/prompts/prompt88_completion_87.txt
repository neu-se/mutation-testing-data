  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.forEach((policy) => [policy.name, policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because `foreach()` return `undefined`, and no iterable will be created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...policies].map((policy) => [policy.name, policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` return a new array, but `[...policies]` will create a temporary array, which is unnecessary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map((policy) => [policy.name, policy])
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code.

DONE.
