 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'chili', 'chilis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the British English spelling 'chillies', while this change uses the American English spelling 'chilis'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'chilli', 'chilliplural'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the array is not a valid plural form of 'chilli'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'chilli', function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function used to generate the plural form is different from the original code, which uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies'`.

DONE.
