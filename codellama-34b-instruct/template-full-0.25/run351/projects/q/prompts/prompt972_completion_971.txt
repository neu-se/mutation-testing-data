  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array with the first element removed, which would cause the `nmapply` method to pass the wrong arguments to the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new array with the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function added to the end, which would cause the `nmapply` method to pass the wrong arguments to the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method would remove the last element from the `args` array, which would cause the `nmapply` method to pass the wrong arguments to the `post` method.

DONE.
