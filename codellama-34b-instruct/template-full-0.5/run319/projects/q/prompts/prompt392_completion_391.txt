  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks is changed, which could cause issues if the callbacks are dependent on each other.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed, 42
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `42` would be passed to the callbacks, which could cause issues if the callbacks are not designed to handle it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed, Q.when(value, fulfilled, rejected, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `Q.when(value, fulfilled, rejected, progressed)` would be passed to the callbacks, which could cause issues if the callbacks are not designed to handle it.

DONE.
