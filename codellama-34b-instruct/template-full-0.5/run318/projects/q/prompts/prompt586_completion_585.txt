  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with an argument of `1`, which would likely cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with an argument of `"foo"`, which would likely cause it to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)(Q.when(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with an argument of `Q.when(1)`, which would likely cause it to return a different value.

DONE.
