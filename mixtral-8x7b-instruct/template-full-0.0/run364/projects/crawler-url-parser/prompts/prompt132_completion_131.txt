 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index|default\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines the original regex with another alternative, potentially matching more strings than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/default\.[a-z]+|index\.html?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new alternative to the regex, which now matches 'index.html' or 'index.html?' at the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'g' flag is added, causing the regex to search for matches throughout the entire string instead of stopping after the first match.

DONE.
