  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `cosh` function instead of `sinh` for the real part of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `cosh` function for the real part of the result, but with the arguments reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `cosh` function for the real part of the result, but with the arguments reversed.

DONE.
