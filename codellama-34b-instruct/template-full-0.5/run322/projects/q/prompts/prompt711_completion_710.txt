  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is not a valid method for a promise, whereas "keys" is a valid method that returns the keys of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because "length" is not a valid method for a promise, whereas "keys" is a valid method that returns the keys of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"toString"
```
This would result in different behavior because "toString" is a valid method for a promise, but it would return the string representation of the promise, not the keys of the object.

DONE.
