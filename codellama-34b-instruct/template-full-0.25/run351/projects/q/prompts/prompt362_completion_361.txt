  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that handles rejected promises, while `_fulfilled` is a function that handles fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that handles progress notifications, while `_fulfilled` is a function that handles fulfilled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(value, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that handles fulfilled promises, and passing `true` as the second argument would cause the function to return a resolved promise with the value `true`, rather than the original value.

DONE.
