  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.charAt(0) === 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the first character of the `pageurl` variable, and it would always return `false` if the first character is not `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.indexOf('a') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the string `a` is present in the `pageurl` variable, and it would always return `false` if the string `a` is not present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.endsWith('a')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `pageurl` variable ends with the character `a`, and it would always return `false` if the variable does not end with `a`.

DONE.
