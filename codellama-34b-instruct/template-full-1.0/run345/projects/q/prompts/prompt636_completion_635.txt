  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.proxiedObject.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.proxiedObject` is not a `Promise` object, and therefore does not have a `dispatch` method. Instead, it would throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is not a method, but a property that holds a reference to the `dispatch` method. Therefore, calling `this.dispatch.bind(null)` would return a new function that is not bound to `this` and would not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.prototype.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `dispatch` method to a new object that is not a `Promise` object, and therefore does not have a `dispatch` method. Instead, it would throw
