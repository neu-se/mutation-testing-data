  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `stream` is both truthy and an object, while the mutated code checks if `stream` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream && stream.hasOwnProperty('length')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `stream` is both truthy and an object, while the mutated code also checks if `stream` has a `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!stream || 'object' !== typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `stream` is both truthy and an object, while the mutated code checks if `stream` is falsy or not an object.

DONE.
