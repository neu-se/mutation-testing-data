  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft >= 0
```
This change will cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a negative argument, which will result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft > 1
```
This change will cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a smaller argument than expected, which will result in an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft < 0
```
This change will cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a negative argument, which will result in an error.

DONE.
