  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `length` variable, which is not defined in the context of the `rest` method. Using `0` as the argument would cause the method to return an empty array, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
