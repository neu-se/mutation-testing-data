  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would set the value of the map to `null` instead of the `policy` object, which would cause the `query` and `matches` methods to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would set the value of the map to `undefined` instead of the `policy` object, which would cause the `query` and `matches` methods to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Policy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would create a new `Policy` object instead of using the existing one, which would cause the `query` and `matches` methods to return incorrect results.

DONE.
