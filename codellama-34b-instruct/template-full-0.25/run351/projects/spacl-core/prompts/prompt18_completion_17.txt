  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[*+]/g` matches any occurrence of `*` or `+` in the `spec` string, and replaces them with an empty string. This would cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression, which could potentially match different inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+]/g, '\\$&')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[*+]/g` matches any occurrence of `*` or `+` in the `spec` string, and replaces them with a backreference to the matched substring. This would cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression, which could potentially match different inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+]/g, '\\$&')
```
This would result in different behavior because
