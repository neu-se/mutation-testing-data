  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "undefined" if the `process` variable is not defined, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.env.Q_DEBUG` property would be `undefined` if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is not set, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `process` variable is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG !== "true"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.env.Q_DEBUG` property would be a string, and the `!==` operator would check for strict equality, so the `if` statement
