  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the argument to the `Math.sin` function to be negated, which would change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*2
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the `Math.sin` function would be doubled, which would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the `Math.sin` function would be incremented by 1, which would change the result of the function.

DONE.
