  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would return a different result when the `true` parameter is changed to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would return a different result when the `true` parameter is changed to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would return a different result when the `true` parameter is changed to `undefined`.

DONE.
