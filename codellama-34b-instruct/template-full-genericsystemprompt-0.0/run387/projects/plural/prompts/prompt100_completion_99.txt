  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment would always return the letter "a", regardless of the input word, whereas the original code fragment would return the correct plural form of the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'e' + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment would always return the string "ea", regardless of the input word, whereas the original code fragment would return the correct plural form of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'e' + 'a' + 'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment would always return the string "eab", regardless of the input word, whereas the original code fragment would return the correct plural form of the input word.

DONE.
