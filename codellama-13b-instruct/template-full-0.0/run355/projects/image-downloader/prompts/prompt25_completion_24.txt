  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__dirname, options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because the `__dirname` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `options.dest` variable is not a valid path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(__dirname, options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `__dirname` variable is now defined in the current scope, and the `options.dest` variable is a valid path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.resolve(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.dest` variable is now resolved to an absolute path.

DONE.
