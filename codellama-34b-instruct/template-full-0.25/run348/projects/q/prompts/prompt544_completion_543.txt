  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is defined. This would cause the `isStopIteration` function to return `true` if `StopIteration` is defined, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the `spawn` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is an object. This would cause the `isStopIteration` function to return `true` if `StopIteration` is an object, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the `spawn` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `
