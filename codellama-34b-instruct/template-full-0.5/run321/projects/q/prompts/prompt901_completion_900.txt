  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Timed out after " + ms + " ms"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.reject(error)` which would reject the promise with the provided error object, while the new code fragment would reject the promise with a new error object created using the `Error` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.reject(error)` which would reject the promise with the provided error object, while the new code fragment would resolve the promise with the provided value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.reject(error)` which would reject the promise with the provided error object, while the new code fragment would notify the promise with the provided value.
