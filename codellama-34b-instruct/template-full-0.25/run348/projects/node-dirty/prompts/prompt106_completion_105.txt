  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `val` property of the `row` object, while this replacement code fragment returns the value of the `val` property plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `val` property of the `row` object, while this replacement code fragment returns the value of the `val` property multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `val` property of the `row` object, while this replacement code fragment returns the value of the `val` property converted to uppercase.

DONE.
