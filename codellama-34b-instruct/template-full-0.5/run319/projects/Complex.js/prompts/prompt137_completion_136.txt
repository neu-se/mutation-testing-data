  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite() && z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to return `Complex.NAN` when both operands are infinite, whereas the original code would return `Complex.INFINITY`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite() || z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to return `Complex.INFINITY` when either operand is infinite, whereas the original code would return `Complex.NAN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite() || z.isInfinite() || this.isZero() && z.isZero()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to return `Complex.INFINITY` when either operand is infinite or both operands are zero, whereas the original
