  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable is not null, and the callback will be called with a different argument than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable is not true, and the callback will be called with a different argument than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable is not a valid error code, and the callback will be called with a different argument than expected.

DONE.
