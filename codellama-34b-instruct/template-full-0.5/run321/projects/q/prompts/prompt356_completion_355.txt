  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a rejected promise, while the new code fragment would throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a rejected promise, while the new code fragment would return a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a rejected promise, while the new code fragment would return a rejected promise with the value `exception`.

DONE.
