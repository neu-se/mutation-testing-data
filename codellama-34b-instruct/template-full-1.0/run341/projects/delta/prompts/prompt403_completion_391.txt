  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values of the object's own properties, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of the keys of the object's own properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is a reference to the object that is used as the prototype for objects created with the Object constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object[Symbol.iterator]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object[Symbol.iterator]` is a placeholder for the iterator function for objects that are iterable by default.

DONE.
