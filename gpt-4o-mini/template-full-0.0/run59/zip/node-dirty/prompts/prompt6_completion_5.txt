Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value associated with the key to `null` instead of the intended value, which may lead to unexpected results when retrieving the value later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it deletes the key from the `_data` map instead of setting its value, which means that the key will no longer exist in the map and any subsequent calls to `get(key)` will return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(val, key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly sets the value as the key and the key as the value, effectively reversing their roles, which would lead to incorrect data storage and retrieval.

DONE.
