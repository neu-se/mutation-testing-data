  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `name` can be `undefined` even if `data.countries[id]` exists, but the original code fragment only checks if `name` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data.countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.countries[id]` can exist even if `name` is falsy, but the original code fragment only checks for the existence of `name`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `name` can be an empty string even if `data.countries[id]` exists, but the original code fragment only checks if `name` is falsy.

DONE.
