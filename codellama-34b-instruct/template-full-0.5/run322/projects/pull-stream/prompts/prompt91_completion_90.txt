  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `test`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `test`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `test`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different result.

DONE.
