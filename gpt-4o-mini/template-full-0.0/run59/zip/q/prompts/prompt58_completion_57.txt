Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `setImmediate` is an object instead of a function, which would incorrectly allow the code to proceed even if `setImmediate` is not callable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the negation of the original condition, leading to the code executing the else block even when `setImmediate` is indeed a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `setImmediate` is an instance of `Function`, which may not be a reliable check in all environments, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about its availability.

DONE.
