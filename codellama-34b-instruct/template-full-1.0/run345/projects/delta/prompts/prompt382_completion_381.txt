  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would continue to iterate through the other iterator with the same length, potentially missing or double-counting operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate through the other iterator with a length that is one greater than the original length, potentially missing or double-counting operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate through the other iterator with a length that is twice the original length, potentially missing or double-counting operations.

DONE.
