  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `src + 1` would change the value of `src`, potentially causing the `access` call to fail if the new value is not a valid file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `src / 2` would divide the value of `src` by 2, potentially changing its type and causing the `access` call to fail if the new value is not a valid file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `src === 0` would perform a comparison between `src` and 0, potentially causing the `access` call to fail if the comparison fails.

DONE.
