  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` would throw an error if `err` is not defined, but replacing it with `null` would not throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` would throw an error if `err` is not defined, but replacing it with `undefined` would not throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` would throw an error if `err` is not defined, but replacing it with `0` would not throw an error.

DONE.
