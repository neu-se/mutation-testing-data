  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, while `deferred.resolve` would resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the progress of the promise, while `deferred.resolve` would resolve it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is `undefined`, and replacing `deferred.resolve` with `undefined` would cause an error.

DONE.
