  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This change will cause the `isInfinite` method to be called on the `Complex` object, which will return a boolean value indicating whether the complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This change will cause the `isInfinite` method to be called on both the `Complex` object and the `z` object, and the results will be combined using the `&&` operator. This will return `true` if both complex numbers are infinite, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] || z['isInfinite']
```
This change will cause the `isInfinite` method to be called on both the `Complex` object and the `z` object, and the results will be combined using the `||` operator. This will return `true` if either complex number
