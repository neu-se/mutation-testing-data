  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var j
```
This would result in different behavior because `var j` is a different variable than `var k`, which is used in the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` is not defined in the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinks[k]
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinks[k]` is not the same as `sinks`.

DONE.
