  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, and the unhandled rejection would not be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, and the unhandled rejection would not be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with the `this` keyword as the argument, which would not remove the unhandled rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
