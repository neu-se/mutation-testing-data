Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `onAbort` means that the abort callback will not have the intended behavior associated with the `onAbort` function, potentially leading to unhandled abort scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, true, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `true` instead of `abort` will cause the abort callback to be invoked with a truthy value, which may not be the intended signal for aborting the operation, leading to incorrect handling of the abort logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `cb` as the third argument instead of `onAbort` means that the abort callback will be invoked with the callback function itself, which could lead to recursive calls or unexpected behavior during the abort process.

DONE.
