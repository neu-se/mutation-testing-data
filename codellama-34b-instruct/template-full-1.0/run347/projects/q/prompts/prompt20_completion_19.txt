  Thank you for the feedback. Here are three new options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (head === null) {
  head = tail = {task: void 0, next: null};
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reinitialize the linked list every time the `runSingle` function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (head.task === undefined) {
  head = tail = {task: void 0, next: null};
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only reinitialize the linked list if the `head` node is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (head.next === null) {
  head = tail = {task: void 0, next: null};
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only reinitialize the linked list if the `head` node's `next` property is null.

DONE.
