  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `fn`, which is a function that takes two arguments, while `this.get(key)` is a method that takes one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `fn`, which is a function that takes two arguments, while `this._data.get(key)` is a method that takes one argument and returns a value from the `_data` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `fn`, which is a function that takes two arguments, while `this._data.set(key, val)` is a method that takes two arguments and sets a value in the `_data` object.

DONE.
