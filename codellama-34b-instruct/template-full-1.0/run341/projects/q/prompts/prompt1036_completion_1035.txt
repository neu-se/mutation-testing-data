  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Q.defer` to create a new promise, while the replacement code uses `Q.reject` to create a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ head: Q.resolve, tail: Q.defer }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Q.defer` to create a new promise, while the replacement code creates a new promise with a `head` property set to the result of `Q.resolve` and a `tail` property set to a new promise created with `Q.defer`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ head: 42, tail: Q.defer }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Q.defer` to create a new promise, while the replacement code creates a new promise with a `head` property set to the number 42
