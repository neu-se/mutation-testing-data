  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"args"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a string "args" being passed as an argument to the function, rather than the actual arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in no arguments being passed to the function, rather than the actual arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in no arguments being passed to the function, rather than the actual arguments object.

DONE.
