  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to advance by a different number of elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator, which could cause the `next` method to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method returns a boolean indicating whether there are more elements in the iteration, which could cause the `next` method to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
