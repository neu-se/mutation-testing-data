Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `options` would cause the `getCountry` function to ignore any options that might modify the behavior of the country retrieval, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an options object with `deprecated: true` would change the way timezones are delivered in the `deliverCountry` function, potentially including deprecated timezones that would otherwise be excluded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ allTimezones: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an options object with `allTimezones: true` would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return the `allTimezones` property instead of the `timezones` property, which could lead to a different set of timezones being returned for the country.

DONE.
