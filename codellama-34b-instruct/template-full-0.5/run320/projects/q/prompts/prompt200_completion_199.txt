  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `split` method on the `stack` property of the `Error` object, which is not a valid method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `split` method on the `stack` property of the `Error` object, which is not a valid method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `split` method on the `stack` property of the `Error` object, which is not a valid method.

DONE.
