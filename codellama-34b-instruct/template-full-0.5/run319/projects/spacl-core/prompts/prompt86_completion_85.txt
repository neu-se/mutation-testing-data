  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is not defined on the `rule` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method expects only one argument, but we are passing two arguments. This would cause a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method expects a `Policy` object as its first argument, but we are passing a `string` object. This would cause a `TypeError`.

DONE.
