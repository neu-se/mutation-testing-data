  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```let x = <PLACEHOLDER>;```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a value to the variable 'x' instead of leaving it undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<PLACEHOLDER> = true;```
This would result in different behavior because it would reassign the value of the variable 'x' to 'true', even if it was previously defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```if (x === <PLACEHOLDER>) { x = !x; }```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of 'x' is equal to the original value of the PLACEHOLDER, and then reassign 'x' to the opposite value.
