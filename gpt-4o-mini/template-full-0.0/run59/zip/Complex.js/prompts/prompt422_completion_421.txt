Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, causing the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` for any input, regardless of whether the complex number is actually zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero instead of the actual complex number, potentially leading to incorrect results when the real part is zero but the imaginary part is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the sum of the real and imaginary parts is zero, which is not a valid condition for determining if the complex number is zero, leading to incorrect handling of the zero case.

DONE.
