  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign is different from the original code fragment, which is `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, whereas the new code fragment is `b + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, whereas the new code fragment is `b` squared.

DONE.
