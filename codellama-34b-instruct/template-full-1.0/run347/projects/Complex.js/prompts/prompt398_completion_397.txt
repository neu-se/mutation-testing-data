  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] = -this['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, resulting in a different value for the `asinh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] = -this['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the real part of the complex number, resulting in a different value for the `asinh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var res = this['asin']();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `asin` function to the complex number, rather than the `asinh` function, resulting in a different value.

DONE.
