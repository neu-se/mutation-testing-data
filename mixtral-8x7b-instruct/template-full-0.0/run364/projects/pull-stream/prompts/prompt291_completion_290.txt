 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now pass items through the first time they are seen, instead of the second time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now only pass items through when the length of the `field` array is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() > 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now pass items through randomly, instead of always passing them through the second time they are seen.

DONE.
