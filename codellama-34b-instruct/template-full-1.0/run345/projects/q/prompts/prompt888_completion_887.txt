  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, whereas the original code fragment returned a random number between 0 and 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 2, whereas the original code fragment returned a random number between 0 and 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a random number between 0 and 2, whereas the original code fragment returned a random number between 0 and 1.

DONE.
