  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator is being replaced with `||`, which means that the code would only check if `point` has the property `type` but not if it has the property `coordinates`. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `point` object does not have the `type` or `coordinates` properties, as the code would still pass the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') && !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator is being replaced with `&&`, which means that the code would check if `point` has both the properties `type` and `coordinates`. If `point` does not have both of these properties, the code would still pass the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEH
