  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because `ended` is being assigned the opposite value of `end`, which is passed as a parameter to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `ended` is being assigned the opposite value of itself, which could cause an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = true
```
This would result in different behavior because `ended` is being assigned a constant value of `true`, which could cause the function to return early without reading the entire input.

DONE.
