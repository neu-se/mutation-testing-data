  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise, while this new code fragment throws an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise, while this new code fragment returns a resolved promise with the exception as its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with the exception as its reason, while this new code fragment returns a rejected promise with a different reason.

DONE.
