  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `Q.longStackSupport`, causing the `hasStacks` variable to be checked even if long stack support is not enabled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `hasStacks` variable to be checked only if long stack support is not enabled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `hasStacks`, causing the `Q.longStackSupport` variable to be checked only if stacks are not available.

DONE.
