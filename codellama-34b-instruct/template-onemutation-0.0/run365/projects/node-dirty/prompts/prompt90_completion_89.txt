  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only emits an error if the row is empty, while the new code fragment emits an error regardless of the row's contents.
