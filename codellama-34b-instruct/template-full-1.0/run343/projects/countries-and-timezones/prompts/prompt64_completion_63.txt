  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `deliverTimezone` is a different function than `deliverCountry`, and it has a different return type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[getCountry(id, options).timezones, options]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the list of timezones for the country with the given ID, without checking if the timezone is deprecated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[getCountry(id, options).allTimezones, options]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the list of all timezones for the country with the given ID, including deprecated ones.

DONE.
