  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable is undefined, rather than checking if it is falsey.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable is not null, rather than checking if it is falsey.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fileNameAndLineNumber.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable has a length of 0, rather than checking if it is falsey.

DONE.
