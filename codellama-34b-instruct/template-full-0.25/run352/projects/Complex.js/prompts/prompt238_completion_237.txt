  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.abs` function to always return the absolute value of the real part of the complex number, rather than the magnitude of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.atan2` function to use a different value for the `b` parameter, which would affect the result of the `arg` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.exp` function to use a different value for the `a` parameter, which would affect the result of the `exp` function.

DONE.
