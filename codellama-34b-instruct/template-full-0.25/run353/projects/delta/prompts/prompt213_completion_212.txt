  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that inserts a new operation at the specified index, whereas `push` is a method that appends a new operation to the end of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a method that removes and returns the last operation in the delta, whereas `push` is a method that appends a new operation to the end of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` is a method that inserts a new operation at the beginning of the delta, whereas `push` is a method that appends a new operation to the end of the delta.

DONE.
