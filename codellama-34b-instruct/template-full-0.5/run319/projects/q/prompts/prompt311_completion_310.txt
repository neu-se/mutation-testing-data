  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a new promise that is already resolved, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a new promise that is pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a new promise that is already rejected, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a new promise that is pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.notify()` returns a new promise that is already notified, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a new promise that is pending.

DONE.
