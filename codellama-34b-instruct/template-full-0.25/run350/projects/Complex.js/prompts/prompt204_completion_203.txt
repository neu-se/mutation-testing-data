  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value, which would then be used to calculate the `sin` and `cos` values, resulting in a different complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value, which would then be used to calculate the `sin` and `cos` values, resulting in a different complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value, which would then be used to calculate the `sin` and `cos` values, resulting in a different complex number.

DONE.
