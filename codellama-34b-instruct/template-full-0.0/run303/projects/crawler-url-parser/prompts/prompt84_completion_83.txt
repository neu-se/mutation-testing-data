  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first word of the link text, rather than the entire link text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the link text to lowercase, which could affect the accuracy of the link type classification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all non-word and non-whitespace characters from the link text, which could affect the accuracy of the link type classification.

DONE.
