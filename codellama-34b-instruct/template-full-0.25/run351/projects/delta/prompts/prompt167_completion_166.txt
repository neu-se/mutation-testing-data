  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes a given number of elements from the delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds a new element to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a method that removes the last element from the delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds a new element to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` is a method that removes the first element from the delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds a new element to the delta.

DONE.
