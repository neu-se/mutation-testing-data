  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `newValue`, and would cause the `deferred.notify` method to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `newValue`, and would cause the `deferred.notify` method to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a different value than `newValue`, and would cause the `deferred.notify` method to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
