  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable is now incremented by 1 before being passed to the `reject` method, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would now be called with a `null` value, which could cause the promise to be rejected with an unrelated error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would now be called with an `undefined` value, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different error.

DONE.
