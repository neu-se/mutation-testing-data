  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called with a different argument than the original code, and it would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).done(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is called with a different argument than the original code, and it would reject the promise instead of resolving it.

DONE.
