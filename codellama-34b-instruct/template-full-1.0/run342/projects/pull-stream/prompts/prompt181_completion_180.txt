  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function that takes no arguments, while `onAbort()` invokes the function and may return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and `onAbort + 1` would attempt to add the value `1` to the function, which would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the current `this` context, while `onAbort` is a function that is not bound to any specific context.
