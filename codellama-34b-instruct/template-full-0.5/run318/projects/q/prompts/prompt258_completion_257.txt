  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called instead of the `resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the value passed to `Q` is different from the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return reject(value); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `Q`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
