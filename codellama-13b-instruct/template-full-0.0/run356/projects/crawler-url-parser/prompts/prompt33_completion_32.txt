  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match URLs that start with "https://" instead of "http://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match URLs that start with "ftp://" instead of "http://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match URLs that start with "file://" instead of "http://".

DONE.
