  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called for fulfilled promises, but not for rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called for any state other than rejected, including fulfilled and pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called for pending promises, but not for fulfilled or rejected promises.

DONE.
