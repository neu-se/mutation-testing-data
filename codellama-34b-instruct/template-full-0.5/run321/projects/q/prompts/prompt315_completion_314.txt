  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `fallback` function to be called even if it is not defined, which could cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `fallback` function to be called even if it is not a function, which could cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof fallback !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `fallback` function to be called even if it is not a function, which could cause the code to fail.

DONE.
