  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual(a[key], b[key])` checks for deep equality, while `a[key] !== b[key]` only checks for shallow equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional check for shallow equality, which may not be necessary in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) || a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logical operator from `&&` to `||`, which may result in different behavior in certain cases.

DONE.
