  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` and `deferred.reject` are two different functions with different purposes. `deferred.resolve` is used to resolve a promise with a value, while `deferred.reject` is used to reject a promise with a reason. Replacing `deferred.reject` with `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a function that notifies progress listeners of the promise, while `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise. Replacing `deferred.reject` with `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The
