  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return `null` instead of the expected data, which will result in an error when the `cb` function is called with `null` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return `undefined` instead of the expected data, which will result in an error when the `cb` function is called with `undefined` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return the string "foo" instead of the expected data, which will result in an error when the `cb` function is called with "foo" as an argument.

DONE.
