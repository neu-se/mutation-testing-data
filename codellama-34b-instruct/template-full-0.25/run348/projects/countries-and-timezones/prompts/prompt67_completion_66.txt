  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `options` object to the `countries[id]` property, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] += options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `options` object to the `countries[id]` property, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = options.country
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `country` property of the `options` object to the `countries[id]` property, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
