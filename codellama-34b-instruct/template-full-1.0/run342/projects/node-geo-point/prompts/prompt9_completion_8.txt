  Sure, here are three potential buggy code fragments to replace the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Type'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw an error when the `point` object does not have the property `'Type'` instead of `'type'`, which is the correct property name according to the GeoJSON specification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinate'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw an error when the `point` object does not have the property `'coordinate'` instead of `'coordinates'`, which is the correct property name according to the GeoJSON specification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'distance'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment, because the `distance` property is not
