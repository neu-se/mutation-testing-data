  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but `undefined` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but the new function `function () {}` does not take any arguments and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
