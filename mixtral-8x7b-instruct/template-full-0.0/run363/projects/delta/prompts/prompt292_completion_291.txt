 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition now includes the case where index is equal to 0, which might cause the line to be split differently than before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition now includes the case where index is equal to -1, which might cause the line to be split differently than before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index >= -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition now includes the case where index is equal to -1, which might cause the line to be split differently than before.

DONE.
