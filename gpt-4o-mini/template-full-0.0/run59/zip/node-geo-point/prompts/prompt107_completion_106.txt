Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly increases the zoom level by 1, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the tile's x-coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(3, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the base of the exponentiation from 2 to 3, which would significantly alter the calculation of the tile's x-coordinate, resulting in incorrect tile positioning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor((coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom - 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly decreases the zoom level by 1, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the tile's x-coordinate, potentially causing the tile to be misaligned.

DONE.
