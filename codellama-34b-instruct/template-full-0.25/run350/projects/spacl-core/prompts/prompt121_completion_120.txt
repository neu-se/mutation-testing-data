  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(this.regex, ''), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would modify the `path` variable, potentially causing the `matches` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split(this.regex), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the `path` variable into an array of substrings, potentially causing the `matches` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(this.regex.lastIndex), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would extract a substring from the `path` variable, potentially causing the `matches` method to return a different result.

DONE.
