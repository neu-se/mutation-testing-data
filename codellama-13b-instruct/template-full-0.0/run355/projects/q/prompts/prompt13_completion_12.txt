  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ses.ok()` function returns `true` if the current environment is a secure environment, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, the `ses.ok()` function is used to check if the current environment is a secure environment, and if it is, the code will execute. By replacing the `ses.ok()` function with `!ses.ok()`, the code will execute only if the current environment is not a secure environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok() && ses.secure()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ses.secure()` function returns `true` if the current environment is a secure environment, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, the `ses.secure()` function is used to check if the current environment is a secure environment, and if it is, the code will execute. By replacing the `ses.ok()` function with `ses.ok()
