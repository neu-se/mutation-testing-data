  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] == Infinity && Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!Number.isFinite(a['abs'])` check to ensure that `a['abs']` is not infinite, but this modified code fragment does not include that check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] == -Infinity && Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!Number.isFinite(a['abs'])` check to ensure that `a['abs']` is not infinite, but this modified code fragment checks for `a['abs']` being equal to negative infinity instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] == Infinity && a['arg'] == Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!
