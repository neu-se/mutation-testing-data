  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `null`, as the `path` variable is not modified and the `toLowerCase()` method does not change the value of the variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `null`, as the `path` variable is not modified and the `substring()` method does not change the value of the variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0]
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `null`, as the `path` variable is not modified and the `split()` method does not change the value of the variable.

DONE.
