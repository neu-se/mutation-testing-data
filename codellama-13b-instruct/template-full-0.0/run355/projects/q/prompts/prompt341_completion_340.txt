  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` keyword is used to defer the execution of a function until the current call stack is cleared. In the original code, the `defer` keyword is used to defer the execution of the `promiseDispatch` function until the current call stack is cleared, which is necessary to ensure that the `promiseDispatch` function is called after the current call stack is cleared. However, in the buggy code fragment, the `defer` keyword is not used, which means that the `promiseDispatch` function will be called immediately, which can cause the `promiseDispatch` function to be called before the current call stack is cleared, which can result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    self.promiseDispatch(function (value) {
        if (done) {
            return;
        }
        done = true;

        deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
