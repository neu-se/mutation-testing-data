  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 1 instead of 0, causing the first element to be skipped in the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = tokens.length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element instead of the first, and the loop condition would be met on the first iteration, causing the loop to only execute once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1;
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the loop condition would always be true, causing the loop to continue indefinitely.

DONE.
