  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is not being checked for strict equality with `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is being applied to the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable, which is not the same as checking for strict equality with `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is being used to check for strict inequality with `false`, which is not the same as checking for strict equality with `false`.

DONE.
