  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in reversed order of latitudes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1.longitude + point2.longitude)/2
```
This would result in an unexpected bias in the direction of the calculated point. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1.longitude - point2.longitude) * Math.cos(point1.latitude + point2.latitude)
```
This would result in an unexpected bias in the direction of the calculated point.

DONE.
