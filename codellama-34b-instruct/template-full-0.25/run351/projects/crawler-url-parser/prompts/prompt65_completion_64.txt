  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `hostname` is a property of the `URL` object that contains the hostname of the URL, whereas `host` is a property that contains the entire host string, including the port number if it is present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.port
```
This would result in different behavior because `port` is a property of the `URL` object that contains the port number of the URL, whereas `host` is a property that contains the entire host string, including the port number if it is present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pathname` is a property of the `URL` object that contains the pathname of the URL, whereas `host` is a property that contains the entire host string, including the port number if it is present.

DONE.
