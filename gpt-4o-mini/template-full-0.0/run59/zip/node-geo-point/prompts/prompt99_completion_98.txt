Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + x
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from a difference to a sum, which would lead to incorrect longitude calculations for the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y - x
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the relationship between the two variables, potentially leading to incorrect longitude values that do not accurately reflect the intended destination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the x value by 2, which would distort the longitude calculation and yield an incorrect destination point that is not proportional to the original bearing.

DONE.
