  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `cb` function is called with `undefined` as the first argument, it will consider it as a completed stream, while the original code fragment `null` will be treated as an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `cb` function is called with `NaN` as the first argument, it will consider it as a completed stream, while the original code fragment `null` will be treated as an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `cb` function is called with an empty string as the first argument, it will consider it as a completed stream, while the original code fragment `null` will be treated as an error.

DONE.
