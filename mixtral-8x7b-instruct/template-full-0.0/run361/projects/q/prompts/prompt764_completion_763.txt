 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.resolve()` creates a resolved promise, which is not the same as the original `when` function that handles the promise states (fulfilled, rejected, or progressing).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Function()
