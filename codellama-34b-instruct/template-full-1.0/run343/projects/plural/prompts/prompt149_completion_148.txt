  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality without considering type, so it would return `true` if `String.prototype.plural` is `undefined`, but not if it is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality considering type, so it would return `false` if `String.prototype.plural` is `undefined`, but not if it is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof String.prototype.plural !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks for the type of the variable, so it would return `true` if `String.prototype.plural` is `undefined`, but not if it is `null`.

DONE.
