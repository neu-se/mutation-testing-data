Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = reject("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting with the original exception, it rejects with a generic string message, which may not provide useful information about the actual error that occurred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = reject(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with a `null` value instead of the actual exception, which could lead to confusion as the reason for rejection would be unclear.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = reject(new Error("Custom error message"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it always rejects with a new error containing a fixed message, regardless of the actual exception that was thrown, thus losing the context of the original error.

DONE.
