  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `Math.min` function to return a different value, potentially resulting in a different number of iterations in the `while` loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `Math.min` function to return a different value, potentially resulting in a different number of iterations in the `while` loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.random()` function would introduce randomness into the outcome of the `Math.min` function, potentially resulting in a different number of iterations in the `while` loop.

DONE.
