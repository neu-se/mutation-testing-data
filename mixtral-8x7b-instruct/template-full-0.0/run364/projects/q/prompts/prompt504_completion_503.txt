 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `apply` method on the `value` object, bypassing any potential custom behavior defined in the `Promise` prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `apply` method from the `Function` prototype, which may not have the desired effect when working with custom promise objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `apply` method with the `Math.max` function, which would cause a runtime error when trying to execute the `post` method with the given arguments.

DONE.
