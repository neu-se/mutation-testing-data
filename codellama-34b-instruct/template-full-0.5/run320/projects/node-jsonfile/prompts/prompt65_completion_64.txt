  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is missing, which would cause the replacement to occur only once, rather than globally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/gi, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which would cause the replacement to be case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because a space is added to the replacement string, which would cause the replacement to insert a space character instead of removing the BOM.

DONE.
