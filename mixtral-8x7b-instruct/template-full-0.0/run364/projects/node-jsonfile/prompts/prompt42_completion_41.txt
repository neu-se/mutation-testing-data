 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the built-in `JSON.stringify` instead of the imported `stringify` function from the `utils` module. This might cause issues if the `stringify` function in the `utils` module has any custom behavior or additional features not present in the built-in version.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj => obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to convert the object to a string using the `toString()` method, which is not equivalent to calling `stringify` with the default options. This would likely result in incorrect serialization of the input object, especially for complex data structures or objects with custom `toString()` implementations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => '{}'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an empty object as a string, regardless of the input. This would cause data loss and
