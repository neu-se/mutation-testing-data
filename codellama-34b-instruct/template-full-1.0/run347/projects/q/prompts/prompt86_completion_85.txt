  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call.call` is a different method that does not have the same functionality as `call.apply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
apply.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply.call` is a different method that does not have the same functionality as `call.apply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    // code to trigger an error or exception
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function would cause an error or exception to be thrown, which would not occur with `call.apply`.

DONE.
