  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be attempting to add 1 and 1, which would result in the value 2, rather than capturing the current line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be attempting to concatenate the string "hello world" with the current line number, which would result in a string value, rather than capturing the current line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be attempting to capture the current line number, but null is not a valid value for this purpose.

DONE.
