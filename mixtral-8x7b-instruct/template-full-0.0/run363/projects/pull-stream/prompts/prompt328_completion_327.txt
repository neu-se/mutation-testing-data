 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would only be called if `end` is exactly equal to `true`, rather than just truthy. This could cause the stream to behave unexpectedly if `end` is a non-empty string or non-zero number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
