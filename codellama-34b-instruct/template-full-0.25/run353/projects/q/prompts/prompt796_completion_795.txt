  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, void 0, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progress notification to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, void 0, function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progress notification to be called with an empty function, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, void 0, function (reason) {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progress notification to be called with a function that takes a reason argument, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

DONE.
