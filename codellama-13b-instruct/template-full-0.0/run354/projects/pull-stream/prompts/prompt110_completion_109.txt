  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the test to fail if the expected result is not equal to the actual result + 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would be decremented by 1, which could cause the test to fail if the expected result is not equal to the actual result - 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the test to fail if the expected result is not equal to the actual result * 2.

DONE.
