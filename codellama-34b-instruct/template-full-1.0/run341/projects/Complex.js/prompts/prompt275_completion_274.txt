  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` will return the cosine of an angle instead of the sine, which could lead to errors in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the complement of the sine value instead of the sine value itself, which could lead to errors in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the negated sine value instead of the sine value itself, which could lead to errors in the application.

DONE.
