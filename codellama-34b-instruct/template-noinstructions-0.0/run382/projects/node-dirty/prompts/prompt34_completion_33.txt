  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rm` method would not call the `set` method with a callback function, which would cause the `drain` event to not be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rm` method would call the `set` method with an empty callback function, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted immediately, rather than when the data is persisted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('Test error') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rm` method would call the `set` method with a callback function that throws an error, which would cause the `drain` event to not be emitted.

DONE.
