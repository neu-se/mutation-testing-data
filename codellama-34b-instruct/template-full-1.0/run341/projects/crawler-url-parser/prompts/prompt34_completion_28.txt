  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the baseUrlStr parameter is now set to 1, which is not a valid URL. This would cause the parse function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the parse method would now be called with a third argument of `false`, which would prevent the module from removing the hash from the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the baseUrlStr parameter is now set to 'https://', which is not a valid URL. This would cause the parse function to throw an error.

DONE.
