  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the `longitude` property of the `object` argument instead of the `latitude` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the `latitude` property of the `object` argument instead of the `longitude` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the `longitude` property of the `object` argument instead of the `latitude` property.

DONE.
