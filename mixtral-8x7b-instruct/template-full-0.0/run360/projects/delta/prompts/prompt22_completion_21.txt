 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality instead of using the `isEqual` function, which can handle nested objects and various types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.stringify(a[key]) === JSON.stringify(b[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for stringified equality, which would not correctly compare nested objects or handle cases with different object structures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a[key]?.toString() === b[key]?.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts both values to strings and checks for equality, which would not correctly compare nested objects or handle cases with different object structures or non-object types.

DONE.
