  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `res['im']` is less than or equal to 0, while the modified code fragment checks if `res['im']` is strictly less than 0. This could potentially cause the test to fail if the value of `res['im']` is exactly 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `res['im']` is less than or equal to 0, while the modified code fragment checks if `res['im']` is strictly greater than 0. This could potentially cause the test to fail if the value of `res['im']` is exactly 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `res['im']`
