  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(operands)
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands` is a variable that contains the list of arguments passed to `promiseDispatch`, while `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the actual arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `operands` array, while `array_slice(operands)` creates a deep copy of it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands.map(function (operand) { return operand; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands.map()` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the `operands` array, while `array_slice(operands)` creates a new array with the same elements as the `operands` array.
