  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be incremented by 1, which could affect the result of the `indexOf` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be decremented by 1, which could affect the result of the `indexOf` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` and `end` variables would be added together, which could affect the result of the `indexOf` method.

DONE.
