  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would not be executed, even if the condition is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because `10` is a truthy value, so the `if` statement would be executed even if the condition is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, promise) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the index of `promise` in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would cause the `splice` method to remove the wrong element.

DONE.
