 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the condition, causing the code block to execute when the `otherIter` is not at an 'insert' operation, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.current() === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `otherIter` is at the end of its iterable, instead of checking the type of the next operation. This would cause the code block to not execute when there are no more operations in the `otherIter`, even if the type of the last operation was 'insert'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peekType() === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the next type in the `otherIter` is `null`, which is never the case, since the `peek
