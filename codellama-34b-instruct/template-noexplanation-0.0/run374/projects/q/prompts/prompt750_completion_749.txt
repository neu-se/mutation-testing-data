  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This change will cause the `onRejected` function to be called even if there are no pending promises, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This change will cause the `onRejected` function to be called only if there are pending promises, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This change will cause the `onRejected` function to be called only if all promises have been rejected, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
