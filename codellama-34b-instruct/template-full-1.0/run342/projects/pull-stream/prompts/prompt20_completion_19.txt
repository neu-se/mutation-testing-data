  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations and potentially cause the expression to evaluate to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the operation being performed and potentially cause the expression to evaluate to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read || ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logic of the expression and potentially cause the program to take a different execution path.

DONE.
