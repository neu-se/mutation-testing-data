  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, undefined, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` instead of calling the `callback` function with `result` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, null, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` instead of calling the `callback` function with `result` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, function() {}, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function would be called instead of the original `callback` function, and it would not have access to the `result` variable.

DONE.
