  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.match(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace

This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `replace`, which replaces the first occurrence of the regular expression in the string, while the new code uses `match`, which returns an array of all matches in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/).join('/').replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `replace`, which replaces the
