  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`callback.apply(flipped, farguments)`
This would result in different behavior because `flipped` would be undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`callback.apply(farguments, flipped)`
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `callback` would be in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`callback.apply(this, farguments)`
This would result in different behavior because the value of `this` would be different.

DONE.
