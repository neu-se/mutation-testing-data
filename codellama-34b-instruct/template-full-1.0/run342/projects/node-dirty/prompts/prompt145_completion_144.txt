  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` would print the string `'drain'` to the console, whereas the original code would emit an event with the same name using the `this.emit` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas the original code would emit an event with the same name using the `this.emit` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('drain'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would emit an event with the name `'drain'`, whereas the buggy code would emit an event with the name `'error'` and a `new Error` object as the second argument.

DONE.
