  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid object reference, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid object reference, but it does not have any properties or methods, so the `dispatch` method would not be able to find the `apply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object does not have any properties or methods, so the `dispatch` method would not be able to find the `apply` method.

DONE.
