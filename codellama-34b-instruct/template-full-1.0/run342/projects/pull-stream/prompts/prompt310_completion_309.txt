  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` even if `test` returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is now being called with the wrong number of arguments (it expects 1 argument, but is being passed 2). This would cause an error to be thrown, which would terminate the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is now being called with the wrong number of arguments (it expects 1 argument, but is being passed 2). This would cause an error to be thrown, which would terminate the program.

DONE.
