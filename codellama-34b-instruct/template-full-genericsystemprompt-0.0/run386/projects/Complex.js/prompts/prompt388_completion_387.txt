  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosh of the imaginary part of the complex number, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
