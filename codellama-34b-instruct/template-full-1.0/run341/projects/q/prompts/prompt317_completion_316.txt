  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create(null)` creates a new object with a null prototype, whereas `object_create` creates a new object with a prototype that is a copy of the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(null)` creates a new object with a null prototype, whereas `object_create` creates a new object with a prototype that is a copy of the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(Object.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(Object.prototype)` creates a new object with a prototype that is the same as the prototype of the original object, whereas `object_create` creates a new object with a prototype that is a copy of the original object.

DONE.
