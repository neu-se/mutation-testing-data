  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calculating the cosine of `b`, while the replaced code fragment is calculating the negative cosine of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calculating the cosine of `b`, while the replaced code fragment is calculating the cosine of `b + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calculating the cosine of `b`, while the replaced code fragment is calculating the sine of `b`.

DONE.
