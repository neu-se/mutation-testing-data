  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` variable could have a different value, leading to a different fulfilled value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` variable would be undefined, leading to an error being thrown instead of the original value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` variable would be a string, leading to a different fulfilled value being returned.

DONE.
