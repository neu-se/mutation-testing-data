  The given code fragment is from a JavaScript library for complex number arithmetic. The method `Complex#pow` calculates the power of two complex numbers. The `PLACEHOLDER` is the code fragment that calculates the complex square root.

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex square root calculation is incorrect, and the result would be a complex number instead of a real number.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex square root calculation is incorrect, and the result would be a complex number instead of a real number.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex square root calculation is incorrect, and the result would be a complex number instead of a real number.

DONE.
