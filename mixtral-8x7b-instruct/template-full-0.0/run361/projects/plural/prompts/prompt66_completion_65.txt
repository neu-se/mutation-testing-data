 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'memos' => 'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected plural form of 'memo' to 'memos', which may cause tests to fail when checking for the correct plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'o') }
