  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the current operation, and subtracting 1 from it would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the current operation, and adding 1 to it would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index].length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` array contains the operations, and the `length` property of an operation object returns the length of the operation, which may be different from the length of the current operation.

DONE.
