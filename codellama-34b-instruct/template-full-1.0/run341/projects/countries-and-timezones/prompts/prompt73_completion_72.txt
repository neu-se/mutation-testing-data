  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking the type of the `buildTimezone` function's argument, but if it is `null`, the function will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would also result in different behavior because the original code is checking the type of the `buildTimezone` function's argument, but if it is `undefined`, the function will return `undefined`, which is not the same as returning `null` or an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking the type of the `buildTimezone` function's argument, but if it is an empty object, the function will return the same object, which may not be the same as the desired behavior.

DONE.
