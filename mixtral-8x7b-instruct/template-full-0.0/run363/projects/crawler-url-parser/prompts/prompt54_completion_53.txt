 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the absolute URL with a fixed string, which may not match the original URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the absolute URL with a random number, which is unlikely to match any valid URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the absolute URL with null, which would cause an error in the subsequent code that tries to access its properties.

DONE.
