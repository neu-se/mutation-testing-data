 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of a new Op object, which may not have the same properties or methods as the original newOp.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets newOp to null, which would cause an error in the following line when trying to access the `retain` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it reuses the last operation from the current iterator instead of creating a new operation. This could lead to incorrect behavior in the rest of the function, especially if the current operation is not an insert or retain operation.

DONE.
