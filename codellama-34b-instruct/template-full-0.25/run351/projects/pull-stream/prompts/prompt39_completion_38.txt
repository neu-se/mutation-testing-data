  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.pop` would return the last element of the array, whereas `ref.unshift` would return the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.shift` would return the first element of the array, whereas `ref.unshift` would return the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements except the first, whereas `ref.unshift` would return the first element.

DONE.
