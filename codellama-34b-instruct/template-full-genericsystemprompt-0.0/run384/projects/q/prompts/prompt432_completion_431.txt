  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the state of the promise instead of the state of the promise's resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the state of the promise instead of the state of the promise's resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the state of the promise instead of the state of the promise's resolution.

DONE.
