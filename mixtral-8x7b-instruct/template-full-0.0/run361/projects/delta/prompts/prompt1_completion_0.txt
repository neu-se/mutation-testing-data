 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is an empty object instead of checking if `a` is not an object. This could cause the function to behave unexpectedly when `a` is a non-object value like a number, string, or boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is exactly `null` instead of checking if `a` is not an object. This could cause the function to not clear the `a` object when it should, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof a !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is not a function instead of checking if `a` is not an object. This could cause the function to not clear the `a` object when
