  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `inspected` object has a property called `state` with a value of `"rejected"`, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `inspected` object does not have a property called `state` with a value of `"rejected"`, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `inspected` object has a property called `state` with a value of `"pending"`, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
