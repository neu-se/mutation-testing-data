  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property is not defined for the `baseUrlStr` variable, which is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is a string, and does not have a `protocol` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid protocol, and would cause the `gettype` function to throw an error.

DONE.
