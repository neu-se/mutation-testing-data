  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function that returns a promise, while `1` is a number and not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function that returns a promise, while `"Q"` is a string and not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function that returns a promise, while `null` is a null value and not a function.

DONE.
