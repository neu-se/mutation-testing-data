  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) && content.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `content` is a buffer, while this new code fragment also checks if the length of `content` is greater than 0. If `content` is not a buffer, the original code fragment would return `false`, while this new code fragment would return `true` if `content` is not a buffer but has a length greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `content` is a buffer, while this new code fragment checks if `content` is not a buffer. If `content` is a buffer, the original code fragment would return `true`, while this new code fragment would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof content !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior
