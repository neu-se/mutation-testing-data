 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options instanceOf String
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options` is an instance of the built-in `String` object, rather than checking if it is a string primitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof options
