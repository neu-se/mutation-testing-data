  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(process.domain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `onUnhandledError` function to a different context, potentially causing it to have different behavior when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `onUnhandledError` function to a different context, potentially causing it to have different behavior when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(Q.nextTick(process.domain))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `onUnhandledError` function to a different context, potentially causing it to have different behavior when called.

DONE.
