 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._queue` object is an instance of `Map`, and it uses the `size` property to check if it's empty. Using `length` would not work as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'size' in this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `size` property exists in the `this._queue` object, rather than checking if the `Map` is empty. This would always return true, since `Map` objects always have a `size` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(this._queue).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of the keys in the `this._queue` object, rather than checking if the `Map` is empty. This would not work as expected, since `Map` objects do not
