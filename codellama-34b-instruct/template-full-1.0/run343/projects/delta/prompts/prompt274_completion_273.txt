  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked operation is not an insert, but this replacement would check if it is a delete operation, which could lead to different results in the `eachLine` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked operation is not an insert, but this replacement would check if the length of the peeked operation is equal to zero, which could lead to different results in the `eachLine` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked operation is not an insert, but this replacement would check if it is a retain operation, which could lead to different results in the `eachLine`
