  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.path` is a different property than `ctx`, and it may not be defined in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.verb` is a different property than `ctx`, and it may not be defined in the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.query(path, verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.query(path, verb)` is a different method than `ctx`, and it may not be defined in the same way.

DONE.
