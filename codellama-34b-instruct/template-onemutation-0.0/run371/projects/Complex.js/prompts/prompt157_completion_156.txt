  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` and `z` are both zero, while the replaced code fragment checks if `this` is zero and `z` is not zero. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['NAN']` in cases where the original code would return `Complex['ZERO']`.
