  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to skip every other promise in the array, potentially causing the application to fail to function as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to refer to the previous promise in the array instead of the current one, which could cause the application to resolve the wrong promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(identity)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to create a new promise that resolves to the current promise in the array, effectively delaying the resolution of the promise by one tick. This could cause the application to function differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
