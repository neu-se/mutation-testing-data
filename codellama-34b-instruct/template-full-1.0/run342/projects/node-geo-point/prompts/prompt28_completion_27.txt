  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(point2Rad)` would return the sine of `point2Rad`, which is a number between -1 and 1. However, `deg2rad(point2.latitude)` is expected to return a value in radians, which is a measure of the angle between the vector from the center of the circle to the point and the positive x-axis, rather than a number between -1 and 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(point2Rad)` would return the cosine of `point2Rad`, which is a number between -1 and 1. However, `deg2rad(point2.latitude)` is expected to return a value in radians, which is a measure of the angle between the vector from the center of the circle to the point and the positive x-axis, rather than a number between -1 and 1.
