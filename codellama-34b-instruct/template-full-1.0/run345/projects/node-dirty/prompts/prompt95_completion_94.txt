  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr + rowStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to parse an invalid JSON string, causing a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to parse a JSON string with uppercase letters, which is not valid JSON.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(rowStr.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to parse a JSON string that is missing the first character, which would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
