  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the path on "/" characters, but this replacement code fragment splits the path on every character, which would produce a different array of path components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the path on "/" characters, but this replacement code fragment splits the path on every character, which would produce a different array of path components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the path on "/" characters, but this replacement code fragment splits the path on spaces, which would produce a different array of path components.

DONE.
