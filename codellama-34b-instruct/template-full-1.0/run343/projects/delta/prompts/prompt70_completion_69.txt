  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because if the number of keys in the `attributes` object is greater than 1, the program would execute a different code path, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.hasOwnProperty('length')
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `attributes` object has a property called `length`, the program would execute a different code path, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof attributes === 'object' && attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `attributes` object is not an `object` or is null, the program would execute a different code path, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or errors.

DONE.
