Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === null || longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the values are `null`, allowing other non-number types (like strings or objects) to pass through without throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < 0 && longitude < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if both latitude and longitude are negative, which would allow valid positive values to pass without error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof latitude === 'string' || typeof longitude === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either latitude or longitude is a string, which would allow numeric values (including valid numbers) to pass through without throwing an error.

DONE.
