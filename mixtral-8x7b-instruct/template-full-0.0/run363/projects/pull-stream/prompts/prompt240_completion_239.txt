 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would receive `null` as the first argument instead of the expected `end` value, potentially causing issues if the callback is not equipped to handle this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would receive the `data` value as the first argument instead of the expected `end` value. This could cause issues if the callback is not designed to handle this unexpected input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed as the first argument to the `cb` function instead of the expected `end` value. This could cause issues if the callback is not designed to handle this unexpected input.

By introducing these changes, the test suite should fail, highlighting potential weaknesses in the current tests and providing a starting point for improvement. DONE
