  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, and the new code fragment `str.toUpperCase()` is a string with all characters in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, and the new code fragment `str.slice(1)` is a string with the first character removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, and the new code fragment `str.split('').reverse().join('')` is a string with the characters in reverse order.

DONE.
