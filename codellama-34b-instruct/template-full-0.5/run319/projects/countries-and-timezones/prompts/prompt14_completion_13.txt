  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the current timezone to the `current` array, regardless of whether it has been added before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the current timezone to the `all` array, regardless of whether it has been added before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [id], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the current timezone to the `current` array, regardless of whether it has been added before, and it would never add it to the `all` array.

DONE.
