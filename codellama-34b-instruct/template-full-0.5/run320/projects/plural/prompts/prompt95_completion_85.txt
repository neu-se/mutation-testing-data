  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed, causing the regular expression to be case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, causing the regular expression to be global.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, causing the regular expression to be case-insensitive.

DONE.
