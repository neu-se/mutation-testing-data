 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'-1'.slice(8, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an empty string instead of 'Object', which is the expected output of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1 >>> 0
