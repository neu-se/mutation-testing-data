  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a different operation than "delete", and would cause the promise to be resolved with the new value instead of being deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a different operation than "delete", and would cause the promise to be resolved with the current value of the property instead of being deleted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because "post" is a different operation than "delete", and would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the method call instead of being deleted.

DONE.
