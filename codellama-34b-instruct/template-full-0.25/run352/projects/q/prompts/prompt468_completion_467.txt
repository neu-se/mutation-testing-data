  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the string "rejectionHandled", resulting in a different event name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled" + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "rejectionHandled" with the string "1", resulting in a different event name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled" + "1" + "2"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "rejectionHandled" with the string "1" and the string "2", resulting in a different event name.

DONE.
