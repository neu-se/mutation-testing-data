  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `pull` function is now `ref[1]` instead of `ref[0]`. This could cause the function to behave differently if the second argument is not the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `pull` function is now `ref[2]` instead of `ref[0]`. This could cause the function to behave differently if the third argument is not the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument of the `pull` function is now `ref[3]` instead of `ref[0]`. This could cause the function to behave differently if the fourth argument is not the expected value.

DONE.
