  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would start from the first character instead of the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would start from the last character instead of the second character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would start from the second character instead of the last character.

DONE.
