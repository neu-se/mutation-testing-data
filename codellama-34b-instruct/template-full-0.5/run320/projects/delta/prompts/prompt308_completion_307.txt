  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('eachLine() called with non-function predicate');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue executing the loop, while the modified code would throw an error and stop execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue executing the loop, while the modified code would return false and stop execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !predicate(line, {}, i);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue executing the loop, while the modified code would return the negation of the predicate result and stop execution.

DONE.
