  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['EPSILON'] === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would always return `true` if `Complex['EPSILON']` is 0, even if the complex number is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(a) < Complex['EPSILON'] && Math.abs(b) < Complex['EPSILON'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would pass if either `a` or `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, even if the other is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(a) <= Complex['EPSILON'] || Math.abs(b) <= Complex['EPSILON'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would pass if either `a` or `b` is less than or equal to `Comple
