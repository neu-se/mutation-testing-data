 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => task()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function expression, which may have a different context or closure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
task.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context (this) of the task function to null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval(task)
```
This would result in different behavior because it executes the task as a string using the eval function, which can have security and performance implications.

DONE.
