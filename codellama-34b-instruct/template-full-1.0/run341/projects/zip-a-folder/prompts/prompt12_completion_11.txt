  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.exist
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.exist` only checks whether the file or directory exists, but does not check whether it is readable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.readable
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.readable` checks whether the file or directory is readable, but does not check whether it exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.writable
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.writable` checks whether the file or directory is writable, but does not check whether it exists or is readable.

DONE.
