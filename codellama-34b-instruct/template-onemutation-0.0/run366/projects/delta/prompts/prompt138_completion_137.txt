  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked length is less than or equal to `firstLeft`, while the modified code fragment checks if it is greater than or equal to `firstLeft`. This would cause the loop to iterate more times, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.
