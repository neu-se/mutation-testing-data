 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.next(<PLACEHOLDER> + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first character of the insert operation, causing a potential mismatch in the resulting delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.next(<PLACEHOLDER> * 2);
