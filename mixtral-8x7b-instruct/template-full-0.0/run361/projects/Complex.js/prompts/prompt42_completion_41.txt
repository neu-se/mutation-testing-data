 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the operands for the addition is changed, which may produce a different result due to floating point precision errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) * Math.abs(a) + Math.abs(b) * Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the absolute values of `a` and `b` are used, which may produce a different result if either `a` or `b` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + b * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because a constant `1` is added to the expression, which may produce a different result due to floating point precision errors.

DONE.
