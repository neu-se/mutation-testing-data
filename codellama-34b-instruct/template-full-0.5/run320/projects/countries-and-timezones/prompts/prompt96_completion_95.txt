  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` does not return a new array, while `map` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(v => v.name === tzName)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that match the provided condition, while `map` returns a new array with the same number of elements as the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce((acc, v) => acc.concat(v.name === tzName ? [v] : []), [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a new array with only the elements that match the provided condition, while `map` returns a new array with the same number of elements as the original array.

DONE.
