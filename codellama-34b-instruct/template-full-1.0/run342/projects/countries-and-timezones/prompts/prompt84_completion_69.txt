  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the id of the country, rather than the country object itself, which the original code expects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the country, rather than the country object itself, which the original code expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c[Math.random()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random property of the country object, which the original code does not expect.

DONE.
