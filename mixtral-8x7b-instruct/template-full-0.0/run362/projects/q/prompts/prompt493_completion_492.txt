 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false

```javascript

This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be rejected with a new error object, instead of the original `reason`. This could potentially hide the actual error that occurred during the execution of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
