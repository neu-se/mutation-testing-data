  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the policy name to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `get()` method to return a different policy object, depending on whether the policy name is case-sensitive or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the policy name to uppercase, which could potentially cause the `get()` method to return a different policy object, depending on whether the policy name is case-sensitive or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the policy name with the string 'foo', which could potentially cause the `get()` method to return a different policy object, depending on whether the policy name is case-sensitive or not
