  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator changes to `2` instead of `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator changes to `3` instead of `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
4
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator changes to `4` instead of `1`.

DONE.
