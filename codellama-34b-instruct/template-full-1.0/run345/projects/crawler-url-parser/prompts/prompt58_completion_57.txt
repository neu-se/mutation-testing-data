  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
	false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value would be changed to `false`, which means that the `if` statement would be skipped entirely, even if the `linkurl.host` value matches the `pageurl.host` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
	linkurl_subdomain_len === pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl_subdomain_len` value would be used instead of the `linkurl_path` and `pageurl_path` values, which could lead to different URL matching behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
	(linkurl_path.split("/").pop() === pageurl_path.split("/").pop())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl_path` and `pageurl_path` values would be used instead of the `linkurl_subdomain_len` value, which
