  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected` object is not defined in the code snippet, and the `inspect` function is not called. Therefore, the `inspected.state` property would be undefined, and the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected` object is not defined in the code snippet, and the `inspect` function is not called. Therefore, the `inspected.state` property would be undefined, and the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected` object is not defined in the code snippet, and the `inspect` function is not called. Therefore, the `inspected.state
