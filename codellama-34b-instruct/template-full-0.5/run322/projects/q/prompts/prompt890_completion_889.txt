  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `nfapply` is not defined in the `Q` object, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is not defined in the `args` object, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver()))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method is not defined in the `args` object, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
