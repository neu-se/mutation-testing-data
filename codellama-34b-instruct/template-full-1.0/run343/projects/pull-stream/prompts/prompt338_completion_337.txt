  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would uppercase the field value before using it as a key for the `seen` object, which would cause it to behave differently for fields that have different casing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the field value as the key for the `seen` object, rather than the field value itself. This could cause the filter to return different results for fields that have the same length but different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lowercase the field value before using it as a key for the `seen` object, which would cause it to behave differently for fields that have different casing.

DONE.
