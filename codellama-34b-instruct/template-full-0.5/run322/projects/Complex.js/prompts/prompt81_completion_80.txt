  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'-'`, while this replacement checks if `c` is not equal to `'-'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'-'`, while this replacement checks if `c` is equal to `'+'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'-'`, while this replacement checks if `c` is equal to `'I'`.

DONE.
