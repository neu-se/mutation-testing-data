 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the original word without any changes, since the substr method would be called with an argument of 0, which means it will return an empty string as the new substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the original word without any changes, since the substr method would be called with a negative argument, which is not a valid argument and would return the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an "IndexSizeError" exception, since the substr method would be called with an argument that is greater than the length of the string.

DONE.
