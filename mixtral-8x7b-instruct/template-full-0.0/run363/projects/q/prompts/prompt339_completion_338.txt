 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the promise is either "pending" or "rejected", while this change checks for "fulfilled" state. This might cause the promise to be resolved prematurely or incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inspected.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the entire `inspected` object, which contains both the state and the value. This change would only check the `value` property, potentially causing issues when the promise is still pending or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the promise is either "pending" or "rejected", while this change checks only for the "pending" state. This might cause the promise to be resolved or rejected prematurely.
