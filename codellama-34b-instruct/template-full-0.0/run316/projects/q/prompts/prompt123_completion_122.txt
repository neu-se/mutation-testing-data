  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key of object
```
This would result in different behavior because `of` is used to iterate over the values of an object, while `in` is used to check if a property exists in an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key: object
```
This would result in different behavior because `:` is used to define a property in an object, while `in` is used to check if a property exists in an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = object
```
This would result in different behavior because `=` is used to assign a value to a variable, while `in` is used to check if a property exists in an object.

DONE.
