  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different argument, which could change the behavior of the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different argument, which could change the behavior of the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different argument, which could change the behavior of the iterator.

DONE.
