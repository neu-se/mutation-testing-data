  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches the end of the string, while the new code fragment matches the start of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the match with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces the match with a single space.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, function(match) { return match.toUpperCase(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the match with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces the match with the uppercase version of the match.

DONE.
