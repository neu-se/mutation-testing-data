  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the `tzs` object, while `tzs` itself is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of values from the `tzs` object, while `tzs` itself is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` returns an array of key-value pairs from the `tzs` object, while `tzs` itself is an object.

DONE.
