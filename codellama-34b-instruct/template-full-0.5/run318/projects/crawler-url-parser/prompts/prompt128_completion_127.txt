  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl` would be `null`, which would cause the function to throw an error when trying to access its `subdomain` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl = "";
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl` would be an empty string, which would cause the function to throw an error when trying to access its `subdomain` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl = "http://example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl` would be a different URL than the one passed to the function, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
