  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<>` operator is used instead of the `*` operator, which would result in a different calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(point, this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the operands is reversed, which would result in a different calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument is added to the function call, which would result in a different calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
