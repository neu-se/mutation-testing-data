 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.hasNext(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always checks for a next element with a fixed argument of 1, instead of checking if there's any next element regardless of its position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() > otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the length of the next elements in both iterators, instead of checking if the other iterator has a next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the next element is an insert and has a positive length, instead of just checking if the next element is an insert.

DONE.
