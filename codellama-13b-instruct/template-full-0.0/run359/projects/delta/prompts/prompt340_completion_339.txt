  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex + 1` expression would be evaluated as `baseIndex + (1 + 1)` instead of `baseIndex + 2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex + 1` expression would be evaluated as `baseIndex - 1` instead of `baseIndex + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex + 1` expression would be evaluated as `baseIndex * 2` instead of `baseIndex + 1`.

DONE.
