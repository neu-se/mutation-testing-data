 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
call.apply(window, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly use the `window` object as the `this` context, which may not be the intended object in certain environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
call.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly use the `null` value as the `this` context, which may cause issues when the method being called relies on accessing properties of the original `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
call.apply(1, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly use a number as the `this` context, which is invalid since `this` should always be an object. This would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
