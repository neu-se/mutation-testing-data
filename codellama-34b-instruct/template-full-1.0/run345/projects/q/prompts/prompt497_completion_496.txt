  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, and therefore does not have a `stack` property, unlike the original `reason` object, which could have a `stack` property if it is an Error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and therefore does not have a `stack` property, unlike the original `reason` object, which could have a `stack` property if it is an Error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('My custom error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the new Error object created by `new Error('My custom error message')` has a `stack` property that is different from the original `reason` object's `stack` property, if it exists.

DONE.
