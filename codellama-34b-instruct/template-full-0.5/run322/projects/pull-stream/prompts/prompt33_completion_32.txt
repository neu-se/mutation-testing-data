  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source
```
This would result in different behavior because `read.source` is a function that returns the source of the `read` stream, whereas `read` is the stream itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source()
```
This would result in different behavior because `read.source()` is a function that returns the source of the `read` stream, whereas `read` is the stream itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source.source()
```
This would result in different behavior because `read.source.source()` is a function that returns the source of the `read` stream, whereas `read` is the stream itself.

DONE.
