  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is negated, which would cause the filter function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is applied to the next element in the array, which would cause the filter function to return a different set of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) && index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is only applied to every other element in the array, which would cause the filter function to return a different set of elements.

DONE.
