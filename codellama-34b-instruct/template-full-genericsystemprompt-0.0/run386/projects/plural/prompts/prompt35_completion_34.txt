  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always return a string that is one character shorter than the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always return a string that is one character longer than the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always return a string that is twice as long as the original string.

DONE.
