Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all([this, that]).then(function (values) { return values[0]; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first value of the array of resolved promises instead of checking if the two promises are equal, potentially leading to incorrect results when the values are not the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(this).then(function (x) { return x; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the current promise and return its value, ignoring the second promise entirely, which means it would not enforce the equality check between `this` and `that`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Different promises"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with a specific error message, rather than checking if the two promises fulfill to the same value, thus bypassing the intended functionality of joining the promises.

DONE.
