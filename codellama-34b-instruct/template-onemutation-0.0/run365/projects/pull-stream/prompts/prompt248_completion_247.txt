  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` was called with `null` as the first argument, while the new code fragment calls `read` with `abort` as the first argument. This could potentially cause the `read` function to behave differently, depending on its implementation.

DONE.
