  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `Q` object instead of invoking the `nodeify` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.nodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the `nodeify` method on the `object` instead of the `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of the result of the `nodeify` method.

DONE.
