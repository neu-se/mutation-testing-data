  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a data object to be passed to the callback, but with `null`, the callback would receive a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a data object to be passed to the callback, but with `undefined`, the callback would receive a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a data object to be passed to the callback, but with an empty object `{}`, the callback would receive a different value.

DONE.
