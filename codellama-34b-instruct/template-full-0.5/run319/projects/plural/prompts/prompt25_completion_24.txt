  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a different method than `substr` and would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a different method than `substr` and would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a different method than `substr` and would return a different result.

DONE.
