  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the peekLength function would return a different value, potentially causing the code to take a different path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because the peekLength function would return a different value, potentially causing the code to take a different path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength, otherIter.peekLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because the peekLength function would return a different value, potentially causing the code to take a different path.

DONE.
