Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed instead of the `callback`, causing the promise to not execute the intended finalization logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would lead to the same error being thrown as when passing an invalid callback, but it would not provide any meaningful error message or context about the failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return "done"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would return a string instead of a promise, which would disrupt the intended chaining of promises and potentially lead to unexpected results in the promise resolution.

DONE.
