  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the array, whereas `splice()` removes the element at the specified index. In this case, the index is `at`, which is the index of the rejection in the `unhandledRejections` array. If the rejection is not the last element in the array, `pop()` would remove the wrong element, leading to incorrect behavior.
