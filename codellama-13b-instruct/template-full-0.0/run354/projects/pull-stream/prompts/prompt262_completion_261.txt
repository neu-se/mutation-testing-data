  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (err)` statement would not be executed, and the code would continue to the next chunk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (err)` statement would not be executed, and the code would continue to the next chunk.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (err)` statement would be executed, and the code would abort the current stream and then stream of streams.

DONE.
