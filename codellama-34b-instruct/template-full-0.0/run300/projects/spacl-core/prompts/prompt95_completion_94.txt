  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would set the value of the map to `null` instead of the `policy` object, which could cause unexpected behavior when querying the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would set the value of the map to the `name` property of the `policy` object, which could cause unexpected behavior when querying the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would set the value of the map to the result of the `query` method, which could cause unexpected behavior when querying the map.

DONE.
