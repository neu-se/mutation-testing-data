  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` variable would be incremented by 1, which would be a different value than the original `progress` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` variable would be multiplied by 2, which would result in a different value than the original `progress` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` variable would be decremented by 1, which would result in a different value than the original `progress` variable.

DONE.
