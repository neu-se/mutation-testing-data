  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `aborted` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `aborted` is `false`, and `false` when `aborted` is `true`. This would cause the `cb(aborted)` call to be skipped when `aborted` is `false`, which would result in a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
