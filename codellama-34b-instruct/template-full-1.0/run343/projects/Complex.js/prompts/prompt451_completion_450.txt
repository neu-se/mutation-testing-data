  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operation changes the resulting value compared to the subtraction operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operation changes the resulting value compared to the subtraction operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the second operand is changed from `this['re']` to `this['im']`, which would result in a different value.

DONE.
