  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!map
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of `map`, meaning that `map` will be falsey when it is originally truthy, and vice versa. This would cause the mutated code to take a different path in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` is now a different object, which could affect the behavior of the `map` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` is now a different function, which could affect the behavior of the `map` function.

DONE.
