  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is now always returning `false`, even when the property exists. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, and the `TypeError` would be thrown even when the object has the expected property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is now always returning `true`, even when the property does not exist. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, and the `TypeError` would not be thrown even when the object does not have the expected property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty = !point.hasOwnProperty;
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is now always returning the opposite of what it would normally return.
