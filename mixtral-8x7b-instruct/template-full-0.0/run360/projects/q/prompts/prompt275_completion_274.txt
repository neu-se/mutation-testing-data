 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
self.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the success callback would be called instead of the error callback when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the makeNodeResolver function would return an empty function, which would not handle the error or resolve/reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Buggy error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with a "Buggy error" message, regardless of the error passed in the nodeback.

DONE.
