  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. In contrast, the new code fragment uses a hardcoded array `[1, 2, 3]`, which is not the same as the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. In contrast, the new code fragment uses a string `"hello"`, which is not the same as the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function.
