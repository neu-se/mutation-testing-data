  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.message` is a string representing the error message, whereas `e` is the error object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack` is a string representing the stack trace at the point where the error was thrown, whereas `e` is the error object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.name` is a string representing the name of the error, whereas `e` is the error object itself.

DONE.
