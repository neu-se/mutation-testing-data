  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `content` variable, which is a buffer, and the resulting string is then passed to `JSON.parse()`. This would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error if the buffer contains invalid JSON data, whereas the original code would not throw an error in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `content` variable with the `'utf8'` encoding, which is a string, and the resulting string is then passed to `JSON.parse()`. This would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error if the string contains invalid JSON data, whereas the original code would not throw an error in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('base64')
```
This would result in different behavior because the
