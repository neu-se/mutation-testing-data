  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a minimum value of 1 for the places parameter, instead of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a maximum value of 0 for the places parameter, instead of the actual value of places.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a value of 0 for the places parameter, regardless of the actual value of places.

DONE.
