  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].match
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a method of the `RegExp` object, while `match` is a method of the `String` object. In this case, `rule[0]` is a `RegExp` object, so using `match` instead of `test` would cause the code to fail.

DONE.
