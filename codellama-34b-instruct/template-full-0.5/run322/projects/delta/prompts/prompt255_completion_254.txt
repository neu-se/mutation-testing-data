  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the +1 would cause the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the -1 would cause the loop to iterate one fewer time, potentially leading to a missed iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the *2 would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times, potentially leading to a performance issue.

DONE.
