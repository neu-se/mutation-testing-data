  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + verb, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate the `path` and `verb` strings, while the new code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate the `path` and `verb` strings and then pass the result as a single argument to the `policy.query()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb + ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `path`, `verb`, and `ctx` arguments separately to the `policy.query()` method, while the new code fragment concatenates the `verb` and `ctx` strings and then passes the result as the second argument to the `policy.query()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx + path
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `path`, `verb`, and `ctx` arguments separately to
