  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `drain` function to receive a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'foo'` is a string, and it would cause the `drain` function to receive a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and it would cause the `drain` function to receive a different argument.

DONE.
