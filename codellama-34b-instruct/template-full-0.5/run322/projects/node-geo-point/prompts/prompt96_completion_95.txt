  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(y, x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` is a function that returns the arctangent of `y / x` in radians, whereas `atan2` is a constant that represents the arctangent of 2 in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(y, x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` is a function that returns the arctangent of `y / x` in radians, whereas `atan2` is a constant that represents the arctangent of 2 in radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` is a function that returns the arctangent of `y` in radians, whereas `atan2` is a constant that represents the arctangent of 2 in rad
