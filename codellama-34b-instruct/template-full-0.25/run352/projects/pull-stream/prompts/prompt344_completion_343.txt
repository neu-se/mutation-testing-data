  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `onAbort` is truthy before calling the `abort` function, while this modified code fragment would call the `abort` function regardless of the value of `onAbort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `onAbort` is truthy before calling the `abort` function, while this modified code fragment would call the `abort` function only if `onAbort` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort ? abort : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `onAbort` is truthy before calling the `abort` function, while this modified code fragment would call the `abort` function only if `onAbort` is truthy, and return `
