  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is not a function and would throw an error when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an instance of `Promise` and would not have a `reject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Promise()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Promise()` creates a new promise that is not equivalent to the original `deferred` object, which was created by calling `defer()`.

DONE.
