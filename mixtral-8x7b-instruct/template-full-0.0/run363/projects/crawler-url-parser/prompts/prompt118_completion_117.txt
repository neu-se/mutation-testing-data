 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.protocol == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the protocol is null instead of checking if it is not truthy. This might pass for cases where the protocol is an empty string, which should not be allowed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.url === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality with null, whereas the original code checks if the url property exists and is not null. This might pass for cases where the url property exists but has a falsy value, such as an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.hasOwnProperty('url')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'url' property exists in the currentUrl object, whereas the original code checks if the url property exists and is not null. This might pass for cases where the 'url' property exists but has a falsy value, such as
