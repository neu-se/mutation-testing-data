 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would return `false` for all inputs, instead of checking if the input is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would always return `true`, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would return `true` for arrays, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
