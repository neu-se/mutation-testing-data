  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function returns a new array by copying a specified portion of an existing array, while the `PLACEHOLDER` was intended to indicate a different fragment of code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`${array_slice.values()}`
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.Values()` returns an array of the slice's string representations, while the `PLACEHOLDER` was intended to indicate a different fragment of code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`++array_slice`
```
This would result in different behavior because `++array_slice` constructs a new string by concatenating the `array_slice` string with itself, while the `PLACEHOLDER` was intended to indicate a different fragment of code.

DONE.
