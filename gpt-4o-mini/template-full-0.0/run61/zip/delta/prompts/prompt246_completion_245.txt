Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of deleting the specified number of operations from `retDelta`, it would incorrectly add `opLength` as a new operation, potentially leading to an incorrect state in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(opLength + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one more operation than intended, which could cause the resulting delta to incorrectly represent the operations that should have been deleted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete twice the number of operations as intended, which could lead to an underflow of operations in `retDelta`, resulting in a loss of data.

DONE.
