  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `===` to check for equality, which checks both the value and the type of the operands. In this case, `plus + minus` is an expression that evaluates to a number, and `0` is a number, so the expression would evaluate to `true` if `plus + minus` is less than or equal to 0, and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `===` to check for equality, which checks both the value and the type of the operands. In this case, `plus + minus` is an expression that evaluates to a number, and `0` is a number, so the expression would evaluate to `true` if `plus + minus` is less than 0, and `false` otherwise.
