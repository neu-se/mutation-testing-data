  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would not be called with the correct key, leading to a potential data loss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would not be called with the correct key, leading to a potential data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '_'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would not be called with the correct key, leading to a potential data loss.

DONE.
