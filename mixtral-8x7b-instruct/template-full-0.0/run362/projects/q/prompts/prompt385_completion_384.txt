 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method would return a promise that is always resolved, regardless of the original promise's state. This could cause issues if the callback passed to `tap` relies on the original promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method would return a promise that is immediately resolved with a value of `null`. This could cause issues if the callback passed to `tap` expects a specific value or type of value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
