  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause the `Q.defer` function to be called immediately and return a resolved promise, rather than returning a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is called on the `Q.defer` function, which would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, rather than waiting for the `put` method to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called on the `Q.defer` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the `put` method to be called.

DONE.
