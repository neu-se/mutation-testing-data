  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `this._waitForDrain`, causing the `break` statement to be executed even if `this._waitForDrain` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the `break` statement would only be executed if `this._waitForDrain` is strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for loose equality, so the `break` statement would be executed if `this._waitForDrain` is loosely equal to `false`, which would include if it is `null`, `undefined`, or any other falsy value.

DONE.
