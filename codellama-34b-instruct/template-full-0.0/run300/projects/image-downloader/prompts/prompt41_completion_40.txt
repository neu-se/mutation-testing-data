  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with the given value, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Timeout Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Timeout Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that logs a message to the console, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given reason.

DONE.
