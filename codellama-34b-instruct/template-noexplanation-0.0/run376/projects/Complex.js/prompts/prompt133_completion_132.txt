  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This change will cause the `sub` method to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] && z['isZero']()
```
This change will cause the `sub` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` if `z` is both infinite and zero, which is a nonsensical result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] || z['isZero']()
```
This change will cause the `sub` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` if `z` is either infinite or zero, which is a nonsensical result.

DONE.
