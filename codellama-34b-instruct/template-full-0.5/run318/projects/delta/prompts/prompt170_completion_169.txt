  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the next operation in the iterator, rather than the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER> + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the next operation in the iterator, rather than the current operation, and it would also cause the function to return a different result if the iterator has a length of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER> * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the next operation in the iterator, rather than the current operation, and it would also cause the function to return a different result if the iterator has a length of 2 or more.

DONE.
