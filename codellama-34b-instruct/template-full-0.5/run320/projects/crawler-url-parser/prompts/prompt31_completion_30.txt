  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex checks for the presence of a protocol at the beginning of the string, while the new regex does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)|[^\w]/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex also checks for the presence of non-word characters at the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)|[^\w]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex also checks for the presence of one or more non-word characters at the beginning of the string.

DONE.
