Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Failed to parse row: ${row}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the variable `row` instead of `rowStr`, which may not provide the correct context of the original string that caused the error, potentially leading to confusion about what data was corrupted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${JSON.stringify(row)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `JSON.stringify(row)` instead of `rowStr`, which may not accurately represent the original string format of the row, leading to misleading error messages.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Row data is invalid: ${rowStr.length}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it reports the length of `rowStr` instead of the content of the row itself, which does not provide useful information about the actual data that caused the error, making debugging more difficult.

DONE.
