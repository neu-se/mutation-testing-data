  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/,'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regular expression to only match URLs ending in ".default", which might lead to incorrect parsing of URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/\.\.\./
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regular expression to only match URLs ending in ".default" and then removes the next two characters, which might lead to incorrect parsing of URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/\.\.\./(\.)default(\.\.\.)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regular expression to only match URLs ending in ".default" and then removes the next two characters, which might lead to incorrect parsing of URLs.

DONE.
