Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = { resolve: function() {}, reject: function() {} };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred` object is not a proper deferred object that can handle promises; it lacks the necessary methods to resolve or reject a promise, leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer().then(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly attempts to chain a `then` method directly on the `defer()` call, which would not return a valid deferred object, causing the promise to not function as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer().resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately resolves the deferred object, which means the promise would be resolved before the function is even called, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the promise chain.

DONE.
