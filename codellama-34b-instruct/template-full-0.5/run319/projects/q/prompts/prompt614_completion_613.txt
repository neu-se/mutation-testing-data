  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will return a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a promise that will be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` will return a resolved promise, whereas `Q` is a promise that will be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` will return a deferred promise, whereas `Q` is a promise that will be resolved.

DONE.
