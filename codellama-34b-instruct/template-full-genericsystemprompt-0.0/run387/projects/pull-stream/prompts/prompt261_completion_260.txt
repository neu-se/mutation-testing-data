  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `err` argument, which would cause the stream to emit an error and terminate. In contrast, the original code fragment `cb` would simply call the `cb` function without any arguments, which would cause the stream to continue processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument, which would cause the stream to emit a chunk of data. In contrast, the original code fragment `cb` would simply call the `cb` function without any arguments, which would cause the stream to continue processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `true` as the first argument and `data
