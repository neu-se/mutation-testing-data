  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator `&&`, which checks if both conditions are true. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||`, which checks if either condition is true. This means that if `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` is truthy, the replacement code fragment will evaluate to `targetFilePath`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && !targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator `&&`, which checks if both conditions are true. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||`, which checks if either condition is true. Additionally, the replacement code fragment negates the condition for `targetFilePath`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
