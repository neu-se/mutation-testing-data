  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the attribute to be copied from `b` to `a` only if it is undefined in `a` and defined in `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would copy the attribute from `b` to `a` only if the values are not equal, regardless of whether they are both defined or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would copy the attribute from `b` to `a` only if the values are equal, regardless of whether they are both defined or not.

DONE.
