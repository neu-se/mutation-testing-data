  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(predicate);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while the original code uses `forEach` which executes a provided function once for each array element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(predicate);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, while the original code uses `forEach` which executes a provided function once for each array element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce(predicate);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value, while the original code uses `forEach` which executes a provided function once for each array
