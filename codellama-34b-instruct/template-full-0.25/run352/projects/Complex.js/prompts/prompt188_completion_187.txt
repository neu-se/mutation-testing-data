  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `re` is the real part. Using `im` instead of `re` would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
