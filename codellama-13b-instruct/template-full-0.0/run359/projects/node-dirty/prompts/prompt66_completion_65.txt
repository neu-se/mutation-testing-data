  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end()` method is called on the write stream, which would cause the stream to be closed and any pending writes to be flushed to the file. This could potentially cause the program to crash if the write stream is not properly closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method is called on the write stream, which would cause the stream to be destroyed and any pending writes to be lost. This could potentially cause the program to crash if the write stream is not properly destroyed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork()` method is called on the write stream, which would cause any pending writes to be buffered and not flushed to the file. This could potentially cause the program to crash if the write stream is not
