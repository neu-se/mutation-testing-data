  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is different from the original `[name, args]` value, which would cause the promise to reject instead of resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument of the `args` array to the `dispatch` method, which would cause it to reject if there are more than one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args[1]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the second argument of the `args` array to the `dispatch` method, which would cause it to reject if there are fewer than two arguments.

DONE.
