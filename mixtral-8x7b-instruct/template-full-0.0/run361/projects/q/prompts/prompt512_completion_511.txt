 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` is the correct global object to use, while `object_keys` is a made-up name that would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.keys` is a method that would throw a `TypeError` when called with an argument that is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.keys
