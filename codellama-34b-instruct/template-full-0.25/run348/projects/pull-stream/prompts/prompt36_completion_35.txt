  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the third argument instead of the second argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the second and third arguments instead of using the second argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the second argument by 2 instead of using the second argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
