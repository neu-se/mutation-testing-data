  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process` is an object and has a `toString` method that returns `"[object process]"`, while this new code fragment checks if `process` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process` is an object and has a `toString` method that returns `"[object process]"`, while this new code fragment checks if `process` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process` is an object and has a `toString` method that returns `"[object process]"`, while this new code fragment checks if `process` is a string.

DONE.
