  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow non-object types to be passed without throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow undefined values to be passed without throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any type of value to be passed without throwing an error.

DONE.
