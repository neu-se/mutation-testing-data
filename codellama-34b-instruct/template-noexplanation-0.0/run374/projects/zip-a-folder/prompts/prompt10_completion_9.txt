  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment because it negates the result of the `isGlob` function, which checks if a string is a glob pattern. By negating the result, the code will enter the `else` block if the string is not a glob pattern, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment because it calls the `isGlob` function with the `src` variable as an argument. This will cause the code to enter the `if` block if the `src` variable is a glob pattern, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes('*')
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment because it checks if the `src` variable includes the `*` character, which is a common pattern in glob patterns
