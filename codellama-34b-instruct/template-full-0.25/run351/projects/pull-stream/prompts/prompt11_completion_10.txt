  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 1 instead of 0, which could cause the first element of the array to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element of the array instead of the first, which could cause the last element to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from a random element of the array instead of the first, which could cause some elements to be skipped or repeated.

DONE.
