  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that always returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q.onerror` is an event listener for unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` is a function for calling a function with the given arguments, whereas `Q.onerror` is an event listener for unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makePromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.makePromise` is a function for creating a new promise, whereas `Q.onerror` is an event listener for unhandled rejections.

DONE.
