  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new string, which may not be the same as the original `pathname` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method returns a new string, which may not be the same as the original `pathname` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method returns a new string with all occurrences of the specified pattern (in this case, a forward slash) replaced with the specified replacement string (in this case, an empty string).

DONE.
