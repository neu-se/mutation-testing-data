  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the second element of the rule array to the word, rather than the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[i][1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the second element of the ith rule array to the word, rather than the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[i][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the first element of the ith rule array to the word, rather than the second element.

DONE.
