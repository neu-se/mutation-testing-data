  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that is created by the JavaScript engine to store the arguments passed to a function. The `arguments` object is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, and it is created when the function is called.

In this case, the `arguments` object is being used to access the second argument passed to the function, which is the `name` parameter.

Option 3: The
