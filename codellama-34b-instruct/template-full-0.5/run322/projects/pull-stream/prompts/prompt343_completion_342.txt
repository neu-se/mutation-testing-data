  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `abort !== true` is a comparison that evaluates to a boolean value. In the original code, the `abort` value is passed directly to the `onAbort` callback, while in the mutated code, the `onAbort` callback receives the result of the comparison, which is a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `abort === false` is a comparison that evaluates to a boolean value. In the original code, the `abort` value is passed directly to the `onAbort` callback, while in the mutated code, the `onAbort` callback receives the result of the comparison, which is a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
