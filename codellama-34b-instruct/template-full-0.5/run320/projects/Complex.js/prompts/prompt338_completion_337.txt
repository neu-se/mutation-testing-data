  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would return a different value, which would affect the calculation of the `Complex` object's `re` and `im` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would return a different value, which would affect the calculation of the `Complex` object's `re` and `im` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would return a different value, which would affect the calculation of the `Complex` object's `re` and `im` properties.

DONE.
