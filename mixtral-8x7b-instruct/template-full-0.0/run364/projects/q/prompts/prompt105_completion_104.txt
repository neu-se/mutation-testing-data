 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function in the `array_reduce` method would receive `null` as an argument instead of the expected value from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function in the `array_reduce` method would receive the current index instead of the value from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Date()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function in the `array_reduce` method would receive a Date object representing the current time, instead of the expected value from the array.

DONE.
