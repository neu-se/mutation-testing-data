  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.protocol` is a different value than `currentUrl`, which could cause the `gettype` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.host` is a different value than `currentUrl`, which could cause the `gettype` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.path` is a different value than `currentUrl`, which could cause the `gettype` function to return a different value.

DONE.
