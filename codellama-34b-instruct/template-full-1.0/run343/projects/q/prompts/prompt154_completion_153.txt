  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + " "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the newline character before the STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR, which could change the formatting of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" " + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a space character before the STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR, which could change the formatting of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the newline characters and space around the STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR, which could change the formatting of the stack trace.

DONE.
