  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(line) || isNodeFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition, meaning that the lines that were previously excluded would now be included in the filter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && !line
```
This would result in different behavior because it would additionally filter out empty lines, which may not be desirable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length > 0 && !isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out empty lines, which may not be desirable.

DONE.
