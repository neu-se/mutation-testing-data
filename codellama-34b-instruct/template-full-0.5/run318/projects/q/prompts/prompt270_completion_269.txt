  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an instance of `Error`, whereas `reason` is an instance of `Error`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the code to behave differently depending on how the error is handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("Different rejection reason")
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection reason would be different, which could cause the code to behave differently depending on how the rejection is handled.

DONE.
