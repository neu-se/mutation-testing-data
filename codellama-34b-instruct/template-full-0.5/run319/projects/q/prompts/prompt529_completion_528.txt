  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(object.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object.value` property is undefined, whereas the original code fragment uses the `inspect` method of the `Q` object to return a promise for the inspection of the `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(object.toString());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method of the `object` would be called, whereas the original code fragment uses the `inspect` method of the `Q` object to return a promise for the inspection of the `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(object.inspect());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method of the `object` would be called again, whereas the original code fragment uses the `inspect` method of the `Q` object to return a promise
