  Sure, I can help you with that.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (abort) { cb(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would not be called if `abort` is not true, unlike the original code which would always call `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (onAbort !== null) { cb(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would not be called if `onAbort` is null, unlike the original code which would call `cb` regardless of the value of `onAbort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (abort === false) { cb(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called if `abort` is false, unlike the original code which would not call `cb` if `abort` is false.

DONE.
