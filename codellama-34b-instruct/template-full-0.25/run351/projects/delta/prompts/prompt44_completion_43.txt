  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `throw` statement to be executed even if `a` is not an object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `throw` statement to be executed even if `a` is null, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object' && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `throw` statement to be executed even if `a` is not an object and not null, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
