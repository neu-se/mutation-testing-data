  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would retain one more character than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would retain one fewer character than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would retain twice as many characters as intended.

DONE.
