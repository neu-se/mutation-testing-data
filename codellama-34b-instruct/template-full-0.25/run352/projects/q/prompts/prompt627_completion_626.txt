  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"setValue"
```
This would result in different behavior because "setValue" is not a valid method for a promise object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a valid method for a promise object, but it would not set the value of the property as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set" + "Value"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the strings "set" and "Value" to form the string "setValue", which is not a valid method for a promise object.

DONE.
