  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the `all` function, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the `all` function, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that is rejected with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the `all` function, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the `delay` function after a delay of 1 second.

DONE.
