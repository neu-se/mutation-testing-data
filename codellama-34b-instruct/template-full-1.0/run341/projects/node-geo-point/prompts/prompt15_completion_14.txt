  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates = [NaN, NaN]
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", and `point.coordinates` would no longer be an array of numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator (`+`) is not defined for arrays, so the code would throw a `TypeError` exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates = [undefined, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a special value in JavaScript that represents an undefined or missing value, and `point.coordinates` would no longer be an array of numbers.

DONE.
