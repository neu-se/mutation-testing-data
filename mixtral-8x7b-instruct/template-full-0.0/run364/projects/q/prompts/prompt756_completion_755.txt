 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function allResolvedBad() {
    return Q.resolve([]);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always resolves to an empty array, ignoring the input promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function allResolvedBad(promises) {
    return Q.all(promises);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Q.all` function instead of the correct `all` function, potentially causing incorrect handling of rejected promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function allResolvedBad(promises) {
    return Q.all(promises).then(function(results) {
        return array_map(results, function(promise) {
            return Q.reject(promise);
        });
    });
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects all resolved promises, which is the opposite of the intended
