Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.id, policy
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `policy.id` instead of `policy.name`, which means the policies would be stored in the map using their IDs as keys instead of their names, potentially leading to incorrect retrieval of policies.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toUpperCase(), policy
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the policy name to uppercase before using it as a key, which would cause case sensitivity issues when retrieving policies, leading to potential mismatches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value of the policy to `null` instead of the actual `policy` object, which would mean that the map would not contain the actual policy instances, rendering the `query` and `matches` methods ineffective.

DONE.
