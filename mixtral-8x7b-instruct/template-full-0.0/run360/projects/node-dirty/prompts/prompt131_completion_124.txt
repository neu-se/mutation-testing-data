 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(this._queue)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the queue object instead of the actual values, potentially causing issues in the `for...of` loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.slice()
