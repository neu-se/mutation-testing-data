  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` has a different output than `Math.cos` for the same input, which would affect the calculation of the complex number's sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` has a different output than `Math.cos` for the same input, which would affect the calculation of the complex number's tangent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` has a different output than `Math.cos` for the same input, which would affect the calculation of the complex number's arccosine.

DONE.
