 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to never terminate, as `otherIter.peekLength()` would always be less than or equal to `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to never execute, as `index` would be less than `end` but `otherIter.peekLength()` would be greater than `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to execute more times than necessary, potentially causing the function to perform more operations than required.

DONE.
