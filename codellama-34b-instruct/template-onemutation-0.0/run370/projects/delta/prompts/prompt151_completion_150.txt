  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `-` operator, which would cause the `firstLeft` value to be added to `firstOther.retain` instead of subtracted. This would result in a different value being passed to the `next()` method, which could potentially cause the `OpIterator` to iterate over a different set of operations.
