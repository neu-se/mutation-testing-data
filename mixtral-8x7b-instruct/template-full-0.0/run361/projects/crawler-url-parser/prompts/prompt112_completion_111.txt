 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let currentUrl = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `currentUrl` as an empty object, while the original code initializes it as `undefined`. This change could potentially cause issues in the code that assumes `currentUrl` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `currentUrl` as `null`, while the original code initializes it as `undefined`. This change could potentially cause issues in the code that assumes `currentUrl` is a string or an object with specific properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let currentUrl = 'https://example.com';
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `currentUrl` with a default value, while the original code leaves it `undefined` until a value is assigned later in the code. This change could potentially cause issues if the code relies
