  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry` and `getTimezone` are different functions with different return values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry` and `getTimezone` are different functions with different return values and parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry` and `getTimezone` are different functions with different return values and parameters. Additionally, the `deprecated` option would cause `getCountry` to return a different value than `getTimezone`.

DONE.
