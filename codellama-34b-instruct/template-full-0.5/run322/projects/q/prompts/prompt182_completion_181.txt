  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the entire stack trace to lowercase, which could cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber()` function to misinterpret the stack trace and return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the stack trace, which could cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber()` function to misinterpret the stack trace and return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.slice(stackLine.length - 1, stackLine.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return only the last character of the stack trace, which could cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber()` function to misinterpret the stack trace and
