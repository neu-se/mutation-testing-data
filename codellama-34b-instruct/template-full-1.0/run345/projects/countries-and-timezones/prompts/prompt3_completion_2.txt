  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-null object, but if it gets null instead, it will return undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an object with properties, but if it gets an empty object instead, it will return undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-numeric value, but if it gets a number instead, it will return undefined.

DONE.
