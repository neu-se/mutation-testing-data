  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var a = 5;
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a new variable that is not used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var b = 5;
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a new variable that is not used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(5);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the value `5` to the console, but the original code does not have any logging statements.

DONE.
