  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the iteration to start from a different position in the `OpIterator`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the iteration to start from a different position in the `OpIterator`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the iteration to start from a different position in the `OpIterator`.

DONE.
