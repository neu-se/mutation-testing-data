  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<a href='http://example.com'>Link</a>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `extract` function to return an array with a single element, which would not occur with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<a href='http://example.com'>Link</a><a href='http://example.com'>Link</a>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `extract` function to return an array with two elements, which would not occur with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<a href='http://example.com'>Link</a><a href='http://example.com'>Link</a><a href='http://example.com'>Link</a>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `extract` function to return an array with three elements, which would not occur with the original code
