  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write_close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, while the `read_close` event is emitted when the read stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs, while the `read_close` and `write_close` events are emitted when the corresponding streams are closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is drained, while the `read_close` and `write_close` events are emitted when the corresponding streams are closed.

DONE.
