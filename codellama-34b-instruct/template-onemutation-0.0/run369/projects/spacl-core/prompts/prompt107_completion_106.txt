  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path` variable as-is, while the mutated code fragment converts the `path` variable to lowercase before using it. This could potentially cause the `query` method to return different results for the same input, depending on whether the `path` variable is case-sensitive or not.
