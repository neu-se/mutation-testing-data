  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` iterator by `opLength` characters, which may not be the same as the length of the current operation in `thisIter`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `thisIter` iterator by `opLength` characters, which may not be the same as the length of the current operation in `otherIter`.

DONE.
