  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is passed to `setTimeout()`, while this replacement code fragment uses `deferred.reject()` to immediately reject the promise with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is passed to `setTimeout()`, while this replacement code fragment uses `deferred.resolve()` to immediately resolve the promise with the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is passed to `setTimeout()`, while this replacement code fragment uses `deferred.notify()` to immediately notify the promise with
