  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)`, which is a string, and the arguments passed to `slice` are different from the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)`, which is a string, and the arguments passed to `slice` are different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)`, which is
