 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stacks.unshift(p.stack.split("\n"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the stack into an array of strings and pushes that array as an element into the `stacks` array, instead of pushing the stack string directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stacks.unshift(p.source);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the source object of the promise into the `stacks` array, instead of pushing the stack string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stacks.push(p.stack);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the stack string to the end of the `stacks` array instead of the beginning, which would change the order of the stack traces in the final error message.

DONE.
