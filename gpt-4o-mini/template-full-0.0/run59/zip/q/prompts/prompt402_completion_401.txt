Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of throwing the rejection reason as an error, it returns the reason as a regular value, which would not trigger the rejection handling mechanism.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { console.log(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs the rejection reason to the console instead of throwing it, meaning the promise would not be rejected and the error would not propagate as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("Custom error message"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a new error with a custom message instead of the original rejection reason, which could lead to confusion about the actual cause of the rejection.

DONE.
