  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a string, whereas `op` is an object with properties `insert` and `retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a number, whereas `op` is an object with properties `insert` and `retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a string, and `op.insert.length` would return the length of the string, whereas `op` is an object with properties `insert` and `retain`.

DONE.
