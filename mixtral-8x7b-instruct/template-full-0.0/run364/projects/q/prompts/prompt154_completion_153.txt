 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" From previous event:\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string now includes a space before "From", changing the appearance of the stack trace separation line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\t\n"
