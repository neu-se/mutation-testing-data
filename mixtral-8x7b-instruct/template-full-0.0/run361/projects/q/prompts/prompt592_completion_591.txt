 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is truthy, so the spread operator would always spread an empty array instead of the actual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, causing the `spread` function to not spread any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a truthy value, but it is not an array of arguments. The `spread` function would treat it as an iterable with one item, which may cause unexpected behavior in the callback function.

DONE.
