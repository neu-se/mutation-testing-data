  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify.call` is a different function than `Q.denodeify.apply`, and it would likely cause the code to fail in unexpected ways.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify.bind` is a different function than `Q.denodeify.apply`, and it would likely cause the code to fail in unexpected ways.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify.bind(null)` is a different function than `Q.denodeify.apply`, and it would likely cause the code to fail in unexpected ways.

DONE.
