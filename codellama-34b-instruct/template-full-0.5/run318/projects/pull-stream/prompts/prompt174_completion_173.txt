  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array.length` to determine the length of the array, while this replacement uses `array.length - 1`, which would result in the last element of the array being skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array[i++]` to iterate over the elements of the array in order, while this replacement uses `array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)]` to select a random element from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array` to determine whether the function should return a value or not, while this replacement uses `null`, which would cause the function to always return `null` regardless of the input.
