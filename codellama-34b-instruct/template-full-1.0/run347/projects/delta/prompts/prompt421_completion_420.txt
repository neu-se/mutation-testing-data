  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the slice would always be 0, causing the function to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the wrong index if the slice was not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the wrong index if the slice was empty.

DONE.
