  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(row.key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the key from the data object, rather than setting it to undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, row.val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key to one more than the original value, rather than setting it to undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key to undefined, rather than setting it to the original value.

DONE.
