  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the negated character class `[^aeiouy]` would match any character that is not `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `y`, or `o`, whereas the original code fragment would only match words that end with `o`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the character class `[aeiouy]` would match any character that is `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`, or `y`, whereas the original code fragment would only match words that end with `o`.
