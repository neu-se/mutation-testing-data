  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would return the input string, "person", without modifying it, while the original pluralization rule for "person" should be "people".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would return the same string, "persons", without modifying it, while the original pluralization rule for "person" should be "people".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'individuals'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would return the same string, "individuals", without modifying it, while the original pluralization rule for "person" should be "people".

DONE.
