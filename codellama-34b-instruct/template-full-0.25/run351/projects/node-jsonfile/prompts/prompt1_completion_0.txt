  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this replacement checks if it is not a string. This could cause the function to behave differently for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this replacement checks if it is an object. This could cause the function to behave differently for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding === 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this replacement checks if the `encoding` property of the `options` object is set to `'utf8'`. This could cause the function to behave differently for certain inputs.

DONE.
