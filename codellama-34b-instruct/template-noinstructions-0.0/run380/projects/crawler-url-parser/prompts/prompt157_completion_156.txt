  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original code fragment, which could cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original code fragment, which could cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "a")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original code fragment, which could cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
