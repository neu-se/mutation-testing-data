  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'foo' to the target file path, which would cause the archive to be written to a different location than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the target file path to uppercase, which could cause the archive to be written to a different location than intended if the file system is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.split('/').reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the path components, which could cause the archive to be written to a different location than intended.

DONE.
