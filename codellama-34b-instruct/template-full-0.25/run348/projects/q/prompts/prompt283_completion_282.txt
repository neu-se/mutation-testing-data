  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `array_slice` function is the end index, not the start index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object does not have a `length` property, and the `array_slice` function expects a positive integer as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not an array and does not have a `1` property.

DONE.
