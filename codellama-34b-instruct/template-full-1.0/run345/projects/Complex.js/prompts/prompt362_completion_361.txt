  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the `sinh` of `a`, which is `sinh(a) * Math.cos(b)`, but the mutated code calculates the negative `sinh` of `a`, which is `-sinh(a) * Math.cos(b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the `sinh` of `a`, which is `sinh(a) * Math.cos(b)`, but the mutated code calculates the `cosh` of `a`, which is `cosh(a) * Math.cos(b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e^a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the `sinh` of `a`, which is `sinh(a) * Math.cos
