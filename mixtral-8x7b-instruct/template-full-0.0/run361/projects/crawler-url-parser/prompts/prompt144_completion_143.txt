 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/index\\.[a-z]+$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash before the dot is escaped, making it a literal dot instead of a regex wildcard.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the global flag `g` is added, causing the regex to match all occurrences instead of stopping at the first match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\.[A-Z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the character class `[a-z]` is changed to `[A-Z]`, making the regex match only uppercase extensions instead of lowercase ones.

DONE.
