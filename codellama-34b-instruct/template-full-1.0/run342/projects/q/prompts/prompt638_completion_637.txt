  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + '_buggy']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access a different object property, which may not exist or have the desired value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access a different array index, which may not exist or have the desired value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{[key: string]: object[key]}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the key-value pairs from the original object, but with a different key name in the new object. This could potentially break code that relies on the specific key names in the object.

DONE.
