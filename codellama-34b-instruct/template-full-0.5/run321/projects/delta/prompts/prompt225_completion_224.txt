  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the strings is reversed, which would cause the diffing algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], cursor + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor is now one character ahead of its original position, which would cause the diffing algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[strings[0], strings[1]], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the strings are now contained in an array, which would cause the diffing algorithm to produce a different output.

DONE.
