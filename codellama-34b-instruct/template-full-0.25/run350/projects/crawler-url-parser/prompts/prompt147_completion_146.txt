  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method with no arguments, which splits the string into an array of substrings using whitespace as the separator. In contrast, the modified code fragment uses the `split` method with a single argument, which splits the string into an array of substrings using the specified separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method with no arguments, which splits the string into an array of substrings using whitespace as the separator. In contrast, the modified code fragment uses the `split` method with an empty string as the separator, which splits the string into an array of single characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("\\")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `
