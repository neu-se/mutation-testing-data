  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `nfapply` function as an array, rather than as individual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `nfapply` function as an array, rather than as individual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `nfapply` function as an array, rather than as individual arguments.

DONE.
