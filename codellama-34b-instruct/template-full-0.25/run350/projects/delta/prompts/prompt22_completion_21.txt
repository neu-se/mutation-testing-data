  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` would negate the result of the `isEqual` function, causing the `diff` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is not a valid function, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!==
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is a different operator than `isEqual`, and would cause the `diff` function to return a different value.

DONE.
