  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'im' in a && 're' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both 'im' and 're' are in the object, while this code fragment only checks if 'im' is in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
're' in a && 'im' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both 'im' and 're' are in the object, while this code fragment only checks if 're' is in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'im' in a || 're' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both 'im' and 're' are in the object, while this code fragment checks if either 'im' or 're' is in the object.

DONE.
