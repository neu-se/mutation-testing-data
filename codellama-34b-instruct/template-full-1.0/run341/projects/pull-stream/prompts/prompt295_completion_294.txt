  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if there is no error, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if there is no error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? false : true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `false` if there is an error, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if there is no error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if there is an error, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if there is no error.

DONE.
