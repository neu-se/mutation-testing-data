  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:12345)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error when it tries to access the `node.js` property of the `Error` object, which does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:12345:6789)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error when it tries to access the `node.js` property of the `Error` object, which does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:12345:6789:101112)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error when it tries to access the `node.js` property of the `Error` object, which does not exist.

DONE.
