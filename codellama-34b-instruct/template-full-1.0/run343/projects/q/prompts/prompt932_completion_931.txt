  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object in this case, rather than the function object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` refers to the global object in a browser context, while `this` refers to the current context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
functionName
```
This would result in different behavior because `functionName` is a function call, while `this` is a reference to the function object.

DONE.
