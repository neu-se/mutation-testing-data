 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a['r']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the division to its reciprocal, causing unexpected results if `a['r']` is zero or negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a['r'])
