  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the sine and cosine functions to have opposite signs as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the squared value of 'a' would cause the sine and cosine functions to have values that are twice as large as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of 'a' would cause the sine and cosine functions to have values that are half as large as the original code.

DONE.
