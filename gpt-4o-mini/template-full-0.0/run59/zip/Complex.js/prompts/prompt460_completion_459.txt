Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the absolute value of `a` is greater than `Complex['EPSILON']`, which would lead to the opposite condition being evaluated, potentially causing incorrect string representations for small real parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is not equal to zero, which would incorrectly treat zero as a non-zero value, affecting the string representation of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['re']) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `this['re']` instead of `a`, which may lead to incorrect evaluations if `a` was intended to represent the real part of the complex number, thus affecting the output string.

DONE.
