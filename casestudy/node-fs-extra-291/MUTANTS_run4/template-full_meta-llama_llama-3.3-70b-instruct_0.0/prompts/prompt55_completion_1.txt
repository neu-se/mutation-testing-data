Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be the target path instead of the current path, potentially causing incorrect file paths to be generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would be used as the replacement string, effectively removing the current path from the file name and potentially causing files to be written to the wrong location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
basePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the base path would be used as the replacement string instead of the current path, potentially causing files to be written to a different location than intended.

DONE.
