  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is not a valid event listener and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.close
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.close` would cause the stream to close, resulting in no output being written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.error` would cause the stream to emit an error event, which would be handled by the `reject` function in the `new Promise` constructor.

DONE.
