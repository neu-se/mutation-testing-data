 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would now only call `onEnd` if `a` is truthy, whereas the original code would call `onEnd` if `a` is falsy and `onEnd` is not already called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would now always call `onEnd`, regardless of the value of `a`, whereas the original code would only call `onEnd` if `a` is falsy and `onEnd` is not already called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would now always call `onEnd`, regardless of the value of `a`, whereas the original code would only call `onEnd` if `a` is falsy and `onEnd` is not already called.
