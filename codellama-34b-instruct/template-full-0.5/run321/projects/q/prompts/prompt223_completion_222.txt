  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function is used to create a new object with the `Promise.prototype` as its prototype, while replacing it with `null` would result in a different object being created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function is used to create a new object with the `Promise.prototype` as its prototype, while replacing it with `undefined` would result in a different object being created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function is used to create a new object with the `Promise.prototype` as its prototype, while replacing it with an empty object `{}` would result in a different object being created.

DONE.
