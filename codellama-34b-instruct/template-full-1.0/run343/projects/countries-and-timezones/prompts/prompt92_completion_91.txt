  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid country id"
```
This would result in different behavior because a different string value would be passed to the `getCountry` function, which would cause it to return a different country object or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because a null value would be passed to the `getCountry` function, which would cause it to return a null country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an undefined value would be passed to the `getCountry` function, which would cause it to return a null country object.

DONE.
