  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while the `+ 1` would add an extra character to the length, potentially causing the `diff()` method to miscalculate the difference between the two strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while the `- 1` would subtract an extra character from the length, potentially causing the `diff()` method to miscalculate the difference between the two strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while the `* 2` would double the
