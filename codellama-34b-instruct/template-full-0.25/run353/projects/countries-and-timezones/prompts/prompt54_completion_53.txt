  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.filter(tz => tz.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns all timezones, while this code fragment returns only deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.map(tz => tz.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an object with timezone names as keys and timezone objects as values, while this code fragment returns an array of timezone names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.reduce((acc, tz) => acc + tz.offset, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an object with timezone names as keys and timezone objects as values, while this code fragment returns the sum of all timezone offsets.

DONE.
