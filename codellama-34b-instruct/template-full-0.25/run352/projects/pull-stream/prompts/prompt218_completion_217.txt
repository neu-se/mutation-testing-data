  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err, cb` would call the `cb` function with the error and the data, while the new code fragment `err, null` would call the `cb` function with the error and `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err, cb` would call the `cb` function with the error and the data, while the new code fragment `null, err` would call the `cb` function with `null` and the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err, cb` would call the `cb` function with the error and the data, while the new code fragment `err, data` would call the `cb` function with the error and the data.

DONE.
