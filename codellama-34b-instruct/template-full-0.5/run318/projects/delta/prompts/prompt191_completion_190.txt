  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain` would be assigned a value of `otherOp.retain`, which may not be the same as `thisOp.retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain` would be assigned a value of `null`, which may not be the same as `thisOp.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain` would be assigned a value of `0`, which may not be the same as `thisOp.retain`.

DONE.
