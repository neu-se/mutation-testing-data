  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones + options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `options` to `timezones` instead of passing them as separate arguments to the `deliverTimezones` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the `deprecated` property of `options` to the `deliverTimezones` function, instead of passing the entire `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(timezones), options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the values of the `timezones` object as an array, instead of passing the object itself.

DONE.
