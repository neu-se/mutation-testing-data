  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.pow()` returns the result of a number raised to a power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, whereas `Math.pow()` returns the result of a number raised to a power.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil()` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number, whereas `Math.pow()` returns the result of a number raised to a power.

DONE.
