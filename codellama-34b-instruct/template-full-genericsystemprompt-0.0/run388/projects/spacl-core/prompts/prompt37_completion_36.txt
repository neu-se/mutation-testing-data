  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would be applied to the array after slicing, which would reverse the order of the elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.slice(1).sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sort()` method would be applied to the array after slicing, which would sort the elements in the array in ascending order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.slice(1).filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method would be applied to the array after slicing, which would remove any falsy values from the array.

DONE.
