  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance / sin(this.bearing(point))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `calculateDistance()` method to calculate the distance between `this` and `point`, while the new code fragment calculates the distance by dividing the distance parameter by the sine of the bearing between `this` and `point`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(Math.pow(distance, 2) - Math.pow(this.distance(point), 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `calculateDistance()` method to calculate the distance between `this` and `point`, while the new code fragment calculates the distance by taking the square root of the difference between the squared distance parameter and the squared distance between `this` and `point`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * Math.sin(this.bearing(point))
```
This
