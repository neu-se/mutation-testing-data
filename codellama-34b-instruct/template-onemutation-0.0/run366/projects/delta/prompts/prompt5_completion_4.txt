  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which inverts the truthiness of the operand. In this case, `keepNull` is a boolean variable, so when it is inverted, it becomes `false` if it was originally `true`, and `true` if it was originally `false`. This means that the `if` statement would be executed if `keepNull` is `false`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
