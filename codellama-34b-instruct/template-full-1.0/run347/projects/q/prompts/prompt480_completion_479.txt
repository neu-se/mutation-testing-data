  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop(at)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the reason from the `unhandledReasons` array, which would cause the `unhandledReasons.length` to decrease by 1, potentially leading to inconsistent state of the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a new element into the `unhandledReasons` array at the specified index, potentially leading to inconsistent state of the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(at)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the reason to the end of the `unhandledReasons` array, potentially leading to inconsistent state of the `unhandledReasons` array.
