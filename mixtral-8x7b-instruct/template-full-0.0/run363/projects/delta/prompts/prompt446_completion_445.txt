 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Op.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not include parentheses, meaning it is accessing the property `length` of the `Op` object, while the modified code would attempt to call a function named `length` on the `Op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `length` property of the `Op` object, while the modified code is using the `length` property of the `ops` array, which would return the number of elements in the array rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max(0, this.ops[this.index].length - this.offset)
