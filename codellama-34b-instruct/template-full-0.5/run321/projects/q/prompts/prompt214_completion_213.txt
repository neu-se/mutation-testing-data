  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `isPromiseAlike` function, causing the `if` statement to be entered even if the value is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function is not called, and the `if` statement would not be entered even if the value is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function is called with the `value` variable, which may not be a promise. If `value` is not a promise, the `if` statement would not be entered.

DONE.
