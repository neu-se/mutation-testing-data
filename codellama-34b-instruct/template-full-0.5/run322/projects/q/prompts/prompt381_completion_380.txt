  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves with the value of the original promise, rather than the original promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () { throw value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that rejects with the value of the original promise, rather than the original promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () { return Q(value); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves with the value of the original promise, rather than the original promise itself.

DONE.
