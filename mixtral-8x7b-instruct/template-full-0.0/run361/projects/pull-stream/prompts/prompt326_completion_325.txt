 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
through.once
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `once` function defined in the `through` module instead of the inner `once` function. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the two functions have different contexts or closures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the callback to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop, instead of immediately. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the order of operations is important.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error('Buggy code fragment') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of calling the `once` function. This could help reveal cases where the test suite assumes that the `through` function will not throw an error, even in unexpected situations.

DONE.
