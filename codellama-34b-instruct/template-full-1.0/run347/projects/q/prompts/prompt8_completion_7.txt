  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so the code inside `definition` will not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a function, so the code inside `definition` will not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is not a function, so the code inside `definition` will not be executed.

DONE.
