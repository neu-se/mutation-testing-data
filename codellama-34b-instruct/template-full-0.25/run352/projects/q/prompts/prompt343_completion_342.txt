  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called instead of the `fulfilled` function, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function would be called with the `value` argument, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function would be called with the `rejected` function as an argument, which would result in a different outcome.

DONE.
