 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply` method directly on the `value` object, instead of calling it on the property of the `value` object referenced by the `name` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `apply` method from the global `window` object, which may not exist in non-browser environments or could lead to unexpected results if the `value` object has a property with the same name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `apply` method from the `Math` object, which is not a function and does not have an `apply` method. This would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
