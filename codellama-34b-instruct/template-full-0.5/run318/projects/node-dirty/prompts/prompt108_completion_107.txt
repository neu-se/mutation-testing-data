  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the buffer is empty, while this new code fragment checks if the length of the buffer is equal to 0. If the buffer is empty, the length will be 0, but if the buffer contains any characters, the length will be greater than 0, so the behavior will be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.includes('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the buffer is empty, while this new code fragment checks if the buffer includes the empty string. If the buffer is empty, this new code fragment will return true, while the original code fragment will return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the buffer is empty, while this new code fragment checks if the buffer is empty after trimming any whitespace characters. If
