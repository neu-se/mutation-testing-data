  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `newException.message` is a string, while `newException` is an object. The `reject` function expects an object as its argument, so passing a string would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `newException.stack` is a string, while `newException` is an object. The `reject` function expects an object as its argument, so passing a string would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `newException.name` is a string, while `newException` is an object. The `reject` function expects an object as its argument, so passing a string would cause an error.

DONE.
