  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `a` will be added to `b`, then subtracted from `a`, resulting in the value of `b` being returned. This is different from the original code fragment `a`, which would simply return the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b ^ 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `a` will be multiplied by `b` squared, which is different from the original code fragment `a`, which simply returns the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` will be subtracted from `a`, which is different from the original code fragment `a`, which simply returns the value of `a`.

DONE.
