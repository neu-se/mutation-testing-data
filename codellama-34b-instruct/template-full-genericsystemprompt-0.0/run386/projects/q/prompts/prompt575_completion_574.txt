  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `bind` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different effects on the `this` context and the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` and `bind` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different effects on the `this` context and the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a bound `this` context, and passing `null` as the first argument would result in a different `this` context than the original function.

DONE.
