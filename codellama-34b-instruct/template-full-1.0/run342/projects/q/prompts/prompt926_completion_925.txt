  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if the callback is undefined, the promise would immediately be rejected with a TypeError, rather than being resolved with the original callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if the callback is a no-op function, the promise would immediately be resolved with the undefined value, rather than being resolved with the original callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the callback is null, the promise would immediately be resolved with the null value, rather than being resolved with the original callback.

DONE.
