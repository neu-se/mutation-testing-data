  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator increments the value of `line.length` by 1, which would cause the `line` string to be longer than it should be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*=` operator multiplies the value of `line.length` by 2, which would cause the `line` string to be twice as long as it should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length -= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-=` operator decrements the value of `line.length` by 1, which would cause the `line` string to be one character shorter than it should be.

DONE.
