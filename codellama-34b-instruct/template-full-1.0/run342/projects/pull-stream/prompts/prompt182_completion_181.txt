  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- cb, abort, onAbort
+ cb, null, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` parameter is being set to `null`, which would cause the `abortCb` function to not be called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- cb, abort, onAbort
+ cb, () => {}, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` parameter is being set to a function that returns an empty object, which would cause the `abortCb` function to not be called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- cb, abort, onAbort
+ cb, undefined, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` parameter is being set to `undefined`, which would cause the `abortCb` function to not be called with the correct arguments.
