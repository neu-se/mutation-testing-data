  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the +Math.PI term would shift the result by 180 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg + 2 * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the +2*Math.PI term would shift the result by 360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only compute the real part of the result, ignoring the imaginary part.

DONE.
