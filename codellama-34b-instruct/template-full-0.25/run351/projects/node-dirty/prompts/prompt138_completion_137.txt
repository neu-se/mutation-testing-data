  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key `key` in the `this._data` map, whereas the original code fragment would return the value associated with the key `key` in the `this._data` map if it exists, or `undefined` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key `key` in the `this._data` map plus 1, whereas the original code fragment would return the value associated with the key `key` in the `this._data` map if it exists, or `undefined` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key `key` in the `this._data
