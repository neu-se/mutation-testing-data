  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of the `Object.prototype` and should be called with the object as the context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of the `Object.prototype` and should be called with the object as the context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of the `Object.prototype` and should be called with the object as the context.

DONE.
