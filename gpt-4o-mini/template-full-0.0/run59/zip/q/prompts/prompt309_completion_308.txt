Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject when the promise fails, leading to incorrect handling of errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("Promise rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject with a new error message, regardless of the original reason for rejection, potentially obscuring the actual error that occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Promise settled")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console instead of rejecting the promise, which would prevent the promise from being properly handled in the calling code.

DONE.
