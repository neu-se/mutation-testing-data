  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would result in a `TypeError` when attempted to be called as a function `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeResolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeResolve()` does not have the same behavior as `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` and would resolve the promise with an undefined value instead of a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeReject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeReject()` does not have the same behavior as `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` and would reject the promise with an undefined value instead of a function.

DONE.
