  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `opLength` would be incremented by 1, which would cause the loop to iterate over one more iteration than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `opLength` would be decremented by 1, which would cause the loop to iterate over one fewer iteration than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `opLength` would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the loop to iterate over twice as many iterations as intended.

DONE.
