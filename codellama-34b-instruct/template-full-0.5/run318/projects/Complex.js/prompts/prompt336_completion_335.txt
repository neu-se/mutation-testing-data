  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is always truthy, while the replacement `0` is always falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is always truthy, while the replacement `2` is always truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is always truthy, while the replacement `null` is always falsy.

DONE.
