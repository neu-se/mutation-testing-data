  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` is a different variable than `x`, which could lead to unexpected results in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `x + 1` is a different calculation than `x`, which could lead to unexpected results in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `x`, which could lead to unexpected results in the surrounding code.

DONE.
