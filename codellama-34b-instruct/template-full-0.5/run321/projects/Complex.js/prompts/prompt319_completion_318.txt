  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt(1 - cosh(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different way of calculating the square root of a number.

DONE.
