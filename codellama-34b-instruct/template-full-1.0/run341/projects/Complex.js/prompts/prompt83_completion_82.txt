  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus > minus
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to read a fractional part of the imaginary symbol even if the string begins with "+".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 tokens[i + 1] === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to treat a number followed by "i" as an imaginary number even if the string begins with "+".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== 'i' && c !== 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to ignore the imaginary symbol if it is not the first character in the string.

DONE.
