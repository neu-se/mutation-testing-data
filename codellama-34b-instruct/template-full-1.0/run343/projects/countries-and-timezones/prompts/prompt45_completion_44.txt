  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
 17
```
This would cause the function to return the wrong result because it would always return the the 17th element of the `data.countries` object, regardless of the input parameter.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
  "baz"
```
This would cause the function to return the wrong result because it would always return the value associated with the `baz` key in the `data.countries` object, regardless of the input parameter.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
  data.countries[country].timezones[0]
```
This would cause the function to return the wrong result because it would always return the first timezone in the `data.countries[country].timezones` array, regardless of the input parameter.

DONE.
