  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by `length` steps, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by `length` steps in the other delta, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by one step less than `length`, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
