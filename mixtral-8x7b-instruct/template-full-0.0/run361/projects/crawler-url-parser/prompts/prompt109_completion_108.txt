 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'currentUrl.url, "currentUrl"'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from the `currentUrl` object to a string literal "currentUrl".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
`currentUrl.url, ${currentUrl}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses template literals to include the `currentUrl` object as a string, which was not the behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.path, currentUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument from `currentUrl.url` to `currentUrl.path`.

DONE.
