Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `next` method to always return a single character or element, regardless of the actual length of the operation, potentially leading to incorrect handling of larger operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` method to always return an operation with zero length, which could lead to unexpected results when processing operations that require a non-zero length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the variable `length` directly, which may not be defined or may not represent the intended length, leading to incorrect slicing of the operation and potentially returning an incomplete or erroneous operation.

DONE.
