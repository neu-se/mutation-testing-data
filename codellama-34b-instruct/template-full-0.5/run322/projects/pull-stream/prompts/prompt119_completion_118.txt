  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, while the new code fragment `null` is just a null value and does not have any effect on the program's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, while the new code fragment `undefined` is just an undefined value and does not have any effect on the program's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, while the new code fragment `0` is just a number and does not have any effect on the program's behavior.

DONE.
