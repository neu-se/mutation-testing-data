  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object" && value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any object, not just objects that are instances of the `Promise` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === "[object Promise]"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string that describes the internal class of the object, not the actual object instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor.name === "Promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the constructor function used to create the object, not the actual object instance.

DONE.
