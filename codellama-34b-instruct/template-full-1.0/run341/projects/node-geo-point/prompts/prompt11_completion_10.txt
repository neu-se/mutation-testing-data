  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the key in the point object is now 'longitude', which is not equivalent to the expected 'coordinates' key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates' + 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of the 'coordinates' and 'x' keys would produce a string that is not equivalent to the expected 'coordinates' key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'.replace('o', 'z')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced key string 'coordinates' would produce a different object property lookup, which would not be equivalent to the expected 'coordinates' key.

DONE.
