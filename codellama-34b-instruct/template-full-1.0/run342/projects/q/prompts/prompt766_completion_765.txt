  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` would immediately resolve the promise, causing the error handler to never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would immediately reject the promise, causing the success handler to never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.somethingElse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.somethingElse()` would unlikely exist, causing an error to be thrown.

DONE.
