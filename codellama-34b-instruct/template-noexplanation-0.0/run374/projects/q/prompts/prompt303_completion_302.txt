  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 1
```
This will cause the loop to start at 1 instead of 0, which may cause the loop to skip the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = answerPs.length - 1
```
This will cause the loop to start at the last element in the array instead of the first, which may cause the loop to skip all the other elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = Math.floor(Math.random() * answerPs.length)
```
This will cause the loop to start at a random element in the array, which may cause the loop to skip some elements.

DONE.
