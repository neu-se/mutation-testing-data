  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `array_slice` function, which would return a new array containing the elements of the original array, starting from the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `arguments` object to the `array_slice` function, which would return a new array containing the elements of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array to the `array_slice` function, which would return a new array containing no elements.

DONE.
