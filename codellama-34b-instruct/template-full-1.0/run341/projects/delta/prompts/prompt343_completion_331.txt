  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isset = Op.length(thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `isset` to the length of the current operation, rather than checking if the operation is of type "insert".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length = Op.length(thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `length` to the length of the current operation, rather than using the existing `length` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = Object.keys(thisData)[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the key of the first element in the `thisData` object, rather than using the existing `embedType` variable.

DONE.
