  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = prop(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` function is not defined in the code, so the `map` variable would be undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = prop(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` function is not defined in the code, so the `map` variable would be undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = prop(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` function is not defined in the code, so the `map` variable would be undefined.

DONE.
