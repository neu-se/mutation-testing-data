  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so `pull.apply()` would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, so `ref.unshift()` would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref` is not a function, so `pull.apply()` would throw an error.

DONE.
