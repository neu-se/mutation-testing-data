  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the current index is equal to the length of the string, while the modified code fragment is checking if the current index is greater than or equal to the length of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the current index is equal to the length of the string, while the modified code fragment is checking if the current index is less than or equal to the length of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the current index is equal to the length of the string, while the modified code fragment is checking if the current index is twice the length of the string.

DONE.
