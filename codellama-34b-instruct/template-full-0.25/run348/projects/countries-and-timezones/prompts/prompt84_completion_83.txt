  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `c` is a single character, while `c[0]` is a string of length 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `c` is a single character, while `c.toUpperCase()` is a string of length 1 in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + "a"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `c` is a single character, while `c + "a"` is a string of length 2.

DONE.
