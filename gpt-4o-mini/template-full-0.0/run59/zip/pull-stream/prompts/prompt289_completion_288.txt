Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from `true` to `false`, which may alter the logic of how duplicates are handled, potentially allowing items to pass through that should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the boolean `true` with `undefined`, which could lead to unexpected results if the `unique` function does not handle `undefined` as a valid input, possibly causing it to behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, 'true')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from a boolean `true` to a string `'true'`, which may cause the `unique` function to misinterpret the input and not function as intended, leading to incorrect handling of non-unique items.

DONE.
