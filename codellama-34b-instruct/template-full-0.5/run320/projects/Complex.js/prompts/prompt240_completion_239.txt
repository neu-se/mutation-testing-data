  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is multiplying `r` by 2 and then adding `a`, while the replaced code fragment is multiplying `r` by 2 and then subtracting `a`. This change would cause the function to produce different results for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is multiplying `r` by 2 and then adding `a`, while the replaced code fragment is multiplying `r` by 2 and then adding `b`. This change would cause the function to produce different results for certain input values.
