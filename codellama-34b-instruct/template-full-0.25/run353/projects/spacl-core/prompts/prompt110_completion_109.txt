  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let verb
```
This would result in different behavior because `let` is a block-scoped variable declaration, while `const` is a constant declaration. In this context, using `let` would allow the `verb` variable to be reassigned, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior in the `allow` and `deny` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb = 'GET'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would hardcode the `verb` variable to the value `'GET'`, which would not allow for the same flexibility as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb = this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `verb` variable to the value of the `verbs` object property with the same name as the `verb` variable, which could potentially cause a loop if the `verbs` object has a property with the same name as the `verb`
