Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the arguments passed to the `dispatch` method, specifically using `array_slice(arguments, 0)` instead of `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which means it will include the first argument instead of excluding it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [null, array_slice(arguments, 1)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `null` instead of `void 0` as the first argument, which may lead to different handling of the context (`this`) in the dispatched function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("call", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method from `dispatch("apply", ...)` to `dispatch("call", ...)`, which may alter how the function is invoked and the way arguments are handled, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
