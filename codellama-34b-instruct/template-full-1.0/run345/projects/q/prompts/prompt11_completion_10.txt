  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"place_holder"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string value to the `definition` function, instead of the expected function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a numeric value to the `definition` function, instead of the expected function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `void 0` to the `definition` function, which is equivalent to `undefined`.

DONE.
