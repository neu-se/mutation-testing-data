Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would immediately resolve the promise without waiting for the Node-style callback to be invoked, potentially leading to incorrect promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because using `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, regardless of the outcome of the original function, which is not the intended behavior of appending a Node-style callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing it with a function that returns `null` would not provide the necessary callback for handling the result of the Node-style function, leading to unhandled promise rejections.

DONE.
