  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a reference to the `promise` object itself, so the code would be calling `promise.promiseDispatch` recursively, which would result in a stack overflow error.

DONE.
