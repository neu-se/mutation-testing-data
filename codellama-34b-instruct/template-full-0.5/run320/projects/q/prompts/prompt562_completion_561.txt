  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library and `Q()` returns a promise that is resolved with the value passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a deferred object that has a `resolve` and `reject` method, whereas `Q()` returns a promise that is resolved with the value passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay(1000)` returns a promise that is resolved after 1 second, whereas `Q()` returns a promise that is resolved immediately with the value passed to it.

DONE.
