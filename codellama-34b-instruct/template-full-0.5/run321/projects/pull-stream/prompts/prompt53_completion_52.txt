  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s.source === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s.source` is a function, whereas the original code fragment only checked if `s` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s.source === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s.source` is an object, whereas the original code fragment only checked if `s` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s.source === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s.source` is a number, whereas the original code fragment only checked if `s` is an object.

DONE.
