  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` is a function that calculates the arctangent of a single number, whereas `Math.atan2` is a function that calculates the arctangent of two numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` is a function that calculates the arccosine of a single number, whereas `Math.atan2` is a function that calculates the arctangent of two numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` is a function that calculates the arcsine of a single number, whereas `Math.atan2` is a function that calculates the arctangent of two numbers.

DONE.
