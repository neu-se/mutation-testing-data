  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(object)` expression would be evaluated before the `dispatch` method is called, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the result of the `Q(object)` expression instead of the `object` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` variable would be evaluated before the `dispatch` method is called, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the result of the `object` variable instead of the `object` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword would be evaluated before the `dispatch` method is called, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the result of the `this` keyword instead of the `object` itself.

DONE.
