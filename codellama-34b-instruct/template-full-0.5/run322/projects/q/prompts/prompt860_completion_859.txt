  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the error if the promise is rejected, while the new code fragment would throw the error regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the error, while the new code fragment would reject the promise with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the error, while the new code fragment would resolve the promise with the error.

DONE.
