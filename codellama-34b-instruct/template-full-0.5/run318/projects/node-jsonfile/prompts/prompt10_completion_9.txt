  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse`, which could cause the parsed data to be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is being passed to `JSON.parse` as `null` instead of the original function, which could cause the parsed data to be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || function(key, value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is being passed to `JSON.parse` as a different function than the original, which could cause the parsed data to be different from the original.

DONE.
