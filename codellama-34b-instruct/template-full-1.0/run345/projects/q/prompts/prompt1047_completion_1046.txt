  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws an error if the `closed` promise is not resolved, but if `null` is resolved instead, the `closed` promise will remain pending forever and the code will not terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws an error if the `closed` promise is not resolved, but if `undefined` is resolved instead, the `closed` promise will be resolved with the value `undefined` and the code will not terminate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws an error if the `closed` promise is not resolved, but if a rejected promise is resolved instead, the `closed` promise will be rejected with the given error and the code will not terminate.

DONE.
