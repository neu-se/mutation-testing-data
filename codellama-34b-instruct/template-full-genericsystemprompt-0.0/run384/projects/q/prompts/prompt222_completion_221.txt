  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the constructor of the deferred object, which could affect how the object is initialized and used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `then` method of the deferred object, which is used to handle the resolution or rejection of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `catch` method of the deferred object, which is used to handle the rejection of the promise.

DONE.
