  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops` is an array, rather than checking if `ops.ops` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && typeof ops.ops === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops.ops` is an object, rather than checking if it is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && ops.ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops.ops` is an instance of the `Array` class, rather than checking if it is an array.

DONE.
