  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' + 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of the two strings would produce a different value than the original string, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of the string by 2 would produce a different value than the original string, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the string would produce a different value than the original string, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
