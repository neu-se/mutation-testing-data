  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => !op
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the result of the `predicate` function, while the new code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the `op` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => !op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the result of the `predicate` function, while the new code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the `attributes` property of the `op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => !op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the result of the `predicate` function, while the new code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the `insert` property of the `op
