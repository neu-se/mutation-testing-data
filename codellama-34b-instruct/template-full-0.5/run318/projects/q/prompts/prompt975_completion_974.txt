  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the array, which would cause the `nmapply` function to pass the arguments to the method in a different order than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(array_slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.concat(array_slice)` would create a new array that is the concatenation of the original array with itself, which would cause the `nmapply` function to pass the arguments to the method more than once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x !== 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x !== 0; })` would create a new array that contains only the non-zero elements of the
