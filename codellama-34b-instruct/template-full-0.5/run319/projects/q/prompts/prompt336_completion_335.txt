  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with `promise` as an argument, which would cause the `inspect` function to be called twice with different arguments, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(deferred.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with `deferred.promise` as an argument, which would cause the `inspect` function to be called twice with different arguments, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(Q.resolve(promise));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with the result of `Q.resolve(promise)` as an argument, which would cause the `inspect` function to be called twice with different arguments, potentially leading to different behavior.
