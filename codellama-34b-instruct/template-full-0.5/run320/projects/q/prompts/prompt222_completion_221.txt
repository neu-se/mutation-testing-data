  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `promiseDispatch` is a function that is not defined in the `defer` prototype, and it would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a function that is not defined in the `defer` prototype, and it would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that is not defined in the `defer` prototype, and it would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

DONE.
