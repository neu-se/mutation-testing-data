  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of the generator, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the result of the generator, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the result of the generator, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
