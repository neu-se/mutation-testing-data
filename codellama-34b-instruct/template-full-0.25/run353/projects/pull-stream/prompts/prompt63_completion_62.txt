  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `end` to `abort`, regardless of whether `end` was already truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always negate the value of `end`, regardless of whether `end` was already truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `end` to the result of `end && abort`, regardless of whether `end` was already truthy.

DONE.
