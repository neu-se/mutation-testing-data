  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the expression `test(data)`, making it always false even if the function `test` returns true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data == test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `data == test(data)` checks whether the value of `data` is equal to the result of calling the function `test` with `data` as an argument. This is different from the original expression `!test(data)`, which checks whether the result of calling `test` with `data` as an argument is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data != test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `data != test(data)` checks whether the value of `data` is not equal to the result of calling the function `test` with `data` as an argument. This is
