 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `null` even if the policy exists in the map, causing potential issues when checking the return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the type of the value stored in the map would change from `Policy` to `object`, potentially causing type-checking issues and unexpected behavior when invoking the `query` or `matches` methods on the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Policy('dummy_policy')
```
This would result in different behavior because a new policy would be added to the map, changing the behavior of the `query` and `matches` methods when querying for the original policy. This could expose potential issues in the test suite when checking for specific policy behavior.

DONE.
