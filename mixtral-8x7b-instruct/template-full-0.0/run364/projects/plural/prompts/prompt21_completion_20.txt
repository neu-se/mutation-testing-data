 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.push([match, result])
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of rules will be reversed, potentially changing the output of the `plural` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
var rules = []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rules` array is re-initialized, discarding any previously added rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function addRule(match, result) {
  rules = rules.concat([[match, result]])
  return plural
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rules` array is concatenated instead of unshifted, changing the order of rules and potentially affecting the output of the `plural` function.

DONE.
