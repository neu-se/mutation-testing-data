 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new archiver.Archiver('zip', archiverOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the archive format to 'zip', which may not be desired when calling the `compress` function with a format of 'tar'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
archiver.create('tar', archiverOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an archiver object with the 'tar' format, which may not be desired when calling the `compress` function with a format of 'zip'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new archiver.Archiver('gzip', archiverOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an archiver object with the 'gzip' format, which is not a valid format for the `compress` function and would likely cause an error.

DONE.
