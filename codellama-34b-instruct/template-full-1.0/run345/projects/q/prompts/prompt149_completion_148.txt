  Option 1: One possibility is to change the `unshift` method to `push` instead.  This would cause the new element to be added to the end of the array instead of the beginning, which would result in a different behavior for the program.
```
stacks.push
```
Option 2: Another possibility is to use a different method altogether, such as `concat`.  This would cause the new element to be concatenated with the existing array, which would also result in a different behavior for the program.
```
stacks.concat
```
Option 3: It can be used `reverse` method instead of the `unshift` method.
```
stacks.reverse
```
This would cause the new element to be added to the front of the array in reverse order, which would result in a different behavior for the program.
