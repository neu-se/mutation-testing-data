  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '$')
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the parts would be reversed, causing the resulting regex to match different paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '^')
```
This would result in different behavior because the starting anchor would be at the beginning of the path, rather than the end, which would cause the regex to match different paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the starting anchor would be at the beginning of the path, rather than the end, and the parts would be concatenated in the opposite order, causing the resulting regex to match different paths.

DONE.
