  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the new code fragment `console.log(err)` is a console log statement. The new code fragment would not cause the function to return a value, which would likely cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the new code fragment `null` is a literal value. The new code fragment would not cause the function to return a value, which would likely cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the new code fragment `undefined` is a literal value. The new code fragment would not cause the function to return a value, which would likely cause the test to fail.
