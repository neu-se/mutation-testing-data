  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with a single argument, which is not the expected behavior. The `parse` function expects two arguments, the first being the URL to parse and the second being the base URL to use for resolving relative URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr, baseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with the wrong arguments. The `baseUrl` argument should be the base URL to use for resolving relative URLs, but it is not passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr, embedBaseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with the same argument twice, which is not the expected behavior. The `parse` function expects two different arguments, the first being the URL to parse and the second being the
