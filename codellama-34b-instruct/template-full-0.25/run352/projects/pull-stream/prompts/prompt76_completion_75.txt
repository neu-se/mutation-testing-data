  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now always `false`, which would cause the `read` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable is now always `true`, which would cause the `read` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now always `true`, which would cause the `read` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
