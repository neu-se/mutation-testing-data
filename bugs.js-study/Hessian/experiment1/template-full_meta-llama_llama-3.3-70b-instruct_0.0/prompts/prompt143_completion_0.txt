Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the object is null, but not if it's undefined, and also doesn't account for the case where the object has a '$class' property but its '$' property is null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
is.nullOrUndefined(obj.$)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the '$' property of the object is null or undefined, but doesn't consider the case where the object itself is null or undefined, or where the '$class' property is present but the '$' property is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object is falsy (i.e., null, undefined, 0, '', etc.), which is a broader condition than the original check, and could lead to incorrect handling of certain input values.

DONE.
