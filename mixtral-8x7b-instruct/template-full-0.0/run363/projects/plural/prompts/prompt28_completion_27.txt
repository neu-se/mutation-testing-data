 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty string instead of the correct suffix for the given words. This is because `w.substr(w.length)` will always return an empty string, as it extracts a substring starting from the end of the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an "out of bounds" error when trying to access the character at position `-1`. This is because `w.substr(-1)` is not a valid way to extract the last character of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an "out of bounds" error when trying to access the character at position `w.length` or `w.length + 1`. This is because strings are 0-indexed, and the
