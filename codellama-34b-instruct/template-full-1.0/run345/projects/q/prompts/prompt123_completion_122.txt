  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER in the code for the object_keys function can be replaced with:
```
object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.keys` is a built-in method that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, whereas the original code used a for-in loop to iterate over the keys of an object, which includes both enumerable and non-enumerable properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` is a function that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, whereas the original code used a for-in loop to iterate over the keys of an object, which includes both enumerable and non-enumerable properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Reflect.ownKeys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Reflect.ownKeys()` is a function that returns an array of a given object's own property names,
