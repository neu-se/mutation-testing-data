  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of values, whereas `Object.keys()` returns an array of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of keys in the object, which may be different from the number of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).indexOf('property')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of a specific property in the object, which may not be the same as the number of values.

DONE.
