  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length++
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the value of `length` would continuously increase, causing the `switch` statement to always fall through to the `default` case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate one less time than expected, potentially causing the `switch` statement to fall through to the `default` case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate twice as many times as expected, potentially causing the `switch` statement to fall through to the `default` case.

DONE.
