  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] + 1 }
```
This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different object than the original code, which may cause tests that rely on the original behavior to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] - 1 }
```
This change will also cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different object than the original code, which may cause tests that rely on the original behavior to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] * 2 }
```
This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different object than the original code, which may cause tests that rely on the original behavior to fail.

DONE.
