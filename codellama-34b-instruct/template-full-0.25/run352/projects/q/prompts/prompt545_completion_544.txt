  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` parameter is not being used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](self)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `self` parameter is not being used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is not being used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
