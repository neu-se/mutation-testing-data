  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from -1 instead of 0, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the length of the array instead of 0, potentially skipping all the elements in the array.

DONE.
