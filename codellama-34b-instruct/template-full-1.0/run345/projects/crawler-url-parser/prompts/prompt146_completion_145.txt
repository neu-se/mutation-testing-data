  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.\[a-z]+\$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different regular expression pattern that matches a different set of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/i\.[a-z]+\$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different regular expression pattern that matches a different set of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/.+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different regular expression pattern that matches a different set of characters.

DONE.
