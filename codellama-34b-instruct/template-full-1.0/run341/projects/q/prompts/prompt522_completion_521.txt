  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unevaluated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.reject()` method is called with the value `unevaluated`, which is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.reject()` method is called with the value `throw exception`, which is a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.reject()` method is called with the value `undefined`, which is not a promise.

DONE.
