  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match the same set of URLs as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match the same set of URLs as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match the same set of URLs as the original code fragment.

DONE.
