  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would not be emitted, and any code that relies on that event to function correctly would not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would not be emitted, and any code that relies on that event to function correctly would not work as intended. Additionally, the `close` event would be emitted instead, which could cause unexpected behavior in code that is not designed to handle that event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'flush'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would not be emitted, and any code that relies on that event to function correctly would not work as intended. Additionally, the `flush` event would be emitted instead, which could cause unexpected behavior in code that is not designed to handle that event.

DONE.
