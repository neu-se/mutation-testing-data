  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.insert` is a string, while `elem` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.delete` is a number, while `elem` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.attributes` is an object, while `elem` is an object.

DONE.
