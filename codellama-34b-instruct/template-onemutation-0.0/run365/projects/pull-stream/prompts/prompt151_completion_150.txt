  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The original code fragment called `abortCb` with the correct arguments, but the mutated code fragment is calling it with the wrong arguments, which could cause the function to behave differently or even throw an error.

DONE.
