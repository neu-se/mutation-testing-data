  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a constant value and will always be pushed onto the array, whereas `Q` is a reference to the Q promise library and may contain additional logic that we cannot see from this snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a value that is not `Q`, and may be handled differently by the library in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that is not `Q`, and may be handled differently by the library in certain situations.

DONE.
