  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the href attribute of the current element, which may not be the same as the href attribute of the link element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the href attribute of the first anchor element found within the current element, which may not be the same as the href attribute of the link element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).closest('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the href attribute of the closest ancestor anchor element, which may not be the same as the href attribute of the link element.

DONE.
