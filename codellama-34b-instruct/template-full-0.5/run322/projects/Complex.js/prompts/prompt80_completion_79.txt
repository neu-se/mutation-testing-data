  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of a plus sign, while this replacement is checking for the presence of a minus sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of a plus sign, while this replacement is checking for the presence of a space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of a plus sign, while this replacement is checking for the presence of the letter "I".

DONE.
