  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `current` property to an array containing only the `id` value, instead of an empty array as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `all` property to an array containing only the `id` value, instead of an empty array as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set both the `current` and `all` properties to arrays containing only the `id` value, instead of empty arrays as in the original code.

DONE.
