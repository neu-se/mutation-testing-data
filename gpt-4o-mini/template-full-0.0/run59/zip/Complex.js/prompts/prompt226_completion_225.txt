Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt(a)` calculates the cube root of `a`, which is not equivalent to the square root, leading to incorrect results for the square root of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a + 1)` computes the square root of `a + 1`, which alters the input value and can produce incorrect results, especially when `a` is zero or negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(-a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(-a)` attempts to compute the square root of the negative of `a`, which is not valid for real numbers and would lead to `NaN` (Not a Number) when `a` is positive.

DONE.
