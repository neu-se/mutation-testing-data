  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `transform` is a method that transforms the delta, while `transformPosition` is a method that transforms the position of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.invert
```
This would result in different behavior because `invert` is a method that inverts the delta, while `transformPosition` is a method that transforms the position of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.eachLine
```
This would result in different behavior because `eachLine` is a method that iterates over the lines of the delta, while `transformPosition` is a method that transforms the position of the delta.

DONE.
