  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the property to be deleted from a future turn to a post operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the delete operation to a put operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the delete operation to a remove operation.

DONE.
