 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return after the first line, and the `cb` function would never be called with the `value` or an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return after the first line, and the `cb` function would never be called with the `value` or an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called regardless of the value of `abort`, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly if the `abortCb` function has side effects.

DONE.
