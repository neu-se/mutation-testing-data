  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This change sets the value of `k` to 0, which will cause the loop to only iterate once, since the loop condition is `k < sources.length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = sources.length - 1
```
This change sets the value of `k` to the last index of the `sources` array, which will cause the loop to iterate in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = Math.floor(Math.random() * sources.length)
```
This change sets the value of `k` to a random index within the `sources` array, which will cause the loop to iterate in a random order.

DONE.
