  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match carriage returns instead of line feeds, which could cause issues if the input string contains carriage returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\n\r]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match both line feeds and carriage returns, which could cause issues if the input string contains both types of line breaks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\r\n]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match carriage returns and line feeds in either order, which could cause issues if the input string contains both types of line breaks in different orders.

DONE.
