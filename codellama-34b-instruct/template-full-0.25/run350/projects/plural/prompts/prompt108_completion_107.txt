  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, '') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while this new code fragment removes the 's' character from the end of the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while this new code fragment converts the input word to uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.split('').reverse().join('') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while this new code fragment reverses the order of the characters in the input word.

DONE.
