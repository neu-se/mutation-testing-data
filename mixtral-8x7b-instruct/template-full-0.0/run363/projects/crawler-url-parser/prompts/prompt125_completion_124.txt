 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl instanceof URL
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `linkurl` is an instance of the `URL` class, rather than checking its type as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(linkurl) === '[object URL]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the internal `[[Class]]` property of the `linkurl` object, which is a more reliable way to check the object type in JavaScript.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl.constructor.name === 'URL'
