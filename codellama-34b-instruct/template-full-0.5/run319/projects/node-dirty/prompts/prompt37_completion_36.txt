  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the queue of callbacks, instead of the data stored in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values in the data map, instead of the keys and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys in the data map, instead of the keys and values.

DONE.
