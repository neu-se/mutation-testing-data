  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'object' && arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` is a string, but the code is checking if it is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if the length of `arg` is 1, but it is actually 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'number' && arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` is a string, but the code is checking if it is a number.

DONE.
