  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method is not being called, which means that the `next` method will always return `undefined` instead of the next operation in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next operation in the iterator, but it does not advance the iterator to the next operation. Therefore, if the `peek` method is used in place of `hasNext`, the `next` method will always return the same operation instead of advancing to the next one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property is not being updated correctly. The `index` property should be incremented by 1 for each operation that is returned by the `next` method, but it is not being updated in the
