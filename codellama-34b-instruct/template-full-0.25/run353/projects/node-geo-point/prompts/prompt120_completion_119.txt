  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be off by 1 degree, which could cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance * 2, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance would be doubled, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be inverted, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
