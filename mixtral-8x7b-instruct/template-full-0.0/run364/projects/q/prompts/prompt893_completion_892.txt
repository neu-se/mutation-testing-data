 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return callback }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of `nfcall` to always return a function instead of directly invoking the callback and returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context (`this`) of the callback, which could affect how the callback behaves if it relies on accessing properties of the original object it was a method of.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback || function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a fallback function that does nothing when `callback` is falsy, which could cause the promise to resolve immediately without actually executing the intended callback.

DONE.
