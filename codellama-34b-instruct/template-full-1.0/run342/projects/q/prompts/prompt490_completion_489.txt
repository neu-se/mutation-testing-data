  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (untrackRejection(this));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with `this` as an argument, which would be a reference to the rejected promise. However, this would not actually be desirable, as it would not lead to the same behavior as the original code fragment, which called `untrackRejection` with `promise` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (reason !== 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether `reason` is not equal to `0`, rather than checking whether it is truthy. However, this would not actually be desirable, as it would not lead to the same behavior as the original code fragment, which checked whether `reason` was truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (promise !== this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether `promise` is
