  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```math.sin```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used ```math.exp``` which returns the exponential value, while ```math.sin``` would return the sine value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a * 0.5```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used ```x * x``` which squares the value, while ```a * 0.5``` would return half the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.PI / 2```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used ```Math.PI``` which is a variable representing pi, while ```Math.PI / 2``` would return half the value of pi.

DONE.
