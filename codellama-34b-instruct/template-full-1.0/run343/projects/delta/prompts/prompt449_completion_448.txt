  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete !== Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this version checks if it's not equal to infinity. If `op.delete` is a number, it will be converted to `Infinity` in the new version, which could produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this version checks if it's greater than zero. If `op.delete` is a number, it will be converted to `Infinity` in the new version, which could produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this version checks if it's
