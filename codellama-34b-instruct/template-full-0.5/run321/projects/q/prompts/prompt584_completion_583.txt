  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` object is not defined in the scope of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
argument.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `argument` object is not defined in the scope of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object, not the `result` object.

DONE.
