  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(exception) && exception.value !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, but the `exception.value` check ensures that the exception has a `value` property, which is not always the case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(exception) || exception.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, but the `exception.value` check ensures that the exception does not have a `value` property, which is not always the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exception.value === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks if the `value` property of the exception is undefined, but the `isStopIteration` function checks if
