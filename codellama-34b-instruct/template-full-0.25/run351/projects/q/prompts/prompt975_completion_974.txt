  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the array, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(array_slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.concat(array_slice)` would return a new array that is twice the size of the original array, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.splice(0, 1)` would remove the first element of the array, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
