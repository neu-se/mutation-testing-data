  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash (`/`) as the path separator, while the replacement code uses a backslash (`\`). This could cause issues with the parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash (`/`) as the path separator, while the replacement code uses a space (` `). This could cause issues with the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash (`/`) as the path separator, while the replacement code uses a double backslash (`\\`). This could cause issues with the parsing of the URL.

DONE.
