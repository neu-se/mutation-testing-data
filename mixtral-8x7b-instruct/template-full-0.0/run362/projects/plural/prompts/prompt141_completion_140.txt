 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict'; word
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[0]` argument is not passed to the function, which could cause issues if the function relies on that argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
word, 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[0]` argument is replaced with a string primitive, which could cause issues if the function expects a regular expression object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
word, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[0]` argument is replaced with an empty object, which could cause issues if the function expects a regular expression object or a string.

DONE.
