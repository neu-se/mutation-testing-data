  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the negative of the input `x`, instead of the absolute value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return twice the input `x`, instead of the absolute value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x^2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the square of the input `x`, instead of the absolute value.

DONE.
