  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because `port1` and `port2` are different ports, and `postMessage` is a method that can be called on a port to send a message. Using `port1` instead of `port2` would cause the message to be sent on a different port, which could potentially cause issues with the code that is expecting to receive the message on `port2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `postMessage` expects a message as an argument, and `0` is not a valid message. This could cause an error or unexpected behavior when the code tries to send the message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage("hello")
```
This would result in different behavior because `postMessage` expects a message as an argument, and "hello" is not a valid message
