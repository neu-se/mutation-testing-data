  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, while the original code used the `===` operator to check for equality. This means that the mutated code would consider an operation to be an insert if it is not an insert, which would lead to incorrect behavior in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for equality, while the original code used the `!==` operator to check for inequality. This means that the mutated code would consider an operation to be a delete if it is not a delete, which would lead to incorrect behavior in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for
