Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the exception, it resolves the promise with the exception, which changes the promise's state from "rejected" to "fulfilled" with the exception as the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` would not reject the promise, leading to a fulfilled promise with `null` as the value, which could cause confusion in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with a generic string message instead of the original exception, which may lose the context of the actual error that occurred, making debugging more difficult.

DONE.
