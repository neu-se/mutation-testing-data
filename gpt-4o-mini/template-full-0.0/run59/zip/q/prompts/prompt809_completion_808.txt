Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.call === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the execution of the `finally` callback if `callback` is defined and has a `call` method, which does not guarantee that it can be applied correctly in the context of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only throw an error if `callback` is explicitly `null`, allowing any other falsy values (like `undefined` or `false`) to pass through, which could lead to unexpected behavior when the `finally` callback is invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if `callback` is not an object, which would incorrectly reject valid function callbacks that are not objects, such as function literals or arrow functions.

DONE.
