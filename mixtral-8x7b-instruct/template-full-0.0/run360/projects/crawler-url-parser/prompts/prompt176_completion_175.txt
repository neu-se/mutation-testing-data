 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"htttps ://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-window-manager"
```
This would result in different behavior because a mutated URL with an extra 't' in the protocol will not be parsed correctly, causing unexpected results in the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function expects a string as input, and converting the URL to uppercase will cause it to fail since it does not handle uppercase protocols.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function does not handle null inputs, and it would cause an error when attempting to access the `protocol` property of the `null` value.

DONE.
