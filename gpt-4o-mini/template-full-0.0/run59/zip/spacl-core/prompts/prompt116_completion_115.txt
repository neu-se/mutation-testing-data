Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.keys(this.verbs))
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over all verbs in the `verbs` object, including those that may not be denied, rather than only the verbs passed as arguments to the `deny` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs.slice(0, 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it only denies the first verb in the `verbs` array, ignoring any additional verbs passed to the method, which could lead to incomplete denial of actions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of [...verbs, 'default'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a 'default' verb to the list of verbs being denied, which may not be intended and could lead to unexpected access control behavior.

DONE.
