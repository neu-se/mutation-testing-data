 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns only the own enumerable and non-enumerable properties of an object, while `Object.keys` returns only the own enumerable properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.ownKeys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Reflect.ownKeys` returns all own property keys of an object, including non-enumerable properties, while `Object.keys` returns only the own enumerable properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.parse('["key"]')
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse('["key"]')` returns an array with a single string element, while `Object.keys` returns an array of strings representing the enumerable properties of an object. This change would cause the `reduce` function to fail, as it expects an object as the initial
