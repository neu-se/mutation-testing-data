  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not present in the original code fragment, and it would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` if `spaces` is not an array or a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value if `spaces` is a number, as it would add 1 to the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value if `spaces` is a number, as it would concatenate the string 'a' to the value.

DONE.
