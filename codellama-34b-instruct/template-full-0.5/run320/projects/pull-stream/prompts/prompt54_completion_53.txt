  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.source` is a function that returns a new source, while `s.sink` is a function that returns a new sink.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source()
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.source()` is a function that returns a new source, while `s.sink` is a function that returns a new sink.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink()
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.sink()` is a function that returns a new sink, while `s.source` is a function that returns a new source.

DONE.
