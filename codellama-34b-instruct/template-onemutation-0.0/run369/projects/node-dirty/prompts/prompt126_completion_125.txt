  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the event is not the same. In the original code, the `'write_close'` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, but in the modified code, the `'write_error'` event is emitted instead. This could cause the code to behave differently, such as not handling the error correctly or not closing the write stream properly.
