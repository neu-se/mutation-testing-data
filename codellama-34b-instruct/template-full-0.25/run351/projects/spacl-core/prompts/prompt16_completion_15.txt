  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment requires the path to end with a slash, while the new code fragment only requires the path to start with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment allows any character after the last slash, while the new code fragment only allows alphanumeric characters and underscores.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/[a-zA-Z0-9_]+(?:\/[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment allows only one level of nesting, while the new code fragment allows any number of levels of nesting.

DONE.
