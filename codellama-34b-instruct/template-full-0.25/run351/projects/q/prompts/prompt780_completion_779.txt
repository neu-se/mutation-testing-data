  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` returns a promise for the state of the promise, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(noop)` returns a promise for the result of the `noop` function, which is undefined, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return promise; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(function() { return promise; })` returns a promise for the result of the function, which is the promise itself, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the promise itself.

DONE.
