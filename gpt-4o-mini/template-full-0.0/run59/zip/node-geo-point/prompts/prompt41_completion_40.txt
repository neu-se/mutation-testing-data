Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the latitude of `point2` instead of `point1`, leading to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from using the cosine of `point1Rad` to using the sine, which would yield a completely different result in the distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point1Rad + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to `point1Rad`, which alters the angle used in the cosine function, leading to an incorrect distance calculation due to the change in the trigonometric value.

DONE.
