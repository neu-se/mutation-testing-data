  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural.bind(null)
```
This will ensure that the `plural` function is called with the correct `this` value, which is important for the function to work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural.call(null)
```
This will also ensure that the `plural` function is called with the correct `this` value, but it will also return the result of the function call directly, rather than returning a new function that wraps the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural.apply(null)
```
This will also ensure that the `plural` function is called with the correct `this` value, but it will also return the result of the function call directly, rather than returning a new function that wraps the original function.

DONE.
