  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square of the sum of the squares of a and b, which is not the same as the square root of the sum of the squares of a and b.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simply add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, without taking their squares or the square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of a and b, which is not the same as the square of the sum of the squares of a and b.

DONE.
