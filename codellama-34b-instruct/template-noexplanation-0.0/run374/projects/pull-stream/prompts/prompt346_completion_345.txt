  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.test
```
This change will cause the function to use the `test` method of the `key` object instead of the `exec` method, which may have different behavior depending on the implementation of the `test` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.match
```
This change will cause the function to use the `match` method of the `key` object instead of the `exec` method, which may have different behavior depending on the implementation of the `match` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.search
```
This change will cause the function to use the `search` method of the `key` object instead of the `exec` method, which may have different behavior depending on the implementation of the `search` method.

DONE.
