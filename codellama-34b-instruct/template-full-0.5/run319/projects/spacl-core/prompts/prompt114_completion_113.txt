  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let verb;
```
This would result in different behavior because `let` creates a new variable binding within the block, whereas `const` creates a constant binding that cannot be reassigned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var verb;
```
This would result in different behavior because `var` creates a variable binding that is function-scoped, whereas `const` creates a constant binding that is block-scoped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb = 'GET';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value `'GET'` to the variable `verb`, whereas the original code fragment did not assign any value to `verb`.

DONE.
