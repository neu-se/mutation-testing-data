  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `id` property of the `c` object as the first argument to `getCountry`, instead of passing the `c` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c, { ...options, deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a new object with the `deprecated` property set to `true` as the second argument to `getCountry`, instead of passing the original `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c, { ...options, allTimezones: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a new object with the `allTimezones` property set to `true` as the second argument to `getCountry`, instead of passing the original `options` object.

DONE.
