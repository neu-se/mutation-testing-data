  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, rather than an array with the first two elements of the `arguments` object, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the second element of the `arguments` object, rather than an array with the first two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the last element of the `arguments` object, rather than an array with the first two elements.

DONE.
