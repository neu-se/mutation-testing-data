  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of "person" as "people", while the new code fragment returns the plural form as "peoples".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of "person" as "people", while the new code fragment returns the plural form as "persons".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'individuals'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of "person" as "people", while the new code fragment returns the plural form as "individuals".

DONE.
