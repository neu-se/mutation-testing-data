  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, while `path.basename` returns the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname` returns the file extension of a path, while `path.basename` returns the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.parse` returns an object with the path's components, while `path.basename` returns a string with the file name.

DONE.
