  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
jsontext
```
This would result in different behavior because `jsontext` is not a function and will cause a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringified
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringified` is not a function and will cause a `TypeError` when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return '{' + stringify(obj, options) + '}'; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the return value of the `stringify` function by adding `{}` around the resulting JSON string.

DONE.
