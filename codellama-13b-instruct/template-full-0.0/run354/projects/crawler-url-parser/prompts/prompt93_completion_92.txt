  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(href, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function is called with the `href` parameter, which is the URL of the link being parsed, instead of the `currentUrlStr` parameter, which is the URL of the current page. This would cause the function to parse the link URL instead of the current page URL, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function is called with the `currentUrlStr` parameter, which is the URL of the current page, instead of the `href` parameter, which is the URL of the link being parsed. This would cause the function to parse the current page URL instead of the link URL, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, true
