 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function would return `true` for any input, including promises that are still pending or have been rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function would return `true` for `null` values, which are not fulfilled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function would always return `true` when called on a promise, regardless of its state. This is because `this` inside the promise's `inspect` method would refer to the promise itself, which is an object, and thus not a primitive value.

DONE.
