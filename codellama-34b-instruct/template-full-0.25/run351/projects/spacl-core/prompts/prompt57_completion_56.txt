  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for a dot or a dollar sign, while the new code fragment matches any character except for a dot.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$]+)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for a dot or a dollar sign, while the new code fragment matches one or more characters except for a dot.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$]*)|([^.$]+)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for a dot or a dollar sign, while the new code fragment matches zero or more characters except for a dot, or one or more characters except for a dot.

DONE.
