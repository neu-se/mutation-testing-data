Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the index by 1 after processing the last line, potentially causing the predicate to be called with an incorrect index value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the index value, which could lead to incorrect line processing or skipping lines entirely, as the index would not correspond to the actual line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the index to 0 every time the predicate is called, causing the predicate to always receive the same index regardless of how many lines have been processed.

DONE.
