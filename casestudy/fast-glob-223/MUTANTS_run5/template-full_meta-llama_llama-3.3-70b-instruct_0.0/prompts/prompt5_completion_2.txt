Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ strict: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `strict` option is set to `true`, which may cause the `isGlob` function to behave more strictly when identifying glob patterns, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is passed as the options, which may cause the `isGlob` function to use default settings, potentially leading to different results compared to the original code that explicitly sets `strict` to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is passed as the options, which may cause the `isGlob` function to throw an error or behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to different results compared to the original code that passes a valid options object.

DONE.
