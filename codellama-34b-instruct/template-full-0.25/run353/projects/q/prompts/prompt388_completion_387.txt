  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error, whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.reject("Test error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error, whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.resolve("Test error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the given error, whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value.

DONE.
