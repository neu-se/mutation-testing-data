  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimLeft` and `trimRight` have different behavior when the string contains whitespace characters, such as spaces or tabs. `trimLeft` only removes whitespace characters at the beginning of the string, while `trimRight` removes whitespace characters at the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substr(1, url.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` returns a substring of the original string, starting at the first character and ending at the specified length. In this case, the substring would start at the second character and end at the second-to-last character of the string. This would change the value of the `url` variable, potentially causing the request to be made to a different endpoint.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase` returns a string with all
