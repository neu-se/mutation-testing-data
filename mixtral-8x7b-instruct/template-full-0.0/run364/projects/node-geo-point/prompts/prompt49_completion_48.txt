 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change negative latitudes to positive, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point2['latitude']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses array-like access to the property, which may not behave the same as the dot notation in certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(<any>point2).latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a type assertion to treat `point2` as an any type, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `point2` is not actually an object with a `latitude` property.

DONE.
