  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is now starting from the third element instead of the second, which would cause the generated regex to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method is now being called on the reversed array, which would cause the generated regex to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(part => part.replace(/\//g, ''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method is now being called on the reversed array, which would cause the generated regex to be different.

DONE.
