  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.val` property is not the same as the `row.key` property, and would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` property is being incremented by 1, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` property is being converted to uppercase, which would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
