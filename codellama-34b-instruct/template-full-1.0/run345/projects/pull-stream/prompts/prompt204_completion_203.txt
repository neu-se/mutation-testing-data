  Sure, I can help you with that! To apply mutation testing to the provided code, we need to replace the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments and check if the tests fail. Here are three options:

Option 1:
```
cb(abort);
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a callback function that takes two arguments (`err` and `data`), but we're only passing in one argument (`abort`).

Option 2:
```
cb(null, abort);
```
This would result in different behavior because we're passing in `null` as the first argument instead of `err`, which may cause the test to fail if it's expecting an error.

Option 3:
```
cb(err, data);
```
This would result in different behavior because we're passing in different variables (`err` and `data`) instead of `abort`, which may cause the test to fail if it's expecting a specific value for those variables.

DONE.
