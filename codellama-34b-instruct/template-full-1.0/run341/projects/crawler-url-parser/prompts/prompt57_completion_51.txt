  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method removes whitespace from both ends of a string, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method converts all characters in a string to lowercase, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^[^:]*:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method removes the protocol (e.g. `http://`) from the beginning of the URL, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

DONE.
