  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would be executed immediately, whereas the original code fragment is a reference to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition
```
This would result in different behavior because the reference to the function would be passed to the `define` function, whereas the original code fragment is a function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression would be evaluated to `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment is a reference to the `definition` function.

DONE.
