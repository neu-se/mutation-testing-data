  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the first argument to the `cb` function, which would cause the `cb` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the second argument to the `cb` function, which would cause the `cb` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as both arguments to the `cb` function, which would cause the `cb` function to return `null` instead of calling the `read` function.

DONE.
