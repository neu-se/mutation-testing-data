  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(null, function (end, data) {
  //if ended immediately, and no initial...
  if(end) return cb(end === true ? null : end)
  acc = data; sink(source)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` function is called with the `source` function as an argument, which is not the same as the original code where `source` is called without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(null, function (end, data) {
  //if ended immediately, and no initial...
  if(end) return cb(end === true ? null : end)
  acc = data; sink(acc)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` function is called with the `acc` variable as an argument, which is not the same as the original code where `source` is called without any arguments.
