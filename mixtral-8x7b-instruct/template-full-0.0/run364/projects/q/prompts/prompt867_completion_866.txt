 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` function would return a promise that resolves immediately, instead of waiting for the specified timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Timeout'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` function would always reject the promise with a timeout error, regardless of the specified timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` function would resolve the promise immediately, instead of waiting for the specified timeout.

DONE.
