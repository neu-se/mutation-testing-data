  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the two objects are not the same object, rather than checking if they are both objects and not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.constructor !== otherData.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the two objects have different constructors, rather than checking if they are both objects and not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(thisData).length !== Object.keys(otherData).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the two objects have a different number of properties, rather than checking if they are both objects and not null.

DONE.
