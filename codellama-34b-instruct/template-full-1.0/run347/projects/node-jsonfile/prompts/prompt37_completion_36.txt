  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str + 'x', options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "x" to the second argument, which would change the content of the file being written.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the third argument, which would change the offset at which the string is written to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding = 'utf16'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the encoding of the file being written, which would cause errors if the file is read with a different encoding.

DONE.
