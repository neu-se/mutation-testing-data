  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality, while this replacement would check for equality after adding 1 to the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality, while this replacement would check for equality after multiplying the value by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality, while this replacement would check for equality after subtracting 1 from the value.

DONE.
