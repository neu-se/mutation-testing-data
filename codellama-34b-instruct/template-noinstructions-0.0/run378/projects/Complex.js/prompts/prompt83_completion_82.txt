  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to 0, which means that the code is expecting to see a `+` or `-` sign followed by a number. However, if we replace the code fragment with `plus + minus === 1`, the code will only check if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to 1, which means that the code will not recognize a `+` or `-` sign followed by a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to 0, which means that the code is expecting to see a `+` or `-` sign followed by a number. However, if we replace the code fragment with `plus + minus === 2`, the code will only check if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to 2,
