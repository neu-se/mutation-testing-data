  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the state of the promise, while the new code fragment returns the state of the promise's inspection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the new code fragment returns the value of the promise's inspection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the reason of the promise, while the new code fragment returns the reason of the promise's inspection.

DONE.
