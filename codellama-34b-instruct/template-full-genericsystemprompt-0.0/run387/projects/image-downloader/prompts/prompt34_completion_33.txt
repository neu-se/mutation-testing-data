  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which would pass the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>` to the `resume` method.

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which would pass the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>` to the `resume` method. Replacing `<PLACEHOLDER>` with `undefined` would cause the `resume` method to be called with an `undefined` argument, which could potentially cause the method to behave differently.
