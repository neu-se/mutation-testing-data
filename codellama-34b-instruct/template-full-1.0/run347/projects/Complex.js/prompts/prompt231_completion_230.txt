  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment computes the absolute value of the difference between `a` and `b`, while this new code fragment computes the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment computes the absolute value of the difference between `a` and `b`, while this new code fragment computes the difference between `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment computes the absolute value of the difference between `a` and `b`, while this new code fragment computes the absolute value of the difference between `a` and `b`, but using the `Math.abs` function instead of the `/` operator.

DONE.
