  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.delay` method to return a resolved promise with a value of `null`, rather than a promise for the resolution of the given promise after the specified delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.delay` method to return a rejected promise with a value of `undefined`, rather than a promise for the resolution of the given promise after the specified delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.delay` method to return a resolved promise with a value of `Q`, rather than a promise for the resolution of the given promise after the specified delay.

DONE.
