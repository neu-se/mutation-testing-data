  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] === prop
```
This change inverts the condition, so that the rule will match if the property is undefined or if the property matches the value in the match array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined && match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This change requires that the property be defined and that the value in the match array does not match the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined && match[index + 1] === prop
```
This change requires that the property be defined and that the value in the match array matches the property.

DONE.
