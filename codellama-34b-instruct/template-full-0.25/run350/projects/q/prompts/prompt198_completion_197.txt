  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is falsy, while this replacement checks if it is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is falsy, while this replacement checks if its length is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof fileNameAndLineNumber === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is falsy, while this replacement checks if its type is "undefined".

DONE.
