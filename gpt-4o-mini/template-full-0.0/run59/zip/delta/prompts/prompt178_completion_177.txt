Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a length of 0 for the `otherOp`, potentially causing the `thisIter.next()` to be called with an incorrect length, leading to unexpected results in the composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation from `thisIter` instead of the length of `otherOp`, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations when composing, potentially skipping or misaligning operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length used for the `otherOp` by 1, which could cause the composition logic to incorrectly process the operations, potentially resulting in an off-by-one error in the final composed delta.

DONE.
