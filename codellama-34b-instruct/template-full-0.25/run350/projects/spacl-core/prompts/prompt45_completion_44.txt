  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the part matches the pattern `:.+`, which means it contains a colon followed by one or more characters. The modified code fragment checks if the part does not match the pattern `:.+`, which means it does not contain a colon followed by one or more characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^:.+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the part matches the pattern `:.+`, which means it contains a colon followed by one or more characters. The modified code fragment checks if the part matches the pattern `^:.+`, which means it starts with a colon followed by one or more characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) !== null && part.match(/^:.+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior
