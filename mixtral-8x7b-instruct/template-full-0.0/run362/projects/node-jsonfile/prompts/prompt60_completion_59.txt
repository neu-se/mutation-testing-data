 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content instanceof Buffer
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `content` is an instance of `Buffer`, instead of checking if `content` is a `Buffer` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `content` is an array, instead of checking if `content` is a `Buffer` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.constructor === Buffer
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `content` was constructed by the `Buffer` constructor, instead of checking if `content` is a `Buffer` object.

By using these mutated code fragments, the tests may not fail if they do not properly check for the correct type of `content`. This would provide a starting point for improving the test suite by adding tests that check for the correct type of `content`.
