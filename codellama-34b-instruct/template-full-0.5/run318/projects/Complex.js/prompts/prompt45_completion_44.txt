  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the type of `a` using `typeof`, but this replacement checks if `a` is a string that is equal to the string `'number'`. This would cause the code to enter the `case 'number':` branch even if `a` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the type of `a` using `typeof`, but this replacement checks if `a` is an object. This would cause the code to enter the `case 'object':` branch even if `a` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the type of `a` using `typeof`, but this replacement checks if `a` is a string. This would cause the code to enter the `
