  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the `message` array, which could potentially cause the promise to be resolved with an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the last element of the `message` array, which could potentially cause the promise to be resolved with an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first element of the `message` array, which could potentially cause the promise to be resolved with an incorrect value.

DONE.
