  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first capture group of the regex match, which is the file name, instead of the second capture group, which is the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third capture group of the regex match, which is the column number, instead of the second capture group, which is the line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second capture group of the regex match, which is the line number, instead of the first capture group, which is the file name.

DONE.
