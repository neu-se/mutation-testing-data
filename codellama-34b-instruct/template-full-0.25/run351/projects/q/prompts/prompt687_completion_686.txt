  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, which would affect the resulting array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array of arguments would be different, as the length of the `arguments` object would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array of arguments would be different, as `null` would be included in the array.

DONE.
