  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) {
    throw error;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, but this new code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) {
    console.log(error);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not log an error, but this new code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) {
    return error;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not return an error, but this new code fragment does.

DONE.
