  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `read` variable is `null` or not, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `read` is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `read` variable has a `length` property and if it is equal to `0`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `read` is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read !== null && read !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `read` is not `null` and not `undefined`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `read` is not a valid function.

DONE.
