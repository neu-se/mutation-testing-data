 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
diff.EQUAL
```
This would result in different behavior because it always treats the components as equal, ignoring the actual content comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
diff.INSERT
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat all components as insertions, even if they are deletions or equal components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
diff.DELETE
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat all components as deletions, even if they are insertions or equal components.

By introducing these changes, the mutated code will produce different results compared to the original code, helping to identify potential weaknesses in the test suite. DONE.
