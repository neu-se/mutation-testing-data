  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a number, but the new code fragment would return a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a number, but the new code fragment would return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a number, but the new code fragment would return undefined.

DONE.
