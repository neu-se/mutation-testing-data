  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if it is not null, while this modified code fragment would call it regardless of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with the `this` context set to the `Dirty` instance, while this modified code fragment would call it with the `this` context set to the `Dirty` instance's prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `cb` function the `key` and `val` arguments, while this modified code fragment would pass it all the arguments passed to the `set` method.

DONE.
