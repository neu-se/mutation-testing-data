  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the `data` string, which could potentially change the JSON parsing behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `data` string to uppercase, which could potentially change the JSON parsing behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `data` string into an array of individual characters, which could potentially change the JSON parsing behavior.

DONE.
