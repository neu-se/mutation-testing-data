 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0.1 * parseFloat
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a multiplication factor, changing the value of the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds the number down to the nearest integer, which is different from the original `parseFloat` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the input value is NaN, which is not the same as parsing a floating-point number.

DONE.
