  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && !onEnd
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called only if `end` is truthy and `onEnd` is falsy, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || onEnd
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called only if `end` is falsy or `onEnd` is truthy, which is also the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== onEnd
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called only if `end` is not equal to `onEnd`, which is a different condition than the original behavior.

DONE.
