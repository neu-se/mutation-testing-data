  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `nodeArgs` is an array of arguments to be passed to the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of an array, whereas `nodeArgs` is an array of arguments to be passed to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements of the original array except the first one, whereas `nodeArgs` is an array of arguments to be passed to the callback function.

DONE.
