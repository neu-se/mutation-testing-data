  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the starting point for the substring, while the new code fragment uses a fixed value of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the starting point for the substring, while the new code fragment uses a fixed value of `word.length - 2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the starting point for the substring, while the new code fragment uses a fixed value of `word.length - 1`.

DONE.
