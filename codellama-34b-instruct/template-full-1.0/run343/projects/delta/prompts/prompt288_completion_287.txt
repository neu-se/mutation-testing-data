  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because a `delete` operation would be performed on the line, rather than a `push` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the line would be reversed, rather than having an element added to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because a slice of the line would be taken, rather than the entire line being pushed.

DONE.
