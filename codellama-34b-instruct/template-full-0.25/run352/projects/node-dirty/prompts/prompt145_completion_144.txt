  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'foo');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with an additional argument `'foo'`, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different value for the `drain` event, which would cause the event to be emitted with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different value for the `drain` event, which would cause the event to be emitted with a different value.

DONE.
