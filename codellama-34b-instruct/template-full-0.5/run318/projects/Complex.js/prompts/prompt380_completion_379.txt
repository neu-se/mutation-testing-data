  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the value of `b` directly, while this new code fragment adds 1 to the value of `b`. This means that the result of the `sinh` function would be different in the two cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the value of `b` directly, while this new code fragment multiplies `b` by 2. This means that the result of the `cosh` function would be different in the two cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the value of `b` directly, while this new code fragment divides `b` by 2. This means that the result of the `tanh` function would be different in the two cases.

DONE.
