  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        (priority || otherIter.peekType() === 'insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator is replaced with `===` which would cause the code to always evaluate to `true` when `thisIter.peekType()` is `'insert'`, regardless of the value of `otherIter.peekType()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        (priority || otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator is replaced with `===` which would cause the code to always evaluate to `true` when `thisIter.peekType()` is `'insert'`, regardless of the value of `otherIter.peekType()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
