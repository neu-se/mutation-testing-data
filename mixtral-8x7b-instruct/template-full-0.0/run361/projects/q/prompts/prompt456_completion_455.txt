 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `indexOf` method of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the `array_indexOf` utility function, which could lead to issues if the library expects the behavior of `array_indexOf` (such as supporting older browsers).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `indexOf` method of the empty array, which may not work as expected if the library relies on the `array_indexOf` utility function having specific behavior or modifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `includes` method of the `unhandledRejections` array, which is not supported in older browsers. This could cause issues if the library needs to support older browsers and relies on the
