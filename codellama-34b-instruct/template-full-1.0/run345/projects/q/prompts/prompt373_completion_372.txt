  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would be called instead of the `Q.onerror` variable, which could cause a crash or unintended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would be called instead of the `Q.onerror` variable, which could cause a crash or unintended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` variable would be overwritten with a new function, which could break any code that relies on the original `Q.onerror` function.

DONE.
