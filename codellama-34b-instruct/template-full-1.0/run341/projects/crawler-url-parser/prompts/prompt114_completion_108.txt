  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    urlMap.get(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get()` method would cause the function to return the value associated with the given key, which would change the outcome of the function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    i.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i.key` syntax would return the key associated with the current value in the loop, which would change the outcome of the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    currentUrl.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl.key` syntax would return the key associated with the current value in the loop, which would change the outcome of the function call.

DONE.
