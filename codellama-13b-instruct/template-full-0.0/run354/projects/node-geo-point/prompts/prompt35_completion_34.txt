  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point1.latitude` property is a number, while the original code fragment `point1Rad` is a variable that is not defined in the code. This would cause a runtime error when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point2.latitude` property is a number, while the original code fragment `point1Rad` is a variable that is not defined in the code. This would cause a runtime error when the code is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is a number, while the original code fragment `point1Rad` is a variable that is not defined in the code. This would cause a runtime error when the code is executed.

DONE.
