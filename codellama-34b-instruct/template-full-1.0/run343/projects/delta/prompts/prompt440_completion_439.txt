  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the insert property is an object and the "typeof" operator will return "object" instead of "string".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the insert property is an object and the "typeof" operator will return "object" instead of "string".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'object' && nextOp.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the insert property is an object and the "typeof" operator will return "object" instead of "string", and the check for null is not needed.
