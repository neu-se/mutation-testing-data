  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `div` method would return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the denominator is infinite, regardless of the numerator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `div` method would return `Complex['ZERO']` when the denominator is zero, regardless of the numerator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `div` method would return `Complex['NAN']` when the denominator is NaN, regardless of the numerator.

DONE.
