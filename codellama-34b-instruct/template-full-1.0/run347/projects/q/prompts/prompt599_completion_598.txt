  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `args` variable is defined in the function signature as a parameter, and using `undefined` would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `args` variable is defined in the function signature as a parameter, and using `null` would cause a different runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `args` variable is defined in the function signature as a parameter, and using a number literal would cause a different runtime error.

DONE.
