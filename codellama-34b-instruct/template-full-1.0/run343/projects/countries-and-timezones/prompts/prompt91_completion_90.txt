  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` returns a timezone object, while `getCountry` returns a country object. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `getTimezone`, the function would return a timezone object instead of a country object, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because `getTimezonesForCountry` returns an array of timezones, while `getCountry` returns a country object. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `getTimezonesForCountry`, the function would return an array of timezones instead of a country object, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountriesForTimezone` returns an array of countries, while `getCountry` returns
