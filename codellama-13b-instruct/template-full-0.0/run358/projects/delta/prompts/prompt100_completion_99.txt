  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastOp.attributes` check is now included, which would cause the `retain` operation to be treated as a `delete` operation if the attributes are present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && !lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!lastOp.attributes` check is now included, which would cause the `retain` operation to be treated as a `delete` operation if the attributes are not present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastOp.attributes.length === 0` check is now included, which would cause the `retain` operation to
