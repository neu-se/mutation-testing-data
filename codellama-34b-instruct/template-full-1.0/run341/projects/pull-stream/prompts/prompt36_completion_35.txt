  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `ref[3]`
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `ref[2]` which refers to the second element of the `args` array, while the new code uses `ref[3]` which refers to the third element of the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `ref[1]`
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `ref[2]` which refers to the second element of the `args` array, while the new code uses `ref[1]` which refers to the first element of the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `args[2]`
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `ref[2]` which refers to the second element of the `args` array, while the new code uses `args[2]` which is not a valid reference to any element in the `args` array.

DONE.
