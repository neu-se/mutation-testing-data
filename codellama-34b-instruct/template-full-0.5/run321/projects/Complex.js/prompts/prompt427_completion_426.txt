  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was raising `10` to the power of `places`, which is not the same as raising `1` to the power of `places`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was raising `10` to the power of `places`, which is not the same as raising `2` to the power of `places`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was raising `10` to the power of `places`, which is not the same as raising `-1` to the power of `places`.

DONE.
