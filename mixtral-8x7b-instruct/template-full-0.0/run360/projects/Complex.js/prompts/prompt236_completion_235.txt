 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant `2.0` is changed to `2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2.0 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of `a` is changed in the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(2.0) * (r - a)
