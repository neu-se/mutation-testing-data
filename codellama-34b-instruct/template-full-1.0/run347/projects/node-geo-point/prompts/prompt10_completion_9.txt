  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.prototype.includes
```
This would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw an error when it calls `includes` on an array, as the `includes` method only exists in the prototype of the `Array` object, not the `Object` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.bind([])
```
This would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw an error when it calls `hasOwnProperty` on an array, as the `hasOwnProperty` method is not a method of arrays, only of objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Null
```
This would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw an error when it tries to access the `hasOwnProperty` method of a null object, as null objects do not have methods.

DONE.
