  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because a function will be invoked and return a value, rather than using the `stream` variable directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because a number will be returned instead of a stream, and the `nextChunk()` function would no longer be called recursively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because a null value would be returned, and the `nextChunk()` function would no longer be called recursively.

DONE.
