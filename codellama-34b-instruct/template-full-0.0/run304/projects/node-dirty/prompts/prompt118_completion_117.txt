  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read_error` event is not emitted when the read stream is closed, but it is emitted when there is an error reading from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write_error` event is not emitted when the write stream is closed, but it is emitted when there is an error writing to the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is not emitted when the read or write stream is closed, but it is emitted when there is an error with either stream.

DONE.
