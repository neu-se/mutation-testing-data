  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the first character of the spec string, rather than the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec[spec.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the last character of the spec string, rather than the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the slice of the spec string starting from the second character, rather than the entire string.

DONE.
