Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Stream ended unexpectedly'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new error object instead of simply signaling the end of the stream, which could lead to the consumer of this function handling the end of the stream incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the data instead of signaling the end of the stream, which could cause the downstream consumer to process a `null` value as valid data instead of recognizing that the stream has ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `end` variable directly to the callback, which may not be the intended behavior if `end` is not a proper error or termination signal, potentially leading to unexpected results in the callback handling.

DONE.
