  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.resolve(options.dest, __dirname);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the `options.dest` path relative to the module's directory (`__dirname`), whereas the original code fragment resolves it relative to the process's current working directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.resolve(options.dest, __filename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the `options.dest` path relative to the module's file (`__filename`), whereas the original code fragment resolves it relative to the process's current working directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.resolve(options.dest, process.cwd());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the `options.dest` path relative to the process's current working directory (`process.cwd()`), whereas the original code fragment resolves it relative to
