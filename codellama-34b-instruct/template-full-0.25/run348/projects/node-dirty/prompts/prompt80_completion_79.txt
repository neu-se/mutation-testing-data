  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.message` is a string, whereas `err` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.code` is a string, whereas `err` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.stack` is a string, whereas `err` is an object.

DONE.
