  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function, which returns the exponential value of a number, while the replacement code fragment uses the unary minus operator, which returns the negative of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function, which returns the exponential value of a number, while the replacement code fragment uses the identity function, which returns the input value unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function, which returns the exponential value of a number, while the replacement code fragment uses the addition operator, which returns the sum of two numbers.

DONE.
