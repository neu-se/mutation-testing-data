  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a function that takes a callback as its last argument, while `fs.writeFileSync` does not take any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` expects a function that returns a promise, while `fs.writeFileSync` does not return a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(function () { return fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a function
