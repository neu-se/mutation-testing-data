  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method is being called on the result of `slice`, which is an array, instead of being called on the original array `spec.split('/')`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method is being called on the result of `reverse`, which is a string, instead of being called on the original array `spec.split('/')`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(x => x.split('').reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method is being called on the result of `reverse`, which is a string, instead of being called on the original array `spec.split('/')
