  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would not consider the last two characters of the input string, leading to incorrect pluralization for some words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would consider the wrong range of characters of the input string, leading to incorrect pluralization for some words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would consider the wrong range of characters of the input string, leading to incorrect pluralization for some words.

DONE.
