  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical not `!` operator changes the result of the `isNaN` function, which checks if a value is not a number. If the value is not a number, `!isNaN` will return `true`, and if the value is a number, `!isNaN` will return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks if a value is a finite number, whereas `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + b) === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of adding two numbers will never be Infinity in the context of this code.

DONE.
