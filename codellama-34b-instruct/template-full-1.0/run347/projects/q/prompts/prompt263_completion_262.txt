  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that rejects the promise with the given value, whereas `fulfill` is a method that fulfills the promise with the given value. Using `reject` instead of `fulfill` would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled, which could potentially cause the code that depends on the promise to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(123);
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method that resolves the promise with a different value, 123, instead of the original value. This could potentially cause the code that depends on the promise to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(value + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method that resolves the promise with a different value, the original value plus 1, instead of the original
