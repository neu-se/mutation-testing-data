  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a new error event with a different message, which would not be caught by the existing error handling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a null error object, which would not be caught by the existing error handling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with an undefined error object, which would not be caught by the existing error handling code.

DONE.
