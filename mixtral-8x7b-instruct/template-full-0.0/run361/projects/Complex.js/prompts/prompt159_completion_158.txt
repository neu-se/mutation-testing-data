 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `z['isZero']()` would always return `false` if `b` is not strictly equal to `0`, even when `z` is a zero complex number with a non-zero real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `z['isZero']()` would always return `true`, even when `z` is not a zero complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z.isZero()
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `z['isZero']()` would now be accessing the `isZero` method from the prototype chain, which might not be the intended behavior if the developer intended to access a custom `isZero` method defined on the `z` object.

DONE.
