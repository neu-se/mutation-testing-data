  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, and would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'](1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, and would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'](0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, and would result in a runtime error.

DONE.
