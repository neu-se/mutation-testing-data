  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.values` is not a function and would throw a `TypeError` when called with `null` as an argument, whereas `values` is a function that can be called with `null` as an argument and would return an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.values.length` would return the length of the `values` array, whereas `values` is a function that returns an array of values from the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.values[0]` would return the first element of the `values` array, whereas `values` is a function that returns an array of values from the stream.

DONE.
