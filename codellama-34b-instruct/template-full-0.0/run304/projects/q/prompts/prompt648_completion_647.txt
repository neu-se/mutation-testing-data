  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on `args` instead of `name`, which would cause the first element of `args` to be removed from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name.slice(1), args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on `name` instead of `args`, which would cause the first element of `name` to be removed from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(name)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method is called on `args` instead of `name`, which would cause the elements of `name` to be added to the end of the `args` array.

DONE.
