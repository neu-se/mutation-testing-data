  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the ! operator would negate the result of the `isZero` method, causing the condition to be always false, even when the complex number is actually zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the result of the `isZero` method would always make the condition true, even when the complex number is not zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isOne']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isOne` method would check if the complex number is equal to 1, which would be a different condition from checking if it is zero.

DONE.
