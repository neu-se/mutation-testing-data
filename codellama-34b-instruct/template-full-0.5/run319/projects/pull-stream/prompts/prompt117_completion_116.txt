  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, depending on the number of arguments passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, depending on the number of arguments passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, depending on the number of arguments passed to it.

DONE.
