  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `substr` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this new code fragment is only removing the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `substr` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this new code fragment is removing the last two characters and adding 'ies'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, '') + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `substr` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this new code fragment is using `replace
