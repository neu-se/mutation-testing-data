  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 1, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splices the array at the index with a single element, while this code splices the array at the index with multiple elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splices the array at the index with a single element, while this code splices the array at the index with no elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index - 1, 1, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splices the array at the index with a single element, while this code splices the array at the index - 1 with a single element.

DONE.
