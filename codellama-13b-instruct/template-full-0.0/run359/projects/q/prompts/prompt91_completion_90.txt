  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to invoke the `slice` method on the `Array.prototype` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to invoke the `slice` method on the `Array.prototype` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to create a new function that is bound to the `slice` method on the `Array.prototype` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
