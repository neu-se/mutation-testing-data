  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise` is a promise that is already resolved, whereas `defer` is a deferred object that can be resolved or rejected later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise.then(function() { return defer; })
```

This means that the new promise will be resolved with the deferred object, rather than the promise that was originally returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise.then(function() { return defer.promise; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise.then()` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is `de
