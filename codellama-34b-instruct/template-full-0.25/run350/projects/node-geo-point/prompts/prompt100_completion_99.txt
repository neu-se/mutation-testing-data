  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, and adding 180 degrees to the result would shift the destination point by 180 degrees, resulting in a different location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, and subtracting 180 degrees from the result would shift the destination point by 180 degrees in the opposite direction, resulting in a different location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, and multiplying the result by 2 would double the destination point's latitude, resulting in a different location.

DONE
