  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i--` operator would decrement the value of `i` by 1, causing the loop to iterate over the array in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i+1` operator would increment the value of `i` by 1, causing the loop to iterate over the array with a different starting index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i*2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i*2` operator would multiply the value of `i` by 2, causing the loop to iterate over the array with a different step size.

DONE.
