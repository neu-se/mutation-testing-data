  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' || (typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is either a number or an object, while this new code fragment checks if `op.retain` is either a number or an object that is not null. If `op.retain` is null, the original code fragment would return true, but the new code fragment would return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && (typeof op.retain === 'object' || op.retain !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is either a number or an object, while this new code fragment checks if `op.retain` is both a number and an object or not null. If `op.retain` is an object that is not null, the original code fragment
