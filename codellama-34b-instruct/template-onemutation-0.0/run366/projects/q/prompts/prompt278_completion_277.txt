  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a given reason, whereas `self.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a given value. If the `makeNodeResolver` function is called with `self.reject` instead of `self.resolve`, it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
