  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.keys()
```
This change will cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the values. This will result in the loop body being executed once for each key in the `verbs` object, rather than once for each value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.values()
```
This change will cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the values of the `verbs` object, rather than the keys. This will result in the loop body being executed once for each value in the `verbs` object, rather than once for each key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of Object.keys(verbs)
```
This change will cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the values. This will result in the loop body being executed once for each key
