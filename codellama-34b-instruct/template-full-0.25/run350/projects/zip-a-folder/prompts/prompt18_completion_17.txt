  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator (`&`) will only return `true` if both `fs.constants.R_OK` and `fs.constants.W_OK` are `true`, whereas the bitwise OR operator (`|`) would return `true` if either `fs.constants.R_OK` or `fs.constants.W_OK` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) will only return `true` if one of `fs.constants.R_OK` or `fs.constants.W_OK` is `true`, whereas the bitwise OR operator (`|`) would return `true` if either `fs.constants.R_OK` or `fs.constants
