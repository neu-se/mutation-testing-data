  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1] * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would change the value of the number being parsed, which would then affect the calculation of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1] - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 would change the value of the number being parsed, which would then affect the calculation of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1] + 0.1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 0.1 would change the value of the number being parsed, which would then affect the calculation of the complex number.

DONE.
