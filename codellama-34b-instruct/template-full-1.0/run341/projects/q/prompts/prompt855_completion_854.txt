  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise immediately, instead of resolving it with the value `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the progress of the operation, instead of resolving or rejecting the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `deferred.resolve` call with an empty function that does not modify the promise's state.

DONE.
