 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not call any of the callback functions in the `cbs` array, potentially causing a loss of functionality or incorrect behavior in the code that relies on those callbacks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the `cbs` array, so any modifications to the original `cbs` array would not affect the copy used in the `for...of` loop. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the code relies on modifying the `cbs` array during the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.sort()
