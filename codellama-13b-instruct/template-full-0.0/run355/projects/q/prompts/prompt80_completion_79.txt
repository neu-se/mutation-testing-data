  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout value is now 1 instead of 0, which would cause the `flush` function to be called later than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function is now called with an additional argument of 1, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function is now called with an additional argument of 0, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
