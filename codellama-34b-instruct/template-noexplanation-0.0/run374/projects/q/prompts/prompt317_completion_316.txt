  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(null)
```
This creates a new object with a null prototype, which can be useful in certain situations where you want to create an object that doesn't inherit any properties or methods from its prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This is similar to the previous option, but it uses the `Object.create()` method instead of the `object_create()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This creates a new object with an empty prototype, which is similar to using `Object.create(null)` but is a bit more concise.

DONE.
