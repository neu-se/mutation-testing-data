  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the file path to be modified, potentially causing the file to be written to the wrong location or not to be written at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo" + file
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the file path to be modified, potentially causing the file to be written to the wrong location or not to be written at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the file path to be modified, potentially causing the file to be written to the wrong location or not to be written at all.

DONE.
