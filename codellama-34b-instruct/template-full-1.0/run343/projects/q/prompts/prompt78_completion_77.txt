  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error()` will throw an error and prevent the execution of any further code in the function, while `flush` will simply call the `flush` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
   return undefined;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function will return `undefined`, while `flush` will call the `flush` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
   return null;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function will return `null`, while `flush` will call the `flush` function.

DONE.
