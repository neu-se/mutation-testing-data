  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because it would eliminate the parsing of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the parsed string into a number, rather than a float.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the parsed float into a string, rather than a float.

DONE.
