  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error message, whereas `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with the given reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(x).join(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(x).join(y)` would return a promise that is resolved with the result of joining `x` and `y`, whereas `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with the given reason.

DONE.
