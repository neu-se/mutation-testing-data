  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original code fragment, which is `/x$|ch$|s$/i`. The new regular expression would match words that end with "x", "ch", or "s", but not words that end with "es".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is not the same as the original code fragment, which is `function(w) { return w + 'es' }`. The new function would append "s" to the word, not "es".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) {
