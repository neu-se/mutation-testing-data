  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.fromLngLatArray(point.coordinates.reverse());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the coordinates before passing them to the `fromLngLatArray` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.fromLngLatArray(point.coordinates.slice(0, 2));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first two elements of the `coordinates` array to the `fromLngLatArray` method, instead of the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.fromLngLatArray(point.coordinates.map(c => c * 2));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply each coordinate by 2 before passing them to the `fromLngLatArray` method, which would result in different latitude and longitude values.

DONE.
