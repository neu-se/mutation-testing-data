  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would throw a `TypeError` when called with `null`, whereas the original code fragment would return an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would throw a `TypeError` when called with `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would return an empty array when called with an empty object, whereas the original code fragment would return an array containing the string `"object"`.

DONE.
