  Option 1:
============

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `<OP_TYPE[2] === 'retain'`. This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` is a function that checks for object equality, but `OP_TYPE[2] === 'retain'` is a boolean expression that checks if the value of `OP_TYPE[2]` is the string 'retain'. In the original code, the `isEqual` function is comparing the two values to determine if they are equal or not, whereas in the mutated code, the `OP_TYPE[2] === 'retain'` expression is checking the value of `OP_TYPE[2]` against the string 'retain' and returning a boolean value.

Option 2:
---------

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `length < this.ops.length`. This would result in different behavior because `length` is a variable that is being incremented in each iteration of the loop, whereas `this.ops.length` is a static property of the `this.ops` array that is not being modified during the loop. In the original code,
