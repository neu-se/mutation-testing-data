 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(op: any, index: number) => true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns true, bypassing the original predicate function, and returning all elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
() => true
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the input arguments and always returns true, bypassing the original predicate function, and returning all elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(op: Op, index: number) => index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it only selects elements at even indices, which may not represent the intended behavior of the original predicate function.

DONE.
