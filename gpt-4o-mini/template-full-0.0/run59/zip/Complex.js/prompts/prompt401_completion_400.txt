Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the imaginary part is greater than zero, which would lead to the opposite action being taken on the real and imaginary parts of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is exactly zero, which would not account for cases where the imaginary part is negative or positive, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part is not equal to zero, which would cause the condition to be true for both positive and negative values, leading to unintended modifications of the result.

DONE.
