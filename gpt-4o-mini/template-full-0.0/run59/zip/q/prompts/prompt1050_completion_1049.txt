Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject(new Error("Queue closed"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the `ends` promise instead of resolving it, causing any subsequent calls to `get` to fail immediately with an error, rather than allowing the queue to be closed gracefully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({head: null});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the `ends` promise with a `head` value of `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `get` method, as it would attempt to retrieve a value that doesn't exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({head: value, tail: null});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `tail` of the queue to `null`, effectively breaking the chain of promises and preventing any further values from being queued, which would disrupt the intended functionality of the queue.

DONE.
