  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1, while this replacement checks if the string has a length greater than 0. This change would cause the matcher to match strings that are one character longer than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.endsWith('/') && string.charAt(0) === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string ends with a slash, while this replacement checks if the string ends with a slash and also checks if the first character of the string is a slash. This change would cause the matcher to match strings that have a slash as the first character and end with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.endsWith('/') && string.charAt(string
