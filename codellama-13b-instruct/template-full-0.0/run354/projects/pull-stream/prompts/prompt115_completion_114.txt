  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would be incremented by 1, which would cause the final result to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would be decremented by 1, which would cause the final result to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the final result to be different.

DONE.
