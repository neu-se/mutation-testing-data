  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!handler.hasOwnProperty('compose')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has a property with the given name, and returns `true` if it does. In this case, if the `handler` object does not have a `compose` property, the `getHandler` method would throw an error, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.compose === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` keyword is used to check if a variable or property is not defined. In this case, if the `handler` object does not have a `compose` property, the `getHandler` method would throw an error, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof handler.compose !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is used to check if a variable or property is
