  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would return `x` and `y` as a tuple, rather than fulfilling with the value of `x` if it is the same as `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would return a promise that fulfills with the sum of `x` and `y`, rather than fulfilling with the value of `x` if it is the same as `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would return a promise that fulfills with the product of `x` and `y`, rather than fulfilling with the value of `x` if it is the same as `y`.

DONE.
