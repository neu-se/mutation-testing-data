  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only access the first element of the `coordinates` array, instead of the entire array as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only access the second element of the `coordinates` array, instead of the entire array as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only access the third element of the `coordinates` array, instead of the entire array as intended.

DONE.
