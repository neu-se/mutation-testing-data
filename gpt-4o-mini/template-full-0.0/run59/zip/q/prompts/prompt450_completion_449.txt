Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!reason || typeof reason.stack === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it will incorrectly track the rejection if `reason` is falsy or if `reason.stack` is not defined, leading to potential unhandled rejections being recorded incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && typeof reason.message !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of `reason.message` instead of `reason.stack`, which may lead to situations where the stack trace is not recorded even if the reason is a valid error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && reason.stack === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `reason.stack` is explicitly `null`, which would not account for cases where `reason.stack` is an empty string or undefined, potentially leading to incorrect handling of rejection reasons.

DONE.
