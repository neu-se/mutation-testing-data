  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones` object as an argument, which is not the same as calling it with the `data` object as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones` object as an argument, which is not the same as calling it with the `data` object as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones).current
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones` object as an argument, and then access the `current
