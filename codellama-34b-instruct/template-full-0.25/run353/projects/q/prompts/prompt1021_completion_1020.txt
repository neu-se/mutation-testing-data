  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, deferred.makeNodeResolver()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is not part of the original code fragment, and it would cause the `ninvoke` method to return a promise that is resolved with the result of the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function, instead of the result of the `object.dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, deferred.reject]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function is not part of the original code fragment, and it would cause the `ninvoke` method to return a promise that is rejected with the result of the `deferred.reject` function, instead of the result of the `object.dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, deferred.resolve]
```
This would result in different
