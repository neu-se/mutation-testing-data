Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used to encode a URI, which is the opposite of what `unescape` does, potentially leading to incorrect URL decoding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURIComponent` encodes all characters except A-Z a-z 0-9 - _ . ! ~ * ' ( ), whereas `unescape` decodes escape sequences, potentially leading to incorrect URL decoding for certain characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(x) { return x; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this function simply returns the input string without any decoding, whereas `unescape` decodes escape sequences, potentially leading to incorrect URL decoding.

DONE.
