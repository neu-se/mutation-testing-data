  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the input word and append "ices", while this code fragment uses `substr` to remove the last two characters and append "ices" without checking the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the input word and append "ices", while this code fragment uses `substr` to remove the last two characters and append "ices" without checking the input word.
