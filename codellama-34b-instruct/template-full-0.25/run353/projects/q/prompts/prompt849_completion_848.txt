  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is called with a different argument than the original code. In the original code, the `deferred.reject` method is called with the `error` argument, which is an Error object. In the modified code, the `deferred.reject` method is called with the `error` argument, which is a string. This would cause the promise to be rejected with a string, rather than an Error object, which could cause issues with error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is called with a different argument than the original code. In the original code, the `deferred.resolve` method is called with the `value` argument, which is a promise. In the modified code, the `deferred.resolve` method is called with the `value` argument, which is a string.
