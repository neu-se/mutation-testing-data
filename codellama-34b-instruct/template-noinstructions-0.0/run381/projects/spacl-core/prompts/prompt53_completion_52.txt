  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the entire match, while the new code fragment only captures the first group.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the trailing slash, while the new code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the optional trailing slash, while the new code fragment does.

DONE.
