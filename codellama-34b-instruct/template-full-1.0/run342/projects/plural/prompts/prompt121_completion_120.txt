  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/xs$/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ics` suffix would not be matched, resulting in wrong pluralization for words like "statistics".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/cs$/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ics` suffix would not be matched, resulting in wrong pluralization for words like "classics".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/s$/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any word ending with `s`, resulting in wrong pluralization for non-standard plural words like "ox" (which should be pluralized as "oxen").

DONE.
