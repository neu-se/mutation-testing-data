  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Different operator
pendingCount >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise, regardless of whether all promises in the array have been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Different constant
pendingCount === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise when only one promise in the array has been resolved, not when all promises have been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Different variable
pendingCount2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise when the count of unresolved promises in the `pendingCount2` variable is zero, not when the count of unresolved promises in the `pendingCount` variable is zero.

DONE.
