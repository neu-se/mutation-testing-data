  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is the imaginary part of the complex number, and multiplying it by `places` would give a different result than multiplying the `re` property by `places`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because dividing the `re` property by `places` would give a different result than multiplying it by `places`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because dividing the `im` property by `places` would give a different result than multiplying it by `places`.

DONE.
