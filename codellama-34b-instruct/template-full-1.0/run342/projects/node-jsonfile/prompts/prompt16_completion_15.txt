  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFile()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop, as the `_readFile` function calls itself recursively without any base case to stop the recursion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFile(file, options = { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the default encoding for reading the file to 'utf8', which could cause issues if the file contains non-UTF8 characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFile(file, options = { throws: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the default behavior for handling errors while reading the file to not throw an error, which could cause the program to silently ignore errors that should be handled.

DONE.
