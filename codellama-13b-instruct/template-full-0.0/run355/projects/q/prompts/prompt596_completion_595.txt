  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in different behavior because the `self` object would be passed as the first argument to the `callback` function, rather than the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `args` array would be passed as the first argument to the `callback` function, rather than the `self` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the first argument to the `callback` function, rather than the `self` object or the `args` array.

DONE.
