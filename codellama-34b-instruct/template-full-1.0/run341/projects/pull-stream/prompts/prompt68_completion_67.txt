  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn("Warning: Done invoked with an error but no done callback provided");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would only log a warning to the console if the `done` callback was not provided, but this modified code would log the warning regardless of whether the `done` callback was provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Error: Done invoked with an error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would only log an error to the console if the `done` callback was provided and the error was not null or undefined, but this modified code would log the error regardless of whether the `done` callback was provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr = new Error("Done callback is required");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would create a new `Error` object with the message "Done callback is required" if the `done` callback was not provided, but
