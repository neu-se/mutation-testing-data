  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    throw err;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the promise is rejected, while this new code fragment throws an error regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    return err;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the error if the promise is rejected, while this new code fragment returns the error regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    return Q.reject(err);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns a rejected promise if the promise is rejected, while this new code fragment always returns a rejected promise regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
