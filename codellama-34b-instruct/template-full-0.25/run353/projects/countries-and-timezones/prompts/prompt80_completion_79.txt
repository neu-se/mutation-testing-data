  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the timezone name, which would cause the function to return a different timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the timezone name to uppercase, which would cause the function to return a different timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the characters in the timezone name, which would cause the function to return a different timezone.

DONE.
