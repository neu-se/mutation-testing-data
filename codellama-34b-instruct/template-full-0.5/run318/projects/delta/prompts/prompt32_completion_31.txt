  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` function to always return an empty object, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` function to return an object with the same keys as the input, but with the values inverted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` function to always return an empty object, regardless of the input.

DONE.
