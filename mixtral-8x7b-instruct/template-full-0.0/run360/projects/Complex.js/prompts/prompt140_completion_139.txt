 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return Infinity when dividing by zero when the dividend is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && this['isZero']()
