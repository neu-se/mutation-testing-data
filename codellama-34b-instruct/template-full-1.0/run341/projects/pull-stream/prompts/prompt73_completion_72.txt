  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(abort || null, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `read` function with `abort` and `done` arguments, while the replaced code fragment calls `read` with `abort || null` and `done || function () {}` arguments. This change would cause the `read` function to be called with different arguments, which could potentially result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(abort || function () {}, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `read` function with `abort` and `done` arguments, while the replaced code fragment calls `read` with `abort || function () {}` and `done || function () {}` arguments. This change would cause the `read` function to be called with different arguments, which could potentially result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEH
