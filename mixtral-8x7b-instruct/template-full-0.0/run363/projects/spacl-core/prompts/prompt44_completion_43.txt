 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
min = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a minimum occurrence of 1, while the original code does not change the minimum when adding a new part. This could lead to unexpected matches or failures to match certain patterns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
min = max = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets both minimum and maximum occurrences to 1, while the original code only sets the minimum to 1. This could lead to failing to match certain patterns with more than one occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
parts.push('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an empty string to the parts array, which is not equivalent to any of the cases in the switch statement. This could lead to unexpected matches or failures to match certain patterns.

DONE.
