  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the file path to uppercase, which could potentially cause issues if the file path is used as a key in a map or if it is compared to another file path that is in a different case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.split('/').join('\\')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` and `join()` methods would change the file path to use backslashes instead of forward slashes, which could potentially cause issues if the file path is used on a system that uses forward slashes as the path separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.replace('\\', '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace all backslashes in the file path with forward slashes, which could potentially cause issues if the file path is used on a system
