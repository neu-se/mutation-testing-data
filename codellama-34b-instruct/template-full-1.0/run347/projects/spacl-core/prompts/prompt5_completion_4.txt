  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is an empty string, which will never match any input string, whereas `spec.match` will match if the input string is an empty string or if it matches the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `match` method, whereas `spec.match` will always be a regular expression object and will have a `match` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `match` method, whereas `spec.match` will always be a regular expression object and will have a `match` method.

DONE.
