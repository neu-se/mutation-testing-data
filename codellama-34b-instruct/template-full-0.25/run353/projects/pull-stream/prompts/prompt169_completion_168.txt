  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues if the function is called with the arguments in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues if the function is called with the arguments in a different order than expected.
