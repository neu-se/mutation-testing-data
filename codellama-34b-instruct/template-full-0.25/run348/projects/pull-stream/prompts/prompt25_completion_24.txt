  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1], ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to behave differently when the arguments are not commutative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the function, which could cause it to behave differently when the number of arguments is not equal to the number of parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is being replaced with a different value, which could cause the function to behave differently when the third argument is not the same as the original value.

DONE.
