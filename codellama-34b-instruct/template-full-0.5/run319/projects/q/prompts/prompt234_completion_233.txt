  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called on `null` instead of `resolvedPromise`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called on `undefined` instead of `resolvedPromise`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called on the number `0` instead of `resolvedPromise`, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
