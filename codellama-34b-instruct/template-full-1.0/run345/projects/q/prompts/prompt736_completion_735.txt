  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop, as the returned promise would be resolved with itself, creating a recursive resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled(Promise.reject())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned promise to be rejected, as `allSettled` is rejecting the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.map.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned promise to be resolved with an array containing the result of calling the `inspect` method on each element of the iterable object, which is different from the original code that resolves with an array of states for the respective values.

DONE.
