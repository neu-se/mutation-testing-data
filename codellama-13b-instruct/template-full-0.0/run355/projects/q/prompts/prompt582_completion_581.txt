  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "next"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "next" operator would cause the generator to continue executing, whereas the "throw" operator would cause the generator to throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "send"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "send" operator would cause the generator to send a value to the next iteration, whereas the "throw" operator would cause the generator to throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "return" operator would cause the generator to return a value, whereas the "throw" operator would cause the generator to throw an exception.

DONE.
