  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a function that checks if a value is a finite number, while `!isFinite` is a negation of that function, meaning it checks if a value is not a finite number. This change would cause the `isFinite` function to always return `false`, which would lead to incorrect results in the `isInfinite` function.

DONE.
