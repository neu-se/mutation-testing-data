Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object itself has the own property, instead of checking if the object has the property for the given key, potentially leading to incorrect results when the object has inherited properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
canonicalizedObj
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the canonicalized object has the own property, instead of checking if the original object has the property, which could lead to incorrect results if the canonicalization process modifies the object's properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current execution context (`this`) has the own property, instead of checking if the object has the property, which could lead to incorrect results if the function is called in a different context.

DONE.
