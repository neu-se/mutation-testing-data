  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.pop` would remove the last element from the `ref` array, whereas `ref.unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.shift` would remove the first element from the `ref` array, whereas `ref.unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `ref` except the first one, whereas `ref.unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
