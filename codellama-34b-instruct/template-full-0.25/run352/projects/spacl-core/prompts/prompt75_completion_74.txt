  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `res === true` checks if the result is exactly `true`, while `res !== true` checks if the result is not exactly `true`. This means that if the result is `false` or any other value, the condition will be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res == true
```
This would result in different behavior because `res === true` checks if the result is exactly `true`, while `res == true` checks if the result is equal to `true`. This means that if the result is `true` or any other value that is equal to `true`, the condition will be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res != true
```
This would result in different behavior because `res === true` checks if the result is exactly `true`, while `res != true` checks if the result is not equal to `true`. This means that if the result is `false` or any other
