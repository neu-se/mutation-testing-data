  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would not execute, as `null` is not iterable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would not execute, as `undefined` is not iterable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would execute once, as `0` is a valid value for the iterator. However, the loop would not iterate over any elements, as `0` is not an object with a `Symbol.iterator` property.

DONE.
