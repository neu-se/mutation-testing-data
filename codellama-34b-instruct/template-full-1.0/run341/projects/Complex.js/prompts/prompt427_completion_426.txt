  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
20
```
This would result in a different value being returned from the `pow()` method, as `Math.pow(20, places || 0)` would produce a different result than `Math.pow(10, places || 0)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in a different value being returned from the `pow()` method, as `Math.pow(null, places || 0)` would produce a different result than `Math.pow(10, places || 0)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would produce a different result from the `pow()` method, as `Math.pow("hello", places || 0)` would throw a `TypeError` exception, while `Math.pow(10, places || 0)` would return a valid result.

DONE.
