 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would always execute its block of code, even when unhandledRejections tracking is disabled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would only execute its block of code when `trackUnhandledRejections` is explicitly set to `false`, allowing for a potential difference in behavior when `trackUnhandledRejections` is `undefined` or `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would always execute its block of code, as the falsy value of `0` would not be equal to the truthy value of `true`.

DONE.
