  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'ges'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would recognize "goose" as a valid plural form, while the new code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geese', 'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would recognize "geese" as a valid plural form, while the new code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would recognize "goose" as a valid plural form, while the new code would not.

DONE.
