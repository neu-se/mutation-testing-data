  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `value` is returned, but in the mutated code, `null` is returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `value` is returned, but in the mutated code, `undefined` is returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `value` is returned, but in the mutated code, an error is thrown.

DONE.
