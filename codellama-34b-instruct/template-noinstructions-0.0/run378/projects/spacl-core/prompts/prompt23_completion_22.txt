  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a substring of the original string, starting from the second character, whereas the original code fragment would return the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a substring of the original string, starting from the second character, whereas the original code fragment would return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a substring of the original string, starting from the second character, whereas the original code fragment would return the entire string.

DONE.
