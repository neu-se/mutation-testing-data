  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is missing, which would cause the function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) && false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& false` would cause the function to always return `false`, regardless of the result of the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) || true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|| true` would cause the function to always return `true`, regardless of the result of the `test` function.

DONE.
