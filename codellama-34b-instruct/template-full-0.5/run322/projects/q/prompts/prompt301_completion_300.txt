  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the arguments passed to the `join` method, which could potentially cause the method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the same value for both arguments to the `join` method, which could potentially cause the method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, that]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to the `join` method, which could potentially cause the method to return a different result.

DONE.
