  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to always return the value of the promise, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to always return the reason for the promise's rejection, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.state)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to always return the state of the promise (i.e., "fulfilled" or "rejected"), regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
