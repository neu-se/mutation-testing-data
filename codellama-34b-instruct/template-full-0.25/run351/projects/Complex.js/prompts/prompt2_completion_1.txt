  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.abs()` function to compute the absolute value of `x`, while the replacement code fragment uses the `+` operator to add `1` to `x`. This change would cause the function to return a different value for some inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.abs()` function to compute the absolute value of `x`, while the replacement code fragment uses the `*` operator to multiply `x` by `2`. This change would cause the function to return a different value for some inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.abs()` function to compute the absolute value of `x`, while the replacement code fragment uses the `/` operator to divide `x` by `
