  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error, whereas the original code would only log the error to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the error, whereas the original code would only log the error to the console.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error, whereas the original code would only log the error to the console.

DONE.
