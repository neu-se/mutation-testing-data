  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `addRule` would be called with the same arguments twice, which could cause unintended consequences in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function passed as the second argument would be called with the wrong argument `w`, which could cause the function to produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', function(w) { return w + 'z' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function passed as the second argument would be called with the wrong argument `w`, which could cause the function to produce unexpected results.

DONE.
