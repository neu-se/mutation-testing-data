  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `0` is passed to the `deferred.reject` function, which could cause an unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `null` is passed to the `deferred.reject` function, which could cause an unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `undefined` is passed to the `deferred.reject` function, which could cause an unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
