 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies `b` and `z['re']` instead of swapping them. This change would affect the result when the base is a purely imaginary number and the exponent is not an integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(b, z['re'])
