  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This change will cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error, as the `toUpperCase()` method is not defined for the `content` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.length
```
This change will cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error, as the `length` property is not defined for the `content` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('')
```
This change will cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error, as the `split()` method is not defined for the `content` variable.

DONE.
