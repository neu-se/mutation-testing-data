  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This change will cause the `sub` method to return `Complex['NAN']` when either `this` or `z` is infinite, instead of only when both are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This change will cause the `sub` method to return `Complex['NAN']` when `this` is infinite and `z` is not infinite, instead of only when both are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This change will cause the `sub` method to return `Complex['NAN']` when `this` is not infinite and `z` is infinite, instead of only when both are infinite.

DONE.
