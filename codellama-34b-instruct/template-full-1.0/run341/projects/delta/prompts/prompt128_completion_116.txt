  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate more times than necessary, potentially leading to unexpected results or crashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one fewer time than necessary, potentially leading to missed bugs or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one more time than necessary, potentially leading to unexpected results or crashes.

DONE.
