 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Array global's slice method instead of the utility module's array\_slice function. This could cause issues if the code relies on the array\_slice function having specific behavior that differs from the global slice method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the slice method on the nodeArgs array instead of the utility module's array\_slice function. This could cause issues if the code relies on the array\_slice function having specific behavior that differs from the array's slice method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the slice method from the Array prototype instead of the utility module's array\_slice function. This could cause issues if the code relies on the array\_slice function having specific behavior that differs
