 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Array global's slice method instead of the utility module's array\_slice function. The global slice method creates a new array containing a shallow copy of a portion of an existing array, whereas the array\_slice function can handle various types of input, not just arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Math global's max method, which returns the largest of zero or more numbers. This would cause an error since it expects an array-like object and a function to slice it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the array\_slice function with null, which would cause an error when trying to call a method on a null value.

DONE.
