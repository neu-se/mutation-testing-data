  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator matches zero or more characters, whereas the `+` operator matches one or more characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator matches one or more characters, whereas the `*` operator matches zero or more characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.?/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator matches zero or one character, whereas the `*` operator matches zero or more characters.

DONE.
