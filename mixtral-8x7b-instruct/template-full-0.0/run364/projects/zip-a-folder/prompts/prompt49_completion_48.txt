 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
() => zipArchive.finalize()
```
This would result in different behavior because the finalize function would be called immediately, without waiting for the data to be fully written to the output stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive.finalize()
```
This would result in different behavior because the finalize function would be called synchronously, instead of being wrapped in a Promise. This could cause issues if the calling code is expecting the function to return a Promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
() => zipArchive.finalize().then(() => undefined)
