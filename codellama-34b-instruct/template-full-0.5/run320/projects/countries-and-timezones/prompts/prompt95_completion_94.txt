  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because `country` is an object, and `!country` would check if the object is falsy, which it never is. `!country.id` would check if the `id` property of the `country` object is falsy, which could potentially be `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.id` is never `undefined`, but `country.id === undefined` would check if the `id` property of the `country` object is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id !== country.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.id` and `country.name` are never equal, but `country.id !== country.name` would check if the `id` property of the `country` object is not equal to the `name
