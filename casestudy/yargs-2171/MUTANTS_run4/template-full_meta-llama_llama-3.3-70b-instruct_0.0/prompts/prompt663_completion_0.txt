Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(descriptions, key) && typeof desc === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logical operator from "or" to "and", requiring both conditions to be true for the `describe` method to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof desc === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type check for `desc` from 'string' to 'number', which would only allow numeric descriptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(descriptions, key) && typeof desc === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type check for `desc` from 'string' to 'object' and also keeps the "not has own property" check, allowing object descriptions only when the key is not present in `descriptions`.

DONE.
