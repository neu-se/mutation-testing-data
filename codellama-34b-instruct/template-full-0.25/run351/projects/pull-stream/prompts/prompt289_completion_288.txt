  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unique
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `unique` function, causing it to return `false` when the item is unique, and `true` when it is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function is called with a different second argument, which would cause it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function is called with a different second argument, which would cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
