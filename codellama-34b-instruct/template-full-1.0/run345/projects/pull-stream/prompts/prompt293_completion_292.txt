  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'integer' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because `integer` is a different type than `number`, and `test` is a function, not a number, so this condition would never be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a function and has no `length` property, so this condition would never be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof test === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a function, not an object, so this condition would never be true.

DONE.
