  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the entire operation, while this code fragment deletes only the first character of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the entire operation, while this code fragment deletes the operation plus one additional character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the entire operation, while this code fragment deletes the operation minus one additional character.

DONE.
