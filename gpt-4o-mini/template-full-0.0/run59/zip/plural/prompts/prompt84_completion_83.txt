Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'moose'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'moose' is a singular noun that does not follow the same pluralization rule as 'mouse', which becomes 'mice'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'mooses' is an incorrect pluralization of 'mouse', while the correct plural is 'mice'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'men'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'men' is the plural form of 'man', which does not relate to 'mouse' and would not trigger the same pluralization logic.

DONE.
