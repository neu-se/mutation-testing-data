  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `op.retain` is a number. The original code fragment uses `typeof` to check if `op.retain` is a number, which would return `true` if `op.retain` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `op.retain` is 1. The original code fragment uses `typeof` to check if `op.retain` is a number, which would return `true` if `op.retain` is 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `op.retain` is an object. The original code fragment uses
