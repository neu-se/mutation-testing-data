  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes, games, illnesses, misc, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be included in the array, which would cause the `addRule` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes, games, illnesses, misc, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be included in the array, which would cause the `addRule` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes, games, illnesses, misc, NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `NaN` value would be included in the array, which would cause the `addRule` function to throw an error.

DONE.
