  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid expression that returns a promise, while the buggy code fragment is not a valid expression and would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid expression that returns a promise, while the buggy code fragment is not a valid expression and would result in a syntax error.
