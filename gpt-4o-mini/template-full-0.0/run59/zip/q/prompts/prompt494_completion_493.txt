Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the rejection reason to be lost, leading to unhandled rejections being reported without any context about the failure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the actual rejection reason with a generic string, making it difficult to diagnose the specific cause of the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access a `reason` property on the current promise context, which may not exist, potentially leading to an undefined value being used instead of the actual rejection reason.

DONE.
