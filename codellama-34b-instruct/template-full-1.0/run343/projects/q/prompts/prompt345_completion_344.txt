  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `reject` method on the promise, which rejects the promise with the given reason. However, using `throw` would throw an exception, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that exception as the reason.
DAONE.
