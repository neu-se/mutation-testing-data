  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return `undefined`, even if there are differences between the two objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return `undefined`, even if there are differences between the two objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return `undefined`, even if there are differences between the two objects.

DONE.
