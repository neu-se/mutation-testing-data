 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now converts the input word to uppercase instead of returning the input as it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.slice(1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now returns the input word without the first character instead of returning the input as it is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'a' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now appends the letter 'a' to the input word instead of returning the input as it is.

DONE.
