  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of individual characters, rather than an array of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(" ", 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of strings, but only include the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(" ", 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of strings, but only include the first two elements of the array.

DONE.
