  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `deferred.reject(error)` inside the `setTimeout` function, which would delay the rejection of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `deferred.reject(error)` inside the `setTimeout` function, which would resolve the promise with the error instead of rejecting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `deferred.reject(error)` inside the `setTimeout` function, which would notify the promise with the error instead of rejecting it.

DONE.
