  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzMap
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the `tzMap` object, rather than the `countries` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first country in the `countries` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the length of the `all` array for each country, rather than the `current` array.

DONE.
