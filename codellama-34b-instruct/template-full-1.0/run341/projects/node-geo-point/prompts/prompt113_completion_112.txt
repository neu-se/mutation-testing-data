  Sure, here are three different options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is being used instead of the longitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the calculation is being reduced by 180 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the calculation is being increased by 180 degrees.

DONE.
