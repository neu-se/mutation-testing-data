  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*#L(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches a literal "#L" instead of "@", which could cause it to skip over legitimate stack frames.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*\@(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches a literal number instead of the expected "at" or "@", which could cause it to misinterpret stack frames.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.+@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now requires the "@ " separator to be present, which could cause it to misinterpret stack frames.

DONE.
