  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/gi, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regular expression global, meaning it will match all occurrences of the words in the list, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.toLowerCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method is added, which will convert all words in the list to lowercase, even if they are not already in lowercase.

Option 3
