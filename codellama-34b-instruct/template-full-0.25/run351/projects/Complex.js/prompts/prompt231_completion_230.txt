  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the `Math.sqrt` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the complex square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is used in the calculation of the complex square root, and replacing it with `b` would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + b` expression would cause the `Math.sqrt` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the complex square root.

DONE.
