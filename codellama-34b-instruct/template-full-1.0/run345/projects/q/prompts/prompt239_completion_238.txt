  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the resolved promise, which could change its value and potentially break the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the Q function, which has a different purpose in the code than the resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("my error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Error object with a different message, which could change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
