  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `data`, regardless of whether the test function returned `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, !data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the negation of `data`, regardless of whether the test function returned `true` or `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, Math.random())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a random number, regardless of whether the test function returned `true` or `false`.

DONE.
