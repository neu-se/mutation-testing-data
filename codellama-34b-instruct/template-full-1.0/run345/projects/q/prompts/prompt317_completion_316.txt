  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function(){}` is an empty function, while `object_create` is a function that creates a new object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, while `object_create` is a function that creates a new object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Function` creates a new function object, while `object_create` is a function that creates a new object.

DONE.
