  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a typo in the word "bacterium" and the correction to "bacteria" would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a typo in the word "bacterium" and the correction to "bacteria" would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a typo in the word "bacterium" and the correction to "bacteria" would result in a different output.

DONE.
