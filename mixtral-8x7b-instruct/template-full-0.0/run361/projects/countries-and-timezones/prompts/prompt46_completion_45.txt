 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty object to the `getTimezone` function, ignoring the original `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes a new object even if the `options` object is falsy, potentially causing issues if the `getTimezone` function relies on properties from the original `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options && options.someProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes the `someProperty` of the `options` object, if it exists, to the `getTimezone` function. If `someProperty` does not exist or the `options` object is falsy, it will pass `undefined`, potentially causing issues if the `getTimezone` function relies on other properties from the `options` object.

DONE.
