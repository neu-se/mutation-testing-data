  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `z['im']` to `0` when the input string is empty or contains only whitespace, while the modified code fragment sets it to `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `z['re']` to `0` when the input string is empty or contains only whitespace, while the modified code fragment sets it to `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `z['im']` to `0` when the input string is empty or contains only whitespace, while the modified code fragment sets it to `1`.

DONE.
