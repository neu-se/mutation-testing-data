  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pluralize words ending in "o" as "os", while this code fragment would pluralize them as "es".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pluralize words ending in "o" as "os", while this code fragment would pluralize them as "ies".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pluralize words ending in "o" as "os", while this code fragment would pluralize them
