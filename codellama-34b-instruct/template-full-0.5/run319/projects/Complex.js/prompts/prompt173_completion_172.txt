  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the value of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['ZERO']`, regardless of the value of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0 && z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['ONE']`, regardless of the value of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
