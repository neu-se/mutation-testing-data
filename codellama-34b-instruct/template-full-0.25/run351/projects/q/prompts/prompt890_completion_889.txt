  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be passed as a single argument to `nfapply`, rather than as individual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` argument would be passed as a second argument to `nfapply`, which would cause the function to return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be passed as a second argument to `nfapply`, which would cause the function to return a resolved promise with a value of `undefined`.

DONE.
