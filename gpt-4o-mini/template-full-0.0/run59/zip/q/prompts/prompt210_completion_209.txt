Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array to the callback instead of the original arguments, causing the callback to receive no parameters, which may lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the callback instead of the original arguments, which could cause the callback to fail if it expects an array or specific parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the callback instead of all the original arguments, potentially leading to incorrect behavior if the callback relies on multiple parameters.

DONE.
