  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array that is the concatenation of `value` and `args`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array where each element is the result of calling the provided function on the corresponding element of `args`, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
