  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected `_value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `true` instead of the expected `_value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `false` instead of the expected `_value`.

DONE.
