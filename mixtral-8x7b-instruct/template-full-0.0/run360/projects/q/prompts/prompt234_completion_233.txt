 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new resolved promise instead of using the existing `resolvedPromise` object. This could cause issues if any dependent code expects the specific `resolvedPromise` instance to be used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `resolvedPromise` to `null`, which could cause errors in any dependent code that expects a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `resolvedPromise` with the `deferred` object, which has different properties and methods. This could cause errors in any dependent code that expects a promise object with specific properties and methods.

DONE.
