 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` only returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, causing an infinite loop when trying to consume the same operation in the next iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing 0 as the argument to `next()` will not advance the iterator, causing an infinite loop when trying to consume the same operation in the next iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing -1 as the argument to `next()` is not a valid operation and would throw an error, causing the `compose` method to fail.

DONE.
