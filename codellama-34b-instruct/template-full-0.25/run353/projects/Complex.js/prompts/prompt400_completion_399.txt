  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1 - 1`, which would result in a value of 0. Replacing it with `1 + 1` would result in a value of 2, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `a - b`, which would result in a value of 0. Replacing it with `a + b` would result in a value of `a + b`, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `a / b`, which would result in a value of 1. Replacing it with `a * b` would result in a value of `a * b`, which would cause the test to fail.
