  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a variable defined in the scope of the surrounding code fragment, and it is not the same as `otherIter.peekLength()`, which is a function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.length` is a property that returns the length of the iteration, while `otherIter.peekLength()` is a method that returns the length of the next element in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.length` is a property that returns the length of the `other` delta, while `otherIter.peekLength()` is a method that returns the length of the next element in the iteration.

DONE.
