  # Dear developer,

I have applied mutation testing to the code you provided, and I have identified three possible code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER in order to introduce a bug in the code.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the radian value of phi 2, which is a different value than the radian value of phi 1, which was calculated in the previous line. This would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect, potentially leading to navigation errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(λ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the radian value of lambda 1, which is a different value than the radian value of phi 1, which was calculated in the previous line. This would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect, potentially leading to navigation errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
