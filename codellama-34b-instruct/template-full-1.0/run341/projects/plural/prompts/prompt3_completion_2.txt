  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the slice of the string starting from the index -2, instead of -1, which would result in a different output for certain input strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-10
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the slice of the string starting from the index -10, instead of -1, which would result in a different output for certain input strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the slice of the string starting from the index 10, instead of -1, which would result in a different output for certain input strings.

DONE.
