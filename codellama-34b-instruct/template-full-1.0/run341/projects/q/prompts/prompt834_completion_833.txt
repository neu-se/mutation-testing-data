  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
null, fulfilled, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback will only be called with the `fulfilled` argument, which is the promise's resolved value. The other two arguments, `rejected` and `progress`, will not be passed to the callback.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
rejected, null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback will only be called with the `rejected` argument, which is the promise's rejection reason. The other two arguments, `fulfilled` and `progress`, will not be passed to the callback.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progress

This would result in different behavior because the callback will only be called with the `progress` argument, which is the promise's progress value. The other two arguments, `fulfilled` and `rejected`, will not be passed to the callback.

DONE.
