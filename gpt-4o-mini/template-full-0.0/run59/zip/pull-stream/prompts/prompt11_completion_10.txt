Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because starting the loop index `i` at 1 instead of 0 would skip the first argument in the `args` array, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when processing the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because initializing `i` to -1 would cause the loop to never execute, as the condition `i < length` would be false from the start, resulting in no arguments being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length
```
This would result in different behavior because starting `i` at `length` would cause the loop to not execute at all, leading to the `args` array being completely ignored and potentially returning an undefined or incorrect value.

DONE.
