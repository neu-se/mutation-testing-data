  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `Complex('test')`
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to throw an error, as it is not expecting a string argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `Complex(a * b)`
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return a complex number with `a * b` as the real part and 0 as the imaginary part, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `Complex(a + b)`
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return a complex number with `a + b` as the real part and 0 as the imaginary part, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
