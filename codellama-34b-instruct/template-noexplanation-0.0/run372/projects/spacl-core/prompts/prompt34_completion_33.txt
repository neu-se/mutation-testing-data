  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This change will cause the `compile` function to skip the first segment of the path specification, which may cause the generated regular expression to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This change will cause the `compile` function to join the segments of the path specification with a forward slash, which may cause the generated regular expression to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(part => part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1'))
```
This change will cause the `compile` function to replace any special characters in the path segments with their escaped versions, which may cause the generated regular expression to be incorrect.

DONE.
