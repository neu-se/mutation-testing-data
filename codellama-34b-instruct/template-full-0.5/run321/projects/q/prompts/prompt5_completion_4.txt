  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the `definition` function, which may cause it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty object as the second argument to the `definition` function, which may cause it to behave differently than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string as the second argument to the `definition` function, which may cause it to behave differently than the original code.

DONE.
