  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not defined for the `nextOp` object, and would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is not defined for the `nextOp` object, and would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is not defined for the `nextOp` object, and would return `undefined`.

DONE.
