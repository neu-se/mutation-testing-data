  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, but `null` is not a string, so the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, but `undefined` is not a string, so the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, but `{}` is an object, so the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error.

DONE.
