  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason` is not defined and will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall(this).then(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is used instead of `callback` and will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall(reason).then(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason` is passed as an argument to `fcall` and will throw an error.

DONE.
