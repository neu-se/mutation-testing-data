  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments of the `promiseDispatch` function starting from the second argument, instead of passing the entire `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments of the `promiseDispatch` function starting from the second argument, instead of passing the entire `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments of the `promiseDispatch` function starting from the second argument, instead of passing the entire `arguments` object.

DONE.
