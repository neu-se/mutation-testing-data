  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was simply defining a function named `define`, whereas this replacement code throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was simply defining a function named `define`, whereas this replacement code evaluates to 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<empty string>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was simply defining a function named `define`, whereas this replacement code evaluates to an empty string.

DONE.
