  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promises).all();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of values, whereas `Q.allResolved` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promises).allSettled();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.allSettled` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of states (either fulfilled or rejected) for the given promises, whereas `Q.allResolved` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promises).any();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.any` returns a promise that is fulfilled with the value of the first resolved promise, whereas `Q.allResolved` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promises
