  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() || !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the expression, making the expression always evaluate to `true` when one of the operands is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite()` method checks whether the value is a finite number, rather than checking for infinity. This would make the expression always evaluate to `true` when one of the operands is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the expression to evaluate to `true` when one of the operands is infinite or zero, rather than only when both operands are infinite.

DONE.
