  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not present, while the new code fragment checks if the file extension is an empty string. This change would cause the code to behave differently for files with no extension.

DONE.
