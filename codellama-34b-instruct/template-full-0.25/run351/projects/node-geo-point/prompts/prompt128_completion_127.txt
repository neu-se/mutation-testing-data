  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the latitude and longitude values, which could cause the calculation to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitude values of both points, which could cause the calculation to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the longitude values of both points, which could cause the calculation to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
