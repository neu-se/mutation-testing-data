  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not called, which means that the promise will not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with `undefined` as the argument, which means that the promise will be resolved with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with `null` as the argument, which means that the promise will be resolved with the value `null`.

DONE.
