  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if the value is greater than 0, and -1 is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if the value is greater than 0, and 0 is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if the value is greater than 0, and 1 is greater than 0.

DONE.
