  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test.test` is a function and `test.test(data)` would call that function with `data` as an argument, potentially returning a different result than `test.test` alone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test + data
```
This would result in different behavior because `test.test` is a function and `test.test + data` would concatenate the result of calling `test.test` with `data` as an argument, potentially returning a different result than `test.test` alone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test * data
```
This would result in different behavior because `test.test` is a function and `test.test * data` would multiply the result of calling `test.test` with `data` as an argument, potentially returning a different result than `test.test` alone.

DONE.
