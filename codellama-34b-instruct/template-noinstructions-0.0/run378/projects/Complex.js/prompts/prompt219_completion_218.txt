  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `log` function would be applied to a different value, which would change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `log` function would be applied to a different value, which would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `log` function would be applied to a different value, which would change the result of the function.

DONE.
