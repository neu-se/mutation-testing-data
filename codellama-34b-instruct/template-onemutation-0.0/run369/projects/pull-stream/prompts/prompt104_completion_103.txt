  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `drain` is a function that returns a stream, while the new code fragment `drain.pipe(process.stdout)` is a method call that pipes the stream to the standard output.

DONE.
