  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `true` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would cause the `host` property to be set to the value of the `currentUrlStr` parameter, which would cause the `baseUrl` to be set to the value of the `currentUrlStr` parameter in the `parse` function, leading to different behavior in the `extract` function.
