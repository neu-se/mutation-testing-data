  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default.+?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression is using `{1}` to match one occurrence of the preceding group, while the new regular expression is using `+?` to match one or more occurrences of the preceding group.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\d+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression is using `[a-z]+` to match one or more letters, while the new regular expression is using `\d+` to match one or more digits.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default[a-z]+/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression is using a case-sensitive match, while the new regular expression is using a case-insensitive match with the `/g` flag. Additionally, the original regular expression is matching only one occurrence of the pattern, while the new regular expression is matching all occurrences of the
