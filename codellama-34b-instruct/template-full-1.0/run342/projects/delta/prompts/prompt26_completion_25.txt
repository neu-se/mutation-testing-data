  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's values, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's keys. In the context of the code, `Object.keys(attributes)` is used to iterate over the keys of the `attributes` object, while `Object.values(attributes)` would iterate over the values of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs of the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of keys. In the context of the code, `Object.keys(attributes)` is used to iterate over the keys of the `attributes` object, while `Object.entries(attributes)` would iterate over the key-value pairs of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.size
```
This would result in different behavior
