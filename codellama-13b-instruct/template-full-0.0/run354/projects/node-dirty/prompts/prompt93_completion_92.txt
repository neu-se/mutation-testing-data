  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Empty lines always appear in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, indicating that the test suite is not as effective as the developers might have hoped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be the same as the original code, indicating that the test suite is effective.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Empty lines sometimes appear in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, indicating that the test suite is not as effective as the developers might have hoped.

DONE.
