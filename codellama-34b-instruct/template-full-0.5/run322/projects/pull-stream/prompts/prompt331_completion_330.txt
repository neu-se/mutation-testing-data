  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that takes one argument, but `end` and `data` are two separate arguments. This would cause the `once` function to be called with two arguments, which is not its intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd` is a function that takes one argument, but `end` and `data` are two separate arguments. This would cause the `onEnd` function to be called with two arguments, which is not its intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end) onEnd(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd` is a function that takes one argument, but `data` is not the same as `end`. This would cause the `onEnd` function to be called with the wrong argument, which is not its
