 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression for the `chilli` rule, while this replacement uses a string. This could cause issues if the input word contains characters that have special meaning in regular expressions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
addRule('chilli', function(w) { return w + 'x' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `'chillies'` string as
