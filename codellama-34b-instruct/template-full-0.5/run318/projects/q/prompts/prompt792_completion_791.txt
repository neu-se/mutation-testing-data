  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `null` instead of being rejected with the original error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Custom error message"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a custom error message instead of being rejected with the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return Q.reject(new Error("Custom error message")); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a custom error message instead of being rejected with the original error, and it would also return a new rejected promise instead of the original one.

DONE.
