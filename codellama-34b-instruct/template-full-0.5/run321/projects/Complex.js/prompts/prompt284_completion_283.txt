  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `a`, which could potentially cause the `cos` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function would be called with a different argument than `a`, which could potentially cause it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the mathematical constant pi, which is approximately equal to 3.14159. Using this constant instead of `a` would cause the `cos` function to return a different result, as the `cos` function is defined as `cos(x) = 1` when `x` is equal to `Math.PI`.
