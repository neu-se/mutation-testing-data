Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isPending` function to always return `false`, as a string is not a promise, thus failing to check the actual state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would lead to a situation where `isPending` would return `false`, as `null` is not a promise, which would incorrectly indicate that the promise is not pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would also cause `isPending` to return `false`, as `undefined` is not a promise, leading to incorrect handling of promise states.

DONE.
