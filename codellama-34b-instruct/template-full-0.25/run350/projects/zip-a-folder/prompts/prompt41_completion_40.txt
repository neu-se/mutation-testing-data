  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method uses the specified separator to split the string into an array of substrings. Using a different separator, such as `'|'`, would produce a different array of substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method uses the specified separator to split the string into an array of substrings. Using a different separator, such as `';'`, would produce a different array of substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method uses the specified separator to split the string into an array of substrings. Using a different separator, such as `' '`, would produce a different array of substrings.

DONE.
