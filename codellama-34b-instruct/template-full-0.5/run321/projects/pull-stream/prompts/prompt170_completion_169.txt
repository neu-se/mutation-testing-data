  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with the value `true`, while the new code fragment `cb(false)` would call the callback function with the value `false`, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, array[i++])` would call the callback function with the value `array[i++]`, while the new code fragment `cb(null, array[i++] + 1)` would call the callback function with the value `array[i++] + 1`, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, array[i++
