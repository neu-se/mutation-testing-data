  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()) + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one more character than the original code, potentially causing the `otherIter.peekType()` to return a different value and leading to a different execution path.

DONE.
