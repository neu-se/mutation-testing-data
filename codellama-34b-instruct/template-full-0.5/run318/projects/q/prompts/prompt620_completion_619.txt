  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with the `set` operation, which would set the property `key` to `value` on the object `object`, whereas the original code would call the `dispatch` method with the `set` operation and return a promise for the return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with the `get` operation, which would get the property `key` from the object `object`, whereas the original code would call the `dispatch` method with the `set` operation and return a promise for the return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with the `delete` operation,
