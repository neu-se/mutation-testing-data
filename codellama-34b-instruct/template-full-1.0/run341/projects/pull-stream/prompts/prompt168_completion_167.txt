  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment in the `abortCb` function was `onAbort`, which refers to the `onAbort` function passed as an argument to the `values` function. Replacing this with `null` would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a `null` value for the `onAbort` argument, which could cause errors if the function relies on this argument to perform its intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment in the `abortCb` function was `onAbort`, which refers to the `onAbort` function passed as an argument to the `values` function. Replacing this with `undefined` would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with an `undefined` value for the `onAbort` argument, which could cause errors if the function relies on this argument to perform its intended behavior.
