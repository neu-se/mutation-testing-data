  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property is not defined on the `op` object, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not defined on the `op` object, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is not defined on the `op` object, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
