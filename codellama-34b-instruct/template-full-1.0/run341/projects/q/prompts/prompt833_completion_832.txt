  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function in the `Promise.prototype` that is called when the promise is rejected, whereas `progress` is a function in the `Promise.prototype` that is used to observe the progress of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is a function in the `Promise.prototype` that is called when the promise is resolved, whereas `progress` is a function in the `Promise.prototype` that is used to observe the progress of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a function in the `Promise.prototype` that is used to notify the progress of the promise, whereas `progress` is a function in the `Promise.prototype` that is used to observe the progress of the promise.
