  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate, initialValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value of the accumulator would be different, which could affect the outcome of the reduction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate, initialValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value of the accumulator would be different, which could affect the outcome of the reduction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate, initialValue - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value of the accumulator would be different, which could affect the outcome of the reduction.

DONE.
