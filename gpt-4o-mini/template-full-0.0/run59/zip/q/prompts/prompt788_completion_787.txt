Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `null` instead of the original object, potentially leading to unexpected results in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `undefined`, which may cause downstream handlers to behave incorrectly, as they expect a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the string `"error"` instead of the original object, which could lead to type errors or incorrect handling in subsequent promise operations.

DONE.
