This would result in different behavior because the `?.` operator is used to access the `customWriteStream` property of `zipAFolderOptions`, which is an optional property. If `zipAFolderOptions` is `undefined`, the expression will evaluate to `undefined` instead of throwing a `TypeError`.

This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used to check if `zipAFolderOptions` is truthy before accessing the `customWriteStream` property. If `zipAFolderOptions` is `undefined`, the expression will evaluate to `undefined` instead of throwing a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions || zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used to check if `zipAFolderOptions
