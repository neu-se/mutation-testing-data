  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Error.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `Object.prototype.toString` which returns a string representation of the object, while `Error.prototype.toString` is used to convert an error object to a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `Object.prototype.toString` which returns a string representation of the object, while `Array.prototype.toString` returns a string representing the elements of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"[Object object]".toString
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `Object.prototype.toString` which returns a string representation of the object, while this replacement would always return the string `"[Object object]"` regardless of the input object.

DONE.
