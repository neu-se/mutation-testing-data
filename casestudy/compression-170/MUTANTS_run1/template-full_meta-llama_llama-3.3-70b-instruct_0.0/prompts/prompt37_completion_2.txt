Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.writeHeader
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeHeader` is not a standard method in Node.js, unlike `writeHead`, which is used to send the HTTP headers to the client, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.writeHead.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of the `writeHead` method call, potentially affecting how the headers are sent, although in this specific case, it might not have a noticeable effect since `this` and `res` seem to be the same object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.flushHeaders
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushHeaders` is not a standard method for the response object in Node.js, unlike `writeHead`, which is used to send the HTTP headers, potentially causing the response to be sent without the headers being properly set.

DONE.
