Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `normalizedUrl` which has undergone some transformations to handle Windows paths and escape sequences, whereas using `url` directly would bypass these transformations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unescape(url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `unescape` on `normalizedUrl`, but using `unescape` on the original `url` would apply the unescaping transformations to the original string, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
decodeURI(normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `unescape` on `normalizedUrl`, whereas using `decodeURI` would apply a different decoding transformation, potentially leading to different results due to the differences in how these functions handle certain characters and escape sequences.

DONE.
