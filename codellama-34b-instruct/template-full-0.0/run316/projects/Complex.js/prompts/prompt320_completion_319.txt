  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which multiplies the imaginary part of the complex number by 2, while `2 * a` multiplies the real part by 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which multiplies the imaginary part of the complex number by 2, while `b * b` squares the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which multiplies the imaginary part of the complex number by 2, while `a + b` adds the real and imaginary parts.

DONE.
