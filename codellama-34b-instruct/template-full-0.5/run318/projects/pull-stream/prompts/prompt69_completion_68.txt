  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of the `Error` object is not defined, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `Error` object is not defined, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property of the `Error` object is not defined, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
