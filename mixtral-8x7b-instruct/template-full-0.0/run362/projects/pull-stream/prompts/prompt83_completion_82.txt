 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` within the `read` function, potentially causing issues if the `read` function relies on the value of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read || function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior when `read` is falsy, potentially causing the function to continue executing when it should have stopped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `read` function immediately, rather than waiting for the `next` function to call it. This could cause issues if the `read` function is not designed to be called immediately.

DONE.
