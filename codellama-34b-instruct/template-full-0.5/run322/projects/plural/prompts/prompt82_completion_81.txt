  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mouses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "mouse" as "mice", while this code fragment adds it as "mouses".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "mouse" as "mouses", while this code fragment adds it as "mice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "mouse" as "mouses", while this code fragment adds it as "mice" using a different algorithm.

DONE.
