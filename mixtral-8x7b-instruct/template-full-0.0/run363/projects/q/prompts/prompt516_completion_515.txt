 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` method is used to handle errors, not to register callbacks like `then`. The original `promise.then` registers two callbacks, one for fulfillment and another for rejection, while `promise.catch` only registers a rejection handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new resolved promise and registers callbacks on it, instead of using the original promise. This might lead to different execution order or unintended behavior if the original promise's state has already been resolved or rejected before the new promise's callbacks are registered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => promise.then, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `promise.then` in a `setTimeout` with a delay of
