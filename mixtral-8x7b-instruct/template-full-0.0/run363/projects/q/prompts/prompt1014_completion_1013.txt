 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have one fewer element, which could cause `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs])` to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
