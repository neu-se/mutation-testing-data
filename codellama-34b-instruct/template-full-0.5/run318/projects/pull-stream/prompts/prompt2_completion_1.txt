  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first element of the `sources` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the length of the `sources` array, rather than the actual elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources[Math.random() * sources.length]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select an element from the `sources` array, rather than considering the entire array.

DONE.
