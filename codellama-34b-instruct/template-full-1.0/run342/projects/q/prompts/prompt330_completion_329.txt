  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` expects an Error object as its argument, and passing `null` would result in an uncaught error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("Some other error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because a different error message would be thrown, and the fact that the error is passed to `reject` would still result in the promise being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error(exception))
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be wrapped in a new Error object, and the fact that `return` is used would result in the function returning the rejected promise, rather than the original code fragment which would simply throw the error.

DONE.
