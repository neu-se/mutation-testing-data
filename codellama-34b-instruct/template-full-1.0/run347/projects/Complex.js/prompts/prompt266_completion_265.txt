  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code swapped the values of `a` and `b`, but this new code would keep `b` as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the current value of `a` as the second argument, but this new code would calculate a new value using `a + b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the current value of `b` as the first argument, but this new code would calculate a new value using `a + b`.

DONE.
