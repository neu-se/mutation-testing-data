  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0 && z['re'] > 0 && z['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z['im'] >= 0`, while this new code fragment checks if `z['im'] > 0`. This means that if `z['im']` is equal to zero, the original code fragment would return `Complex['ZERO']`, while this new code fragment would return `Complex['ONE']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0 && z['re'] > 0 && z['im'] < 0
