  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the first element of the `attempt3` array, whereas the original code fragment checks all elements of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the second element of the `attempt3` array, whereas the original code fragment checks all elements of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the third element of the `attempt3` array, whereas the original code fragment checks all elements of the array.

DONE.
