  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to always return a resolved promise with the value `1`, regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to always return a resolved promise with the value `null`, regardless of the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to always return a resolved promise with the value `undefined`, regardless of the input value.

DONE.
