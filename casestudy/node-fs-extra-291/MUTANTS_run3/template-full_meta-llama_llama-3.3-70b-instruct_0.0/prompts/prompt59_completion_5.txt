Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be treated as a literal string '$$' instead of an escaped '$' character, potentially leading to incorrect path replacements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would use the entire targetPath instead of just the '$' character, potentially causing incorrect path constructions and errors during file operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be an empty string, effectively removing the '$' character from the path replacement, potentially leading to incorrect file paths and errors during file operations.

DONE.
