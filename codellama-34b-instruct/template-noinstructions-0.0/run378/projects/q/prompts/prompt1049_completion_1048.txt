  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if `error` is not defined, while the new code fragment would simply return `null` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if `error` is not defined, while the new code fragment would simply return `undefined` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Custom error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error with a specific message if `error` is not defined, while the new code fragment would throw a different error with a custom message.

DONE.
