  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is not being called on the `tester` object, which is likely to cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with an additional argument, which is likely to cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data, function(data) { return data; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with a different argument, which is likely to cause the test to fail.

DONE.
