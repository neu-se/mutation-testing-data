  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator reverses the truthiness of the `rejected` variable, and the conditional expression would always evaluate to `true` in this case, regardless of whether `rejected` is a function or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator performs a strict type check, and the conditional expression would only be satisfied if `rejected` is not a function, even if it is a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof fulfilled === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks the type of the `fulfilled` variable, rather than the `rejected` variable, and the conditional expression would only be satisfied if `fulfilled` is a function, even if `rejected` is also a function.
