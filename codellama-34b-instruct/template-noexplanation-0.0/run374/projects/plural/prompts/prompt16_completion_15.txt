  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This change will cause the code to return the wrong plural form for words that end in "y" and are not preceded by a vowel. For example, "city" will be pluralized as "citys" instead of "cities".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This change will cause the code to return the wrong plural form for words that end in "y" and are preceded by a vowel. For example, "honey" will be pluralized as "honeys" instead of "honeys".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This change will cause the code to return the wrong plural form for words that end in "y" and are preceded by a vowel. For example, "baby" will be pluralized as "babys" instead of "babies".
