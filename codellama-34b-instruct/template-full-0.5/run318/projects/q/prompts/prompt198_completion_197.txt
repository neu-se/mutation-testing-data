  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is falsy, which includes `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN`, and empty strings. However, this replacement code fragment only checks for `null` specifically, which could lead to different outcomes if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an empty string or another falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof fileNameAndLineNumber === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is falsy, which includes `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN`, and empty strings. However, this replacement code fragment only checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is undefined specifically, which could lead to different outcomes if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is `null`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
