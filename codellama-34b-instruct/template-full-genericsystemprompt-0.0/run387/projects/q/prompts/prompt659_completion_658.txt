  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different slice of the `arguments` array, which would affect the `dispatch` method's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different slice of the `args` array, which would affect the `dispatch` method's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[], 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, which would affect the `dispatch` method's behavior.

DONE.
