  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will invert the truthiness of the `ended` variable, causing the function to return a callback when it would have previously returned `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable will be set to `true` regardless of its previous value, causing the function to return a callback when it would have previously returned `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, not identity, so the function will return a callback even if the `ended` variable is set to a truthy value, as long as it is not set to the exact same object as the `null` value.

DONE.
