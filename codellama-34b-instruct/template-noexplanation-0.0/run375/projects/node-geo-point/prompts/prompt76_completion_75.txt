  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360
```
This will generate a random bearing between 0 and 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.random() * 2 - 1) * 360
```
This will generate a random bearing between -360 and 360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * 360)
```
This will generate a random bearing between 0 and 359 degrees.

DONE.
