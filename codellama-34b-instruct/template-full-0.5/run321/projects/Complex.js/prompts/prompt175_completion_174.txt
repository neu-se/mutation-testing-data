  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < d
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(c)` is always non-negative, while `c` can be negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) <= Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different comparison operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) == Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different comparison operator.

DONE.
