  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `fail` method to be called with a different object than the one that was passed to `deferred.reject`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat([])` creates a new array that is a concatenation of `nodeArgs` and an empty array, which would cause the `fail` method to be called with a different object than the one that was passed to `deferred.reject`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.splice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice(0)` removes the first element of the `nodeArgs` array and returns it as a new array, which would cause the `fail` method to be called with a different object
