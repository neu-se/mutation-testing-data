  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next` is a function that returns the next element in the iterator, while `this.next()` calls the function and returns the result of the function, which may be different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the current `this` context, while `this.next` is a function that is not bound to any context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next.call(this)` calls the `next` function with the current `this` context, while `this.next` is a function that is not called with any context.

DONE.
