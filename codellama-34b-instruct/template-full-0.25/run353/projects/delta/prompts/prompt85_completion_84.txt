  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `isEqual` function to return `false` when comparing it with the `lastOp.attributes` property, even if they are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { foo: 'bar' };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object would be set to a new object with a `foo` property set to `'bar'`, which would cause the `isEqual` function to return `false` when comparing it with the `lastOp.attributes` property, even if they are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object would be set to
