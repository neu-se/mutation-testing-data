  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = options;
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries[id] = options` would assign the `options` object to the `countries[id]` property, while the original code fragment `countries[id], options` would retrieve the `options` property of the `countries[id]` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country = countries[id];
country.timezones = country.timezones || [];
country.timezones.push(getTimezone(tzName));
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code would create a new `timezones` array and push the result of `getTimezone(tzName)` to it, while the original code would retrieve the `timezones` property of the `countries[id]` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const country = getCountry(id);
country.timezones = country.timez
