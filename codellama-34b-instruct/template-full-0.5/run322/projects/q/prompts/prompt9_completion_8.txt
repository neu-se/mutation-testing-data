  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& false` would cause the condition to always be false, regardless of the value of `define.amd`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& true` would cause the condition to always be true, regardless of the value of `define.amd`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && typeof define.amd.amd === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& typeof define.amd.amd === "function"` would cause the condition to only be true if `define.amd.amd` is a function, which would be different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
