  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method returns `true` if the string includes the specified text, whereas the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the result, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.startsWith(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method returns `true` if the string starts with the specified text, whereas the original code fragment uses the `includes` method, which returns `true` if the string includes the specified text anywhere within it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.endsWith(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `endsWith` method returns `true` if the string ends with the specified text, whereas the original code fragment uses the `includes` method, which returns `true` if the string includes the specified text anywhere within
