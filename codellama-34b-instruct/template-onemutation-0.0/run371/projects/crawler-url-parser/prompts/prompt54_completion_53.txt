  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns a URL object, while `URL.format` returns a string representation of the URL. In the context of the code, `URL.parse` would cause the `currentUrlStr` variable to be assigned a URL object, which would likely cause errors when trying to use it as a string.
