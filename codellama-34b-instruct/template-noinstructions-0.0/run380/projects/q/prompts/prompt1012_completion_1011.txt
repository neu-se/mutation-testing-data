  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line, which is necessary to properly handle the nodeback argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line, which is necessary to properly handle the nodeback argument.
