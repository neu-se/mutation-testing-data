  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes && attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the `attributes` object to the `newOp` object if it is not null and has at least one property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes && attributes.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the `attributes` object to the `newOp` object if it is not null and has at least two properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes && attributes.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the `attributes` object to the `newOp` object if it is not null and has at least three properties.

DONE.
