  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejected callback would be ignored, and the promise would be resolved with the value returned by the fulfilled callback, or with the value undefined if the fulfilled callback is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled callback would be ignored, and the promise would be rejected with the value returned by the rejected callback, or with the value undefined if the rejected callback is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled callback would be ignored, and the promise would be resolved with the value undefined, even if the rejected callback is defined.

DONE.
