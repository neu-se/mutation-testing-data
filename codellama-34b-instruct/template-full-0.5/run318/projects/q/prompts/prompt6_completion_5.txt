  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "undefined" && typeof module === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the module to not be exported, which could break the functionality of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "function" && typeof module === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the module to be exported as a function, which could break the functionality of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the module to be exported as an object, which could break the functionality of the program.

DONE.
