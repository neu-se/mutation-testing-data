  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` context, which would cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to be called on a different object than the one it was originally called on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.apply(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a specific `this` context and arguments provided as an array, which would cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to be called on a different object than the one it was originally called on, and with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a specific `this` context and arguments provided individually, which would cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to be called on a
