  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current value of the iterator, rather than the next value as the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has a next value, rather than the next value as the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next two values of the iterator, rather than just the next value as the original code fragment does.

DONE.
