  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a callback function that is called when the `map` function is aborted, while `cb` is a callback function that is called when the `map` function is completed successfully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the `data` parameter of the `map` function, while `cb` is a callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value for the `data` parameter of the `map` function, while `cb` is a callback function.

DONE.
