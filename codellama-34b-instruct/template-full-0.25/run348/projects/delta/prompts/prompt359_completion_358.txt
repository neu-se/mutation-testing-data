  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, !priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `priority`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `priority` is `true`, leading to different execution paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, priority + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `priority` is `false`, leading to different execution paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, priority * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `priority` is `false`, leading to different execution paths.

DONE.
