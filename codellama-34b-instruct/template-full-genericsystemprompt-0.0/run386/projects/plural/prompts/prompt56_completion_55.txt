  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ves' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the string 'ves' with the string 's', resulting in the string 'vess', while the new code fragment would concatenate the string 'ves' with the string 's' and then add the string 's' again, resulting in the string 'vesss'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ves' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the string 'ves' with the string 's', resulting in the string 'vess', while the new code fragment would concatenate the string 'ves' with the string 'es', resulting in the string 'veses'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

'ves' + 'es' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the string 'ves' with the string 's', resulting in the string
