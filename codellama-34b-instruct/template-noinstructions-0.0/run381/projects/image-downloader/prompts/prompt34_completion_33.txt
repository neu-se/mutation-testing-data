  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called `res.resume()` with a callback function, while this new code fragment calls it without a callback function. This could cause the response data to not be consumed properly, leading to memory leaks or other issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called `res.resume()` with a callback function, while this new code fragment calls it with a null argument. This could cause the callback function to not be called, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called `res.resume()` with a callback function, while this new code fragment calls it with a different callback function. This could cause the callback function to be called with different arguments, leading to unexpected behavior
