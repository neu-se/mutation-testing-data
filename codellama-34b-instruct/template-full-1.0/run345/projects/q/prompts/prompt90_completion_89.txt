  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== uncurryThis
```
This would result in different behavior because `x !== uncurryThis` would always evaluate to `true`, even if `x` was equal to `uncurryThis`, which would cause the `if` statement to always execute the branch for when `x !== uncurryThis`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== Object.prototype.toString.call(uncurryThis)
```
This would result in different behavior because `x !== Object.prototype.toString.call(uncurryThis)` would always evaluate to `true`, even if `x` was equal to `Object.prototype.toString.call(uncurryThis)`, which would cause the `if` statement to always execute the branch for when `x !== uncurryThis`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== Object.prototype.toString.call(Object.prototype.toString)
```
This would result in different behavior because `x !== Object
