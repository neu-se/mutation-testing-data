  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream == 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator will coerce the `stream` variable to a string, so it will always evaluate to `false` unless the `stream` variable is a string that contains the word "object".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator will only evaluate to `true` if the `stream` variable is a string that contains the word "object" and has the same type as the string "object".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream instanceof 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator will only evaluate to `true` if the `stream` variable is an instance of the `Object` constructor, which is not the case for a string that contains the word "object".

DONE.
