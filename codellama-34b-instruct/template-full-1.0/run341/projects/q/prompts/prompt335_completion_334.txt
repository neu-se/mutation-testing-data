  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise object instead of a value, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 inspected.exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the exception object instead of a value, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 inspected.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the one returned by the original code fragment, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
