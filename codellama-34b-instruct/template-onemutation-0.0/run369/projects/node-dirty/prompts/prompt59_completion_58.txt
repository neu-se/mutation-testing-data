  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `close` method with no arguments, while the new code fragment calls it with `this._writeStream` as an argument. This could potentially cause the `close` method to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

DONE.
