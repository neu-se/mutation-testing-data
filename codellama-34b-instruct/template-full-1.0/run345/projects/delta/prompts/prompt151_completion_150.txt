  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.delete - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because `firstOther.delete` is not defined in the original code, so it would return `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOther.delete - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOther` is not defined in the original code, so it would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstOther.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the `delete` property from the `retain` property, which is not part of the original code.

DONE.
