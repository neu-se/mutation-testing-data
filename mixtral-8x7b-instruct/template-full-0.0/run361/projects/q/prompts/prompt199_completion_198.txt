 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would always attempt to capture the line, even if the environment does not support stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof hasStacks === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the environment as if it doesn't support stack traces, even if it actually does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the `hasStacks` variable as null, which could potentially cause a `TypeError` if the `captureLine` function is called.

DONE.
