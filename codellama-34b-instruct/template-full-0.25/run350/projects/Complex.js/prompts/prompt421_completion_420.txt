  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite, whereas `isZero` checks if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, whereas `isZero` checks if both the real and imaginary parts are zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both the real and imaginary parts are zero, whereas `isZero` only checks if the real part is zero.

DONE.
