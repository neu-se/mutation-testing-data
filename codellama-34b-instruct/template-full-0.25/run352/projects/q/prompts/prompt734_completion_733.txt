  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `promises` is an array of promises, while `[]` is an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `promises` is an array of promises, while `[null]` is an array with a single element that is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `promises` is an array of promises, while `[undefined]` is an array with a single element that is undefined.

DONE.
