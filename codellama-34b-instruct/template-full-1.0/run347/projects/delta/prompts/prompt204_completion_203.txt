  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest();
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest()` returns a new iterator starting from the current position, whereas `rest` would return the remaining ops in the current iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest();
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.rest()` returns a new iterator starting from the current position, whereas `rest` would return the remaining ops in the current iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops;
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops` returns a reference to the underlying array of ops in the current iterator, whereas `rest` would return a new array containing the remaining ops.

DONE.
