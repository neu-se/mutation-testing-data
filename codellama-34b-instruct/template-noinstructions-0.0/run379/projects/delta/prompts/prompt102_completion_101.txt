  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas the original code fragment uses `pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` which is a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop(1)` removes the last element of an array and returns it, whereas the original code fragment uses `pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` which is a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop(this.ops.length - 1)` removes the last element of an array and returns it, whereas the original code fragment uses `pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` which is a syntax error.

DONE.
