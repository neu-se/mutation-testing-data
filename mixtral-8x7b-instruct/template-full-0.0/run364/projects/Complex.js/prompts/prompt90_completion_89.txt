 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'-' + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator is used instead of the conditional (ternary) operator, always adding a negative sign to the next token, even if `minus` is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
minus ? '-' : '+', tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the `minus` variable's boolean value with the string `'+'` and `tokens[i + 1]`, instead of using the conditional (ternary) operator to decide whether to add a negative sign or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sign(minus) * tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.sign()` function to convert the `minus` variable to -1 or 1
