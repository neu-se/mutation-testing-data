 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.includes()` is not supported in older browsers, and it might not work as expected if the polyfill is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.some(p => p === promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.some()` is not supported in older browsers, and it might not work as expected if the polyfill is not provided. Additionally, it introduces a new variable `p` which could lead to confusion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.filter(p => p === promise).length > 0
