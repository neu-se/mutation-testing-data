  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function expects a non-zero value for the base, but `0` is a valid value for the exponent. The resulting value would be `1`, which would cause the `floor` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function expects a positive value for the base, but `-1` is a negative value. The resulting value would be `-1`, which would cause the `floor` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would return a different result for the exponent of `100`. The resulting value would be `10000`, which would cause the `floor` function to return a different result.

DONE.
