  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the key from the `_data` map, while this replacement code fragment deletes the value associated with the key from the `_data` map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the key from the `_data` map, while this replacement code fragment sets the value associated with the key to `undefined` in the `_data` map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the key from the `_data` map, while this replacement code fragment sets the value associated with the key to `null` in the `_data` map.

DONE.
