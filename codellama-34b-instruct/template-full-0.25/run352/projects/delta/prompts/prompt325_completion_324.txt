  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to start at the wrong index, potentially returning the wrong data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to start at the wrong index and have the wrong length, potentially returning the wrong data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length, baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to have a length of 0, potentially returning no data.

DONE.
