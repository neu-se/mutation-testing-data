  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a tuple of two strings, while the new code fragment is a single string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has the word "chillies" with an "s" at the end, while the new code fragment has the word "chillis" with an "is" at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has the word "chillies" with an "s" at the end, while the new code fragment has the word "chillies" with an "ies" at the end.

DONE.
