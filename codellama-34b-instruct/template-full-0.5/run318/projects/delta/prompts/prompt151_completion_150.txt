  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.delete - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different property than `retain` and would cause the code to behave differently when the `other` delta has a `delete` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to behave differently when the `other` delta has a `retain` operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain * firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to behave differently when the `other` delta has a `retain` operation and the `firstLeft` variable is not 0.

DONE.
