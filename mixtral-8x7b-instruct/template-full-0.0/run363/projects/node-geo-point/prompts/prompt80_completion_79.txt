 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operation converts the longitude value to a number, but it doesn't apply the correct radian conversion factor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.PI / coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the longitude value in the denominator instead of the numerator, which would lead to incorrect radian conversion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(coordinate.longitude)
