  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 && b < 3600
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code, which is intended to test the robustness of the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 && b < 3000 && c < 3000
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code, which is intended to test the robustness of the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 && b < 3000 && c < 3000 && d < 3000
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code, which is intended to test the robustness of the test suite.

DONE.
