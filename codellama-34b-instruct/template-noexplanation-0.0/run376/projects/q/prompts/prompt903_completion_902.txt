  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This will cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This will cause the promise to be notified instead of rejected, which is a different behavior than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This will cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null`, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
