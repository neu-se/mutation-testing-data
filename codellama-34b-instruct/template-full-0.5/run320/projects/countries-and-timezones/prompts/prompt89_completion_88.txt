  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is always set to `true`, regardless of whether the `options` object has a `deprecated` property or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is always set to `false`, regardless of whether the `options` object has a `deprecated` property or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is inverted, regardless of whether the `options` object has a `deprecated` property or not.

DONE.
