  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `f.bind(this)` would create a new function with `this` bound to the current context, whereas `f` would be called with the original context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `f.call(this)` would call `f` with `this` as the context, whereas `f` would be called with the original context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `f.apply(this)` would call `f` with `this` as the context and an empty argument list, whereas `f` would be called with the original context and the original argument list.

DONE.
