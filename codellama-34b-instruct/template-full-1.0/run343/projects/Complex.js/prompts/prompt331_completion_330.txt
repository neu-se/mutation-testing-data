  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a == 0` is a comparison operator that checks if `a` is equal to 0, whereas `a === 0` is a comparison operator that checks if `a` is equal to 0 and has the same type as 0. In this case, if `a` is 0, the buggy code fragment would evaluate to true, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to false because 0 is not equal to 0 with the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a != 0` is a comparison operator that checks if `a` is not equal to 0, whereas `a === 0` is a comparison operator that checks if `a` is equal to 0 with the same type as 0. In this case, if `a` is not 0, the buggy code fragment would evaluate to true, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to false
