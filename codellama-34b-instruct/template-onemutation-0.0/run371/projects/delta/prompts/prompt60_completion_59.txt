  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'number' && arg === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a string and has a length of 0, while the new code fragment checks if the argument is a number and has a value of 0. These checks are not equivalent, and the new code fragment may produce different results in certain cases.

DONE.
