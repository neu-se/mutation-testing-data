  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` variable would be set to 0, which would allow the regex to match empty strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` variable would be set to -1, which would allow the regex to match negative numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` variable would be set to Infinity, which would allow the regex to match any number of characters.

DONE.
