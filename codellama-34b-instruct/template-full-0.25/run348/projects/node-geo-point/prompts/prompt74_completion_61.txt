  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, whereas `deg2rad` converts degrees to radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different formula to convert radians to degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 360 / (2 * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different formula to convert radians to degrees.

DONE.
