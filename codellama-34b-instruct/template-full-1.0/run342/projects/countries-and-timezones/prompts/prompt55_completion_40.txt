  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{...options, deprecated: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new object created with the spread operator would have a `deprecated` property set to `true`, which would cause `deliverTimezones` to return all timezones, even the deprecated ones, as it would not filter them out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{...options, timezone: 'INVALID_TIMEZONE'}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new object created with the spread operator would have a `timezone` property set to an invalid timezone string, which would cause `getTimezone` to return `null`, as it would not find a matching timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{...options, countryId: 'INVALID_COUNTRY_ID'}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new object created with the spread operator would have a `countryId` property set to an invalid country ID string,
