Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the variable used in the sine function from the imaginary part `b` to the real part `a`, which would lead to incorrect calculations of the sine component of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the sine of the imaginary part `b` with the cosine of `b`, which fundamentally alters the output of the complex exponential function, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the imaginary part `b` with `0`, effectively ignoring the contribution of the imaginary component in the sine calculation, which would yield an incorrect complex number.

DONE.
