  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `a`, which could cause the `atan` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-a` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `a`, which could cause the `atan` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `a`, which could cause the `atan` function to return a different value.

DONE.
