  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<PLACEHOLDER> === thisIter.peekLength()</code> 

This would result in different behavior because the peekLength method returns the total length of all operations in the iterator, not the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<PLACEHOLDER> === thisOp.length</code>

This would result in different behavior because the length property is not defined for all operations and may not always return the same value as peekLength.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<PLACEHOLDER> === otherOp.length</code>

This would result in different behavior because the length property may not be defined for all operations and may not always return the same value as peekLength.

DONE.
