  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a` and `_b` are different variables, and `_a` may have a different value than `_b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `_b` would change the result of the logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a + _b
```
This would result in different behavior because adding `_a` and `_b` together would change the result of the logarithm.

DONE.
