 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `retain` would become `null` instead of the `attributes` object, which could cause issues if the code downstream relies on the `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `retain` would become an empty object, which might not cause immediate issues, but could lead to unexpected behavior if the code downstream relies on specific attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(<any>thisOp.attributes).concat(<any>otherOp.attributes)
