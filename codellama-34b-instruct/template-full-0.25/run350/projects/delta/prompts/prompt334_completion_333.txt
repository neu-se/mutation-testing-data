  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `AttributeMap.invert` method would receive a `null` value as the `baseOp.attributes` argument, which would cause it to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `attributes` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `AttributeMap.invert` method would receive an `undefined` value as the `baseOp.attributes` argument, which would cause it to return an empty object `{}` instead of the expected inverted attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `AttributeMap.invert` method would receive an empty object `{}` as the `baseOp.attributes` argument, which would cause it to return an empty object `{}` instead of the expected inverted attributes.

DONE.
