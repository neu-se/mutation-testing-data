  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operator `++` is replaced with the decrement operator `--`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operator `++` is replaced with a different operation that adds 2 to the value of `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
j
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `j` is being used instead of `i`.

DONE.
