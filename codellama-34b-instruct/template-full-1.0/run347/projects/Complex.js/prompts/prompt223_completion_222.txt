  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b;
``` 
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the square root operation to the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment applied the square root operation to the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*b;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the square root operation to the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment applied the square root operation to the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the square root operation to the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment applied the square root operation to the absolute value of the complex number.

DONE.
