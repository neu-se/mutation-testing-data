  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `mul` method to return `Complex['NAN']` when the base is infinite and the exponent is zero, which is not the correct result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) || (this['isZero']() && z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `mul` method to return `Complex['NAN']` when both the base and the exponent are infinite or zero, which is not the correct result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) || (this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']())
```
