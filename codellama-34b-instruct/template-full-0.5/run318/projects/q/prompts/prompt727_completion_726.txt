  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would not wait for all promises to be resolved before resolving the returned promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would resolve the returned promise immediately, even if there were still pending promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would not wait for all promises to be resolved before resolving the returned promise, and would also resolve the returned promise immediately if there were no pending promises.

DONE.
