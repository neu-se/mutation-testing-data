  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `a`, which is not the same as taking the cosine of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` and `b`, rather than taking the cosine of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `a` and `b`, rather than taking the cosine of `a`.

DONE.
