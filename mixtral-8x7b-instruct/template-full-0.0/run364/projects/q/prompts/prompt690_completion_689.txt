 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method would return an empty array instead of using the provided arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method would pass the raw `arguments` object instead of an array of arguments, which may cause issues with functions expecting an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method would pass the current context (`this`) instead of an array of arguments, which may cause issues with functions expecting an array of arguments.

DONE.
