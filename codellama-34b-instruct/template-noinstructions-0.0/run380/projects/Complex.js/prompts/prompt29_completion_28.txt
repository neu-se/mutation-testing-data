  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a single variable, while `a + b` is an expression that adds two variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a single variable, while `a * b` is an expression that multiplies two variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a single variable, while `a / b` is an expression that divides two variables.

DONE.
