  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `while` loop to iterate one more time than it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `while` loop to iterate one fewer time than it should, potentially leading to the loop being skipped entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `while` loop to iterate twice as many times as it should, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
