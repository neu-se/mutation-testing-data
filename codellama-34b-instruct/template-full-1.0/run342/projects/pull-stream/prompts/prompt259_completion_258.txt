  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(function(err, stream) {
  //...
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextStream` function is not called with the correct arguments. The original code fragment calls `nextStream` with two arguments: `null` and a callback function, whereas the modified code fragment calls it with a single argument: a callback function. This would cause the `nextStream` function to behave differently than expected, potentially leading to errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(false, function(err, stream) {
  //...
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextStream` function is called with a different set of arguments. In the original code fragment, the function is called with `null` and a callback function, whereas in the modified code fragment, it is called with `false` and a callback function. This would cause the `nextStream` function to behave differently than expected, potentially leading to errors in the code.

Option 3: The
