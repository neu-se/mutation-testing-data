  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This change will cause the `once` function to always return `null` when `abort` is `true`, which is the opposite of the original behavior. This change will likely cause some tests to fail, as it changes the expected behavior of the `once` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : null
```
This change will cause the `once` function to always return `null`, regardless of the value of `abort`. This change will likely cause some tests to fail, as it changes the expected behavior of the `once` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

abort === false ? null : abort
