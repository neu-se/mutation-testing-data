  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n").reverse().join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the stack traces, which could potentially change the order in which the stack traces are displayed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n").slice(1).join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first stack trace from the concatenated stack traces, which could potentially change the order in which the stack traces are displayed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n").slice(-1).join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all but the last stack trace from the concatenated stack traces, which could potentially change the order in which the stack traces are displayed.

DONE.
