  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method of the `handler` object is called with the `thisData` and `otherData` objects as arguments, which could result in different behavior depending on the implementation of the `transform` method.
