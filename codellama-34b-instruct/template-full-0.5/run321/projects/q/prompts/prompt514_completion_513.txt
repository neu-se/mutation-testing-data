  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.when(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `when` method on the `defer` object, which returns a promise that is resolved when the `defer` object is resolved or rejected. In contrast, the new code fragment uses the `when` method on the `rejected` object, which returns a promise that is resolved when the `rejected` object is resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.when(resolved)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `when` method on the `defer` object, which returns a promise that is resolved when the `defer` object is resolved or rejected. In contrast, the new code fragment uses the `when` method on the `resolved` object, which returns a promise that is resolved when the `resolved` object is resolved or rejected.
