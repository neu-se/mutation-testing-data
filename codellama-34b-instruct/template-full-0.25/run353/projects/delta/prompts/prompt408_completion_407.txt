  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `chop` is a method that removes an element from the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a method that removes an element from the end of an array, whereas `chop` is a method that removes an element from the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` is a method that removes an element from the beginning of an array, whereas `chop` is a method that removes an element from the end of an array.

DONE.
