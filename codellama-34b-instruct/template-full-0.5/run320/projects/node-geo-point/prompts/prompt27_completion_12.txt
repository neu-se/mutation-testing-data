  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude value of the second point instead of the first point, which could cause the calculation to be off.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value of the first point instead of the latitude value, which could cause the calculation to be off.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value of the second point instead of the latitude value, which could cause the calculation to be off.

DONE.
