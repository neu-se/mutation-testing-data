  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countryId` parameter would be incremented by 1, which could cause the function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId - 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countryId` parameter would be decremented by 1, which could cause the function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId * 2, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countryId` parameter would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the function to return a different country than the one intended.

DONE.
