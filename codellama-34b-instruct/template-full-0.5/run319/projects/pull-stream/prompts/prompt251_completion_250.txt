  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `_read` function would be `null`, which would cause the function to return early without reading any data from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to the `_read` function would be `null`, which would cause the function to return early without reading any data from the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `_read` function would be `abort`, which would cause the function to return early without reading any data from the stream.

DONE.
