  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value, instead of being resolved with the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value, but then rejected with the result of the `reject` function, which is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function () {
    throw new Error("test");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value, but then rejected with an error.

DONE.
