  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.resolve` returns the absolute path of the given path, while `path.join` returns the concatenation of two or more paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of the given path, while `path.join` returns the concatenation of two or more paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of the given path, while `path.join` returns the concatenation of two or more paths.

DONE.
