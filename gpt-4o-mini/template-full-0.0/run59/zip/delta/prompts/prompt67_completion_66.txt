Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent any new operation from being added to the `ops` array, effectively making the `delete` method a no-op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push({ delete: length + 1 });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increase the length of the delete operation by 1, leading to an unintended deletion of one extra character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift({ delete: length });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the delete operation to the beginning of the `ops` array instead of the end, changing the order of operations and potentially altering the final result of the operations.

DONE.
