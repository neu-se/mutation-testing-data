  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_splice` is a different method than `array_slice`, and it has a different purpose. `array_splice` modifies the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements, whereas `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different portion of the array. The original code fragment returns the first element of the array, whereas `array_slice(1)` would return the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different portion of the array. The original code fragment returns the first element of the array, whereas `array_slice(-1)` would return the last element.

DONE.
