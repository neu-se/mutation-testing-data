  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication order is reversed, which could produce a different result in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator is used instead of addition, which could produce a different result in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the result is multiplied by 2, which could produce a different result in some cases.

DONE.
