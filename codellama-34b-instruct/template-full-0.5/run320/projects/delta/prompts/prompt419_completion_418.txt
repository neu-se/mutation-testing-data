  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operation is not handled by the current code, and it would cause the code to skip over any `retain` operations in the `OpIterator`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to skip over any `insert` operations with a length of 0, which could result in incorrect behavior if the `OpIterator` contains such operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to skip over any `insert` operations with a negative length, which could result in incorrect behavior if the `OpIterator` contains such operations.

DONE.
