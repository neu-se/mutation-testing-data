  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `iter` object, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `otherIter` object, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `thisIter` object, which is not defined in the original code.

DONE.
