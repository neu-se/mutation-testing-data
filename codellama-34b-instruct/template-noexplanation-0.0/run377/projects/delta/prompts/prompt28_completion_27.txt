  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This change will cause the `invert` function to return a different result than expected, as it will invert the values of the `base` object instead of the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This change will cause the `invert` function to return a different result than expected, as it will invert the entries of the `base` object instead of the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.reverse()
```
This change will cause the `invert` function to return a different result than expected, as it will invert the keys of the `base` object in reverse order.

DONE.
