 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'different_function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function name is changed to `different_function`, which would cause a reference error in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty arrow function is assigned to the `type` property instead of the result of the `gettype` function. This would cause the `retArr` array to contain objects with an additional `type` property that is an empty function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
gettype.bind(null, linkurl, pageurl)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function is called immediately with the `linkurl` and `pageurl` arguments, and its return value is assigned to the `type` property. This would cause the `gettype` function to be called only once during the execution of the `
