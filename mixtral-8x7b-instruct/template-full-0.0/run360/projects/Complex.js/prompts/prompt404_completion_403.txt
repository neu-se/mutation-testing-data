 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1/2 instead of the correct imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return twice the original imaginary part, which is not equivalent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number between 0 and 1 instead of the correct imaginary part, making the result unpredictable.

DONE.
