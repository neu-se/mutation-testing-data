  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `a && (onEnd || !onEnd)`, which is always true if `onEnd` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a || onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(!a) || onEnd`, which is always true if `onEnd` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ? onEnd : !onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator `? :` has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `a ? onEnd : (!onEnd)`, which is always true if `onEnd` is truthy.
