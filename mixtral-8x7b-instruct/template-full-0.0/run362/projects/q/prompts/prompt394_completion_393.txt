 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would receive `null` as the first argument instead of the original `value`. This could cause issues if the `then` method is not designed to handle `null` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would receive the result of `value + 1` instead of the original `value`. This could cause issues if the `then` method is not designed to handle modified values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would receive the `value` property of the current object instead of the original `value`. This could cause issues if the current object does not have a `value` property or if the `value` property has a different value than the original `value`.

DONE.
