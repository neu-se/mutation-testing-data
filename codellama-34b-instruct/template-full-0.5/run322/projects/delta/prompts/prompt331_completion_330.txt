  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the attributes of the base operation, rather than the base operation itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the attributes of the other operation, rather than the base operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to return `null`, which would then be used to update the attributes of the inverted operation.

DONE.
