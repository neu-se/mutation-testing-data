  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the result of the `isFinite` function, causing the `isInfinite` function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, causing the `isInfinite` function to always return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN'](this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the imaginary part of the complex number, causing the `isInfinite` function to always return false for real numbers.

DONE.
