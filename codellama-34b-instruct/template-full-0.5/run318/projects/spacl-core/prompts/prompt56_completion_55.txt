  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[a-zA-Z0-9_]+/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all alphanumeric characters and underscores from the `part` string, whereas the original code fragment only removed the first occurrence of the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[a-zA-Z0-9_]+/, '*')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all alphanumeric characters and underscores with asterisks, whereas the original code fragment only removed the first occurrence of the pattern.
