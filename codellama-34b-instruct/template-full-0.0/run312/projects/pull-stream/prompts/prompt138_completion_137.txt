  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if `end` is truthy, while this new code fragment calls it regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate(end))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `generate` function with no arguments, while this new code fragment calls it with `end` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate(end, cb))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `generate` function with one argument, while this new code fragment calls it with two arguments.

DONE.
