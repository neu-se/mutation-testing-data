  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would return `null` if the input string does not end with a slash, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would return `undefined` if the input string does not end with a slash, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== spec.match(/^.+\/$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would return a different value if the input string ends with a slash, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` in that case.

DONE.
