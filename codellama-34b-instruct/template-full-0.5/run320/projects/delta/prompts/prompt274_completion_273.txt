  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be true, causing the `insert` operation to be pushed to the `delta` object, regardless of the type of the next operation in `thisIter`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be false, causing the `insert` operation to be skipped, regardless of the type of the next operation in `thisIter`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be true, causing the `insert` operation to be pushed to the `delta` object, regardless of the length of the next operation in `thisIter`.

DONE.
