  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the value of `i` after returning the value of `array[i]`, whereas the buggy code fragment increments the value of `i` before returning the value of `array[i]`. This could cause issues if the code relies on the value of `i` being incremented after the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the value of `i` after returning the value of `array[i]`, whereas the buggy code fragment decrements the value of `i` before returning the value of `array[i]`. This could cause issues if the code relies on the value of `i` being incremented after the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
