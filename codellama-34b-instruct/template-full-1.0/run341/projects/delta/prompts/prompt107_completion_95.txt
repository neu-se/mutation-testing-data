  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, whereas `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter()
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce()` applies a function to an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value, whereas `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

DONE.
