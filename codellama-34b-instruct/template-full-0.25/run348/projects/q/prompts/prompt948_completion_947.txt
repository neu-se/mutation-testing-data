  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `thisp` as the first argument to `makeNodeResolver`, which is the `this` context that the callback should be bound to. Passing `null` instead would cause the callback to be bound to the global object, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the callback references `this` inside the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `thisp` as the first argument to `makeNodeResolver`, which is the `this` context that the callback should be bound to. Passing `undefined` instead would cause the callback to be bound to the global object, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the callback references `this` inside the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred)
