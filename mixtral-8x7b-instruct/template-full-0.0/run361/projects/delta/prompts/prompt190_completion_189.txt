 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds elements to the beginning of an array, rather than the end using `push`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array, rather than creating a new one like `push` does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.length = 0; delta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because directly setting the `length` property to 0 removes all elements from the array, and then `push` adds a single element. This is different from the original `push` which adds an element to the existing array.

DONE.
