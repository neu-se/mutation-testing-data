  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeRejector
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeRejector` is a different method than `makeNodeResolver`, and it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the first argument to `makeNodeResolver` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null`, which is different from the original behavior where the promise is resolved with the value of the `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `deferred.promise` as the first argument to `makeNodeResolver` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `deferred.promise`, which is different from the original behavior where the promise is resolved with the
