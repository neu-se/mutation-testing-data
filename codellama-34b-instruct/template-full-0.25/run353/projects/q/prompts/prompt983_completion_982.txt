  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not being called on the promise returned by `this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs])`, which could cause the promise to be resolved even if an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not being called on the promise returned by `this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs])`, which could cause the promise to be resolved even if an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).catch(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not being called on the promise returned by `this.
