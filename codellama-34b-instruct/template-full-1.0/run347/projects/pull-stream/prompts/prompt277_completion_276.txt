  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function or a stream, but `null` is neither, which may cause the code to error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function or a stream, and it will allow the `nextStream` function to be called with the wrong set of arguments, which may cause the code to error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because `5` is not a function or a stream, and it will allow the `nextStream` function to be called with the wrong set of arguments, which may cause the code to error or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
