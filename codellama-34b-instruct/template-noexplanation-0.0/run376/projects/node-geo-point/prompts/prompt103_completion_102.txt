  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 180
```
This change will cause the longitude value to be offset by 180 degrees, which will result in a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 - 180
```
This change will cause the longitude value to be offset by -180 degrees, which will result in a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 * 2
```
This change will cause the longitude value to be doubled, which will result in a different destination point.

DONE.
