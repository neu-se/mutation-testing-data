 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rm` function would remove the key with a null value instead of actually removing the key from the `_data` Map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rm` function would set the value of the specified key to an empty object instead of removing the key from the `_data` Map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rm` function would set the value of the specified key to a function instead of removing the key from the `_data` Map.

DONE.
