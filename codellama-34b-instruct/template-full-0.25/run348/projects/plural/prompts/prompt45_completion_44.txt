  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the function body is different. The original code fragment uses a negative lookahead assertion to match words that end with "o" but not "oo", while the new code fragment uses a positive lookahead assertion to match words that end with "oo". Additionally, the function body in the new code fragment always returns "s" instead of "es" for words that end with "o".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the function body is different. The original code fragment uses a negative lookahead assertion to match words that end with "o" but not "oo",
