  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used to determine the base URL for the URL being parsed, and replacing it with `null` would cause the `parse` function to use the current URL as the base URL, which could result in different behavior if the current URL is different from the base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://www.example.com"
