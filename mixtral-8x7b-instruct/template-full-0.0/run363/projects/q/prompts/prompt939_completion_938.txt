 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseArgs.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array, while `concat` returns a new array without modifying the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` modifies the original array by adding elements to it, while `concat` returns a new array without modifying the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseArgs.sort
```
This would result in different behavior because `sort` modifies the original array by sorting its elements, while `concat` returns a new array without modifying the original array.

DONE.
