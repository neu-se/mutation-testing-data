  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to continue even if the next operation in `other` is an insertion, which would lead to an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to continue even if the next operation in `other` is a deletion, which would lead to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to continue even if the next operation in `other` is a retain, which would lead to an incorrect result.

DONE.
