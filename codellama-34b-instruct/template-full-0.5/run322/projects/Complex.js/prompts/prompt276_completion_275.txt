  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would be applied to the wrong input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would be applied to the wrong input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would be applied to the wrong input value.

DONE.
