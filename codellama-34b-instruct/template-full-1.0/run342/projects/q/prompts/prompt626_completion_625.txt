  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.dispatch` is a different method from `this.dispatch`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(null)` creates a new function with a different `this` context, which can cause errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is a different variable from `this.dispatch`, and it may not be defined in the current scope.

DONE.
