Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(data.slug || '').toString(), {transform: config.filename_case}
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the reference to `data.title`, potentially leading to an empty string being slugized if `data.slug` is also empty or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(data.title || data.slug).toString(), {transform: config.filename_case}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the variables being checked, potentially leading to different results if both `data.title` and `data.slug` are present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(data.slug && data.title).toString(), {transform: config.filename_case}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) instead of the OR operator (`||`), potentially leading to `null` or `undefined` being slugized if either `data.slug` or `data.title` is falsy.

DONE.
