  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked if `abort` is truthy, while this new fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `true`. This could cause the function to return a different value if `abort` is a truthy value other than `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked if `abort` is truthy, while this new fragment checks if it is not strictly equal to `true`. This could cause the function to return a different value if `abort` is a truthy value other than `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked if `abort` is truthy, while this new fragment checks if it is falsy. This could cause the function to return a different value if `abort
