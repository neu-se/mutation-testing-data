  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next()` method to be called for `otherIter` even if there are no more items in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next()` method to be called for `otherIter` even if there are no more items in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peek()` method to be called for `otherIter` instead of the `next()` method, which would lead to different code execution and potentially different behavior.

DONE.
