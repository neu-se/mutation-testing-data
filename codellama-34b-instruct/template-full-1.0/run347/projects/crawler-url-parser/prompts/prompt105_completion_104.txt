  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/;.*$/g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the href attribute's value with an empty string if it contains a semicolon, while the replacement code fragment does not modify the href attribute's value in any way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/;[^;]+$/g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the last semicolon and any characters that follow it with an empty string, while the replacement code fragment replaces any semicolon and the characters that follow it with an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/;/g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces all semicolons in the href attribute's value with empty strings, while the replacement code fragment replaces only the first semicolon it finds in the href attribute's
