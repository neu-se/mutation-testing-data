  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` parameter of the `URL.parse` method would be parsed differently. With the original code, the `search` parameter would be a string containing the query parameters separated by "&". With the modified code, the `search` parameter would be an array of key-value pairs representing the query parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"-"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pathname` parameter of the `URL.parse` method would be parsed differently. With the original code, the `pathname` parameter would be a string containing the path of the URL. With the modified code, the `pathname` parameter would be an array of strings representing the path segments of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"+"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` parameter of the `URL.parse` method would be parsed differently. With the original code
