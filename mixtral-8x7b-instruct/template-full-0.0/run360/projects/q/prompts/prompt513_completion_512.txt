 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method of the returned promise would return an empty array instead of the keys of the `value` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method would throw a `TypeError` since it expects an object as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
