  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, so it won't have properties to be accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, so it won't have properties to be accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ foo: 'bar' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` is replaced with an object that has the property `foo` with the value `'bar'`.

DONE.
