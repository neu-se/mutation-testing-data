Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `true` when `end` is `false`, causing the callback to be invoked with `true` instead of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it will pass `undefined` to the callback instead of the value of `end`, which may lead to unexpected results or errors in the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always pass `0` to the callback, regardless of the value of `end`, which could mislead the callback into interpreting it as a falsy value.

DONE.
