Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from a linear scaling of `b` to a constant addition, which will affect the denominator in the `csc` function, potentially leading to incorrect results for the cosecant of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the intended linear scaling of `b` with a quadratic term, which will significantly alter the value of the denominator, leading to incorrect results for the cosecant of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it mistakenly uses the real part `a` instead of the imaginary part `b`, which will fundamentally change the calculation of the cosecant, resulting in incorrect outputs for the complex number's cosecant.

DONE.
