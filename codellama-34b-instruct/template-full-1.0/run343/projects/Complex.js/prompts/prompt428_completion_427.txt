  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the || operator would return the right-hand operand if the left-hand operand is null or undefined, whereas the ||= operator would only return the right-hand operand if the left-hand operand is null or undefined and the variable has not been previously assigned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the || operator would return the right-hand operand if the left-hand operand is null or undefined, whereas the ||= operator would only return the right-hand operand if the left-hand operand is null or undefined and the variable has not been previously assigned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places = places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the places variable would be assigned the value 0 if it is null or undefined, and then used to calculate the result of the ceil function, whereas the
