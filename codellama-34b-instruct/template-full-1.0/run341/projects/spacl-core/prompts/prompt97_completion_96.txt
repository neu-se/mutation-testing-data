  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get = <NEWPOLICY>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the new policy instead of the original one, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get = <NOPOLICY>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would always return the same policy, even if it isn't the correct one, which could cause the code to behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get = <NULLPOLICY>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would always return null, even if a policy exists, which could cause the code to behave incorrectly.

DONE.
