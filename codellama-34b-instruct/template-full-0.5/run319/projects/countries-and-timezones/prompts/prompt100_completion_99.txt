  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the `tzs` object, while `tzs` by itself returns the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `tzs.length` returns the number of elements in the `tzs` array, while `Object.keys(tzs)` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the `tzs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs.filter(t => t.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tzs.filter(t => t.deprecated)` returns a new array containing only the elements of `tzs` that have a `deprecated` property set to `true`, while `Object.keys(tzs)` returns an array of strings representing all the keys of
