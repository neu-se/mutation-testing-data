  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error, which would be handled differently than the original behavior of using the `distance` variable as input to the `calculateDestination` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the `distance` variable before passing it to the `calculateDestination` function, which could produce different results if the function is not handling negative distances correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `distance` variable before passing it to the `calculateDestination` function, which could produce different results if the function is not handling positive distances correctly.

DONE.
