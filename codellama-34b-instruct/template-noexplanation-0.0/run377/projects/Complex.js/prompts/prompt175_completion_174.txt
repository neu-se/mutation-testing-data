  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < d
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the less-than operator instead of the greater-than operator. This change will cause the code to behave differently in certain cases, such as when `c` is negative and `d` is positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c <= d
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the less-than-or-equal-to operator instead of the greater-than operator. This change will cause the code to behave differently in certain cases, such as when `c` is negative and `d` is positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) <= Math.abs(d)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the less-than-or-equal-to operator instead of the greater-than operator. This change will cause the code to behave differently in certain cases, such as when `c` is
