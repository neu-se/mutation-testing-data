  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.push(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of `a` into the `current` array, rather than the `id` like the original code.

Option 2 : The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(tz);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `tz` object into the `all` array, rather than the `id` like the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.push(tz.r);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `r` property of the `tz` object into the `current` array, rather than the `id` like the original code.

DONE.
