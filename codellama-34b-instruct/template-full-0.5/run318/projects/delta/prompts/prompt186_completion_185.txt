  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `==` operator, which checks for both null and undefined, while the new code only checks for undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `==` operator, which checks for both null and undefined, while the new code only checks for null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `==` operator, which checks for both null and undefined, while the new code only checks for NaN.

DONE.
