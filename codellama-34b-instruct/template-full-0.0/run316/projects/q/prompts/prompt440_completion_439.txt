  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the reason is in the unhandledRejections array, rather than the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is in the reportedUnhandledRejections array, rather than the unhandledRejections array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is in the unhandledReasons array, rather than the unhandledRejections array.

DONE.
