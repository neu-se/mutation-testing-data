  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This code fragment will cause the `values` function to return the previous element in the array instead of the current element, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i+1])
```
This code fragment will cause the `values` function to return the next element in the array instead of the current element, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i*2])
```
This code fragment will cause the `values` function to return the current element multiplied by 2 instead of the current element, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
