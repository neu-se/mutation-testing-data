  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would be infinite, and the function would never exit.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate twice as fast, and the function would exit too early.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from a negative index, and the function would never exit.

DONE.
