 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['im'] + this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the sum of the imaginary parts is equal to zero, rather than checking if both are individually equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['im'] === this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary parts are equal, rather than checking if the imaginary part of z is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!z['im'] && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if z's imaginary part is not truthy and this's imaginary part is equal to zero, which is not the same as checking if both are individually equal to zero.

DONE.
