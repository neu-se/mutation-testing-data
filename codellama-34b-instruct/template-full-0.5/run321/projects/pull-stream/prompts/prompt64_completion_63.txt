  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback would not be called with an error if the `end` parameter is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback would not be called with an error if the `end` parameter is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback would be called with an error if the `end` parameter is `false`.

DONE.
