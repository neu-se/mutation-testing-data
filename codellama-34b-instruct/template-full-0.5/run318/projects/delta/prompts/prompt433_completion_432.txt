  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` is a method that returns the length of an operation, but `Op.length - 1` would return the length minus one, which could cause the iterator to skip over the last operation in the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` is a method that returns the length of an operation, but `Op.length + 1` would return the length plus one, which could cause the iterator to include an extra operation in the list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` is a method that returns the length of an operation, but `Op.length * 2` would return the length multiplied by two, which could cause the iterator to iterate over the operations twice as many times.
