  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because "next" is a valid method name in JavaScript, but it has a different meaning in the context of the code. It would cause the generator to move to the next iteration, rather than throwing an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because "yield" is a reserved word in JavaScript, and it would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because "return" is a reserved word in JavaScript, and it would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
