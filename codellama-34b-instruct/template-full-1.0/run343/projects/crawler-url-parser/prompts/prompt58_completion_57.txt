  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is the opposite of `true`, so it would stop the method from returning the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a truthy value, but it is not the same as `true`, so it would cause the method to return the wrong result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a string, and it is not a truthy value, so it would cause the method to return the wrong result.

DONE.
