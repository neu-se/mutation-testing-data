  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `op.retain` property is an object and not null, while the buggy code fragment checks if the `op.retain` property is an object and not null, but also checks if the `op.retain` property is not an empty object. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the `op.retain` property is an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null && Object.keys(op.retain).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `op.retain` property is an object and not null, while the buggy code fragment checks if the `op.retain` property is an object and not null, but also checks if the `op.retain` property has at least
