  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (promises) {
    return all(array_map(promises, function (promise) {
        return when(promise, noop, noop);
    }));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to be called on the resolved value of the promise, rather than on the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (promises) {
    return all(array_map(promises, function (promise) {
        return when(promise, noop, noop);
