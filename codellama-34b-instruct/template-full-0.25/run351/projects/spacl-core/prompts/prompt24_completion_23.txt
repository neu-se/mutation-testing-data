  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 1 || any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max > 1` check would cause the code to always return `true` when `max` is greater than 1, regardless of the value of `any`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max > 0` check would cause the code to always return `false` when `max` is 0 or less, regardless of the value of `any`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 || !any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!any` check would cause the code to always return `false` when `any` is `true`, regardless of the value of `max`.

DONE.
