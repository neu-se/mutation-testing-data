  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` would not account for the case where `country` is null or undefined, while `country == null` would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` would not account for the case where `country` is the string 'null', while `country === 'null'` would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof country === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` would not account for the case where `country` is undefined, while `typeof country === 'undefined'` would.

DONE.
