  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `value` property of the `source` object, which may not exist or have a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `promise` property of the `source` object, which may not exist or have a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `then` property of the `source` object, which may not exist or have a different value than the original code.

DONE.
