  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a different function than `_progressed`, and it would call the rejected callback instead of the progress callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a different value than `_progressed`, and it would skip the progress callback altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different value than `_progressed`, and it would call the progress callback with a different value than the original code would have.

DONE.
