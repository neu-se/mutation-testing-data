  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This change will cause the function to return the `sink` function instead of the anonymous function when `arguments.length` is less than 2, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 2
```
This change will cause the function to return the `sink` function instead of the anonymous function when `arguments.length` is greater than 2, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 3
```
This change will cause the function to return the `sink` function instead of the anonymous function when `arguments.length` is equal to 3, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
