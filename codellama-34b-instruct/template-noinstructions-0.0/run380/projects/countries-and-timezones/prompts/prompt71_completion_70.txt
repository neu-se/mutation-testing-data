  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with an additional argument, which could cause it to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
