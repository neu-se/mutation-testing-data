  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|infy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern was modified to include the word "infy" as a match for the rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|inference$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern was modified to include the word "inference" as a match for the rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$|(squirrel$|octupus$)/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
