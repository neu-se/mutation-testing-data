Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the condition to always evaluate to false, meaning the code would never return `Complex['NAN']` for the case of `Infinity - Infinity`, potentially leading to incorrect results in calculations involving infinite values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if the current complex number is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, which would incorrectly allow the operation to proceed without returning `Complex['NAN']` when both numbers are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the second complex number is zero instead of the first, which could lead to incorrect handling of the case where both numbers are infinite, as it would not return `Complex['NAN']` when it should.

DONE.
