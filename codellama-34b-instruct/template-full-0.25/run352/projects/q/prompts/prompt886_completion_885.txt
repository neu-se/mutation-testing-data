  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_slice` with the `arguments` object as its `this` value, which would cause it to return a new array containing all the arguments passed to the function, rather than just the arguments after the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_slice` with the `arguments` object as its first argument, which would cause it to return a new array containing all the arguments passed to the function, rather than just the arguments after the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_slice` with the `arguments` object as its first argument and `1` as its second argument, which would cause it to return
