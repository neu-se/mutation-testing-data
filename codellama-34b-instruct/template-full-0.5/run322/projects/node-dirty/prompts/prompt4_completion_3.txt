  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` will overwrite the existing value with `undefined`, whereas `delete` would remove the key-value pair altogether.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` will remove all key-value pairs from the map, whereas `delete` would only remove the specific key-value pair associated with `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` will overwrite the existing value with `null`, whereas `delete` would remove the key-value pair altogether.

DONE.
