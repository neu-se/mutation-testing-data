  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the destination point based on the input parameters, while this code fragment always returns the same point at (0, 0).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(coordinate.longitude, coordinate.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the destination point based on the input parameters, while this code fragment always returns the same point as the input coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(coordinate.latitude + bearing, coordinate.longitude + distance);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the destination point based on the input parameters, while this code fragment always returns a point that is offset from the input coordinate by the specified distance and bearing.

DONE.
