  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would replace it with a '#' character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would replace it with a '#' character followed by the current URL string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would replace it with a '#' character followed by the base URL string.

DONE.
