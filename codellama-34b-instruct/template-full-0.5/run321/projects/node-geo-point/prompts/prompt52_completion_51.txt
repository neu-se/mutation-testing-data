  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(θ)` computes the sine of `θ`, while `sin` computes the sine of the expression `θ`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(θ)` computes the cosine of `θ`, while `sin` computes the sine of the expression `θ`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan(θ)` computes the tangent of `θ`, while `sin` computes the sine of the expression `θ`.

DONE.
