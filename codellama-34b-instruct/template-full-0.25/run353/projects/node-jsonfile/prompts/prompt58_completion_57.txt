  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `EOL` variable, which is a newline character, to separate the lines in the stringified JSON object. Replacing it with a space character would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `EOL` variable to determine whether to include a newline character at the end of the stringified JSON object. Replacing it with `null` would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `EOL` variable to determine whether to include a newline character at the end of the stringified JSON object. Replacing it with a string containing a newline character would result in a different output.

DONE.
