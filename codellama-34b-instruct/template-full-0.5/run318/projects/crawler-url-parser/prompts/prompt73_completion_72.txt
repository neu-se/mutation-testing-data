  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is used for the URL of the image, while the `href` attribute is used for the URL of the link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `foo` string would be appended to the value of the `href` attribute, which would cause the link to point to a different URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' + '?' + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` character would be appended to the value of the `href` attribute, which would cause the link to point to a different URL with a query string.

DONE.
