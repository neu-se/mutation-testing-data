  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` returns the last element of the array, rather than the first element as `shift()` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` returns the first element of the array, rather than the last element as `pop()` does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of the array, rather than removing an element from the end of the array as `pop()` does.

DONE.
