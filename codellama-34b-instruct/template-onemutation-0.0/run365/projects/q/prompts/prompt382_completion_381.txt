  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the return value of the function it is called with, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value it is called with.
