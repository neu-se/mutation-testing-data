Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.options.tagValueProcessor(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `tagValueProcessor` function to the `val` variable, potentially modifying its value, instead of directly using the `val` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `val` variable to uppercase, potentially changing its value, instead of leaving it unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
attrStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `attrStr` variable, which contains attribute pairs, instead of the `val` variable, which contains the text value, potentially resulting in incorrect XML output.

DONE.
