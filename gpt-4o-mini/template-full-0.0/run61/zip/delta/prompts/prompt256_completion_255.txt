Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the `retain` properties of `thisOp` and `otherOp` instead of their `insert` properties, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations that should be treated as equal based on their inserted content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the equality check, causing the code to execute the `else` block when the `insert` properties are equal, which could lead to unintended consequences in the operation handling logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `thisOp.insert` is `null`, which would not consider the actual value of `otherOp.insert`, leading to a situation where operations are incorrectly treated as equal or not based solely on the presence of a value in `thisOp.insert`.

DONE.
