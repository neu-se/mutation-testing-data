  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i + 1` would cause the predicate to be called with a different index than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i - 1` would cause the predicate to be called with a different index than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i * 2` would cause the predicate to be called with a different index than the original code.

DONE.
