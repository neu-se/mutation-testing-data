Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes("(node.js:")
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks for the presence of the substring and returns a boolean, while `indexOf` returns the index of the substring or -1 if not found, which could lead to different logical flows in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.indexOf("(node.js:") === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because this change checks if the substring appears at the very start of the string, which is a more restrictive condition than the original check that looks for the substring anywhere in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.indexOf("(node.js:") > 5
```
This would result in different behavior because this condition requires the substring to appear after the 5th character of the string, which could cause valid stack lines that start with the substring to be ignored, leading to potential misbehavior in stack trace filtering.

DONE.
