  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last item in the array, not the item at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first item in the array, not the item at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons = []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the entire array, not just the item at the specified index.

DONE.
