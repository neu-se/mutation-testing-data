  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the word "person" to make it plural, but this new code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not recognize the word "people" as a plural form of "person".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would recognize "peoples" as a plural form of "person" and would not result in different behavior.

DONE.
