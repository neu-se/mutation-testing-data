  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are swapped, which would cause the resulting angle to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting angle would be offset by π radians, which would cause the complex number to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting angle would be offset by -π radians, which would cause the complex number to be incorrect.

DONE.
