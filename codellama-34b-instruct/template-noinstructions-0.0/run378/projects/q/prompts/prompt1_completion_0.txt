  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "function" if `bootstrap` is a function, and "object" if it is an object. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `typeof bootstrap !== "function"` would cause the code to enter the `if` block if `bootstrap` is an object, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "undefined" if `bootstrap` is not defined. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `typeof bootstrap === "undefined"` would cause the code to enter the `if` block if `bootstrap` is not defined, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "string" if
