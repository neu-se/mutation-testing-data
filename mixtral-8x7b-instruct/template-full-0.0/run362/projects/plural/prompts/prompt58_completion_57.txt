 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule will be added to the end of the `rules` array instead of the beginning, potentially changing the order in which rules are applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules = rules.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array and does not modify the original `rules` array, so the `addRule` function will not actually change the `rules` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules[0] =
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the first rule in the `rules` array with a new rule, potentially changing the behavior of the `plural` function.

DONE.
