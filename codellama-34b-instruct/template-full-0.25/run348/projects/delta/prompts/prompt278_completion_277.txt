  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `thisOp.retain` to be the same as `otherOp.retain`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = !otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `otherOp.retain` and assign it to `thisOp.retain`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = otherOp.retain + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `otherOp.retain` and assign it to `thisOp.retain`, which could cause
