  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra iteration, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not run at all, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only run once, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
