  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match the same strings as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.match
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not return the same groups as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not return a match object with groups as the original code fragment.

DONE.
