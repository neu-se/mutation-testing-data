  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c == 'i' || c == 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison uses type-coercion, so if `c` is not a string, the expression would evaluate to `NaN`, which is not equivalent to the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'i' || c === 'I' || c === '+' || c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the same type-coercion issue as above, but also including additional operators.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'i' || c === 'I' || c === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `0` to the comparison, which would make the expression always evaluate to `NaN` if `c` is not a string.

DONE.
