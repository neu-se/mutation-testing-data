  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a point with more than two coordinates as invalid, while the original code would consider it valid if it had exactly two coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(point.coordinates) || point.coordinates.length !== 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a point with three coordinates as invalid, while the original code would consider it valid if it had exactly two coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a point with less than two coordinates as invalid, while the original code would consider it valid if it had exactly two coordinates.

DONE.
