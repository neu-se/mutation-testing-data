  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` and `Math.atan2` have different return values. While `Math.atan` returns the arctangent of a single number, `Math.atan2` returns the arctangent of two numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` and `Math.atan2` have different return values. While `Math.acos` returns the arccosine of a single number, `Math.atan2` returns the arctangent of two numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` and `Math.atan2` have different return values. While `Math.asin` returns the arcsine of a single number, `Math.atan2` returns the arctangent of
