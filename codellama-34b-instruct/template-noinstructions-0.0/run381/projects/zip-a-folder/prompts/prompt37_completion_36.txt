  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, so if the `src` parameter is a glob, the `!isGlob(src)` expression would evaluate to `false`, and the `directory` method would be called instead of the `glob` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the expression, so if the `src` parameter is a glob, the `isGlob(src) && false` expression would evaluate to `false`, and the `directory` method would be called instead of the `glob` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the expression, so if the `src`
