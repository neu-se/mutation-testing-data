  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol, baseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to compare the protocols of the two URLs, rather than the URLs themselves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host, baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to compare the hosts of the two URLs, rather than the URLs themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.path, baseUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to compare the paths of the two URLs, rather than the URLs themselves.

DONE.
