 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` value will always be falsy, which might not be the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 + op
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of `op` to a number, which might not be expected in the original code. This could lead to unexpected results if the rest of the code assumes `op` is a boolean or another type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes `op` is a string and tries to convert it to uppercase. This would cause a TypeError if `op` is not a string, which would expose a potential issue in the code's type handling.

DONE.
