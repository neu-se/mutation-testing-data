  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the `cbs` array, which would cause the callbacks to be called in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.filter(cb => cb !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method would remove any `undefined` elements from the `cbs` array, which would cause the callbacks to be called fewer times than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.map(cb => cb + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map()` method would add 1 to each element in the `cbs` array, which would cause the callbacks to be called with different arguments than expected.

DONE.
