  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'error'` is not emitted in the original code, and it would cause the `Dirty` instance to emit an `'error'` event when the write stream is closed, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'end'` is not emitted in the original code, and it would cause the `Dirty` instance to emit an `'end'` event when the write stream is closed, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'close'` is not emitted in the original code, and it would cause the `Dirty` instance to emit a `'close'` event when the write stream is closed, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
