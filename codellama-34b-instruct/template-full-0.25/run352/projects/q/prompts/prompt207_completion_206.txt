  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `console.warn` property is not a function, which would always be false since `console.warn` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `console` object is not an object, which would always be false since `console` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console.warn !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `console.warn` property is not a function, which would always be false since `console.warn` is a function.

DONE.
