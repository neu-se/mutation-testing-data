  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `end.tail` to `end`, creating a circular reference. Replacing it with `null` would break the circular reference and cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = end.head;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `end.tail` to `end`, creating a circular reference. Replacing it with `end.head` would create a different circular reference and cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = Q.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `end.tail` to `end`, creating a circular reference. Replacing it with a rejected promise would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
