  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `a`, which could change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the values of `a` and `b`, which could change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the values of `a` and `b`, which could change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
