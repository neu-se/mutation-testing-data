  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason, whereas `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a function that sends a progress notification to the promise's listeners, whereas `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, whereas `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value.

DONE.
