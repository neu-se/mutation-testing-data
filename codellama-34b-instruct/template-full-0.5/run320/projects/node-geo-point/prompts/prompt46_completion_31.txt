  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random bearing between 0 and 360 degrees, rather than using the actual bearing between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(φ2 - φ1) * 100
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing as the difference between the two latitudes, rather than the actual bearing between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(λ2 - λ1, φ2 - φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing using the latitude and longitude differences, rather than the actual bearing between the two points.

DONE.
