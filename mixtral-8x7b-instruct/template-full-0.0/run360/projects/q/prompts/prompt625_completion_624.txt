 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `object` to the current promise context, instead of using the provided `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `object` to `null`, which might cause issues when trying to access properties or invoke methods on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `object` in a new promise, which might cause unexpected behavior when trying to access properties or invoke methods on the original `object`.

DONE.
