  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the embed type to be incremented, which could result in a different embed type being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the embed type to be decremented, which could result in a different embed type being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the embed type to be doubled, which could result in a different embed type being used.

DONE.
