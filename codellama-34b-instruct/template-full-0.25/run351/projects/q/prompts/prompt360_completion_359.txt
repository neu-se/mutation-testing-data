  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `done` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `done` is initially `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so even if `done` is initially `true`, the `if` statement would still evaluate to `false` if `done` is reassigned to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so even if `done` is initially `false`, the `if` statement would still evaluate to `true` if `done` is reassigned to a different value.

DONE.
