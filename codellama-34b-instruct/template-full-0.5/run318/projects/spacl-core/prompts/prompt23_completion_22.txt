  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.substring(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match the first character of the path, whereas the original code matches the entire path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.split('/').reverse()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match the last segment of the path, whereas the original code matches the entire path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all forward slashes from the path, whereas the original code matches the path with forward slashes.

DONE.
