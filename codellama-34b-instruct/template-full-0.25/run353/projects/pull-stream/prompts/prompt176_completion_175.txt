  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `array` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `array.length` property, which would return a different value if the `array` is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `array` variable directly, while this replacement uses the first element of the `array`, which would return a different value if the `array` is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `array` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `pop()` method to remove the last element of the `array`, which would return a different value if the `array` is not empty.

DONE.
