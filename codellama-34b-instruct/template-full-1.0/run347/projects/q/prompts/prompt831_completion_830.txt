  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is resolved, the reject function will be called instead of the fulfill function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<undefined>
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is resolved, undefined will be passed to the fulfill function, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a rejection instead of a resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is resolved, an error will be thrown instead of the promise being resolved or rejected, which would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

DONE.
