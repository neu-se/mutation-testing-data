  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `options.deprecated`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of the value of `options.deprecated`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated ? options.deprecated : true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `options.deprecated`.

DONE.
