  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `void 0`, and it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [undefined, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `void 0`, and it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
