  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending" ||
                inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `valueOf` method to return the promise itself instead of the inspected value, which would break the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending" ||
                inspected.state === "rejected" ||
                inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `valueOf` method to return the fulfilled value instead of the inspected value, which would break the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending" ||
                inspected.state === "rejected" ||
                inspected.state === "fulfilled" ||
                inspected.state === "settled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the
