  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called even if the promise is not in the `unhandledRejections` array. This could lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called only if the promise is not in the `unhandledRejections` array. This could lead to unexpected behavior and errors if the promise is not in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called only if the promise is in the `unhandledRejections`
