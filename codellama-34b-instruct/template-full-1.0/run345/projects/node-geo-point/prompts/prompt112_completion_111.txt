  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` is the inverse of `Math.sin`, whereas `Math.tan` is the inverse of `Math.cos`, which is not relevant to the calculation of the bearing in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` is the inverse of `Math.cos`, whereas `Math.tan` is the inverse of `Math.sin`. This change would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` is the inverse of `Math.sin` and `Math.cos`, which are used in the calculation of the bearing, whereas `Math.tan` is the inverse of `Math.cos`. This change would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.
