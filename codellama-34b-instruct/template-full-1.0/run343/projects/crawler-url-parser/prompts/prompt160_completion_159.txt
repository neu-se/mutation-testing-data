  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/$*\/$)/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would match zero or more slashes after the last non-slash character, whereas the original code fragment would match exactly one slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/.\/\/([^/]*)[\/]?$/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would match any character after the last non-slash character, whereas the original code fragment would match any non-slash character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]*$/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would match any character except for a slash, whereas the original code fragment would match any non-slash character.

DONE.
