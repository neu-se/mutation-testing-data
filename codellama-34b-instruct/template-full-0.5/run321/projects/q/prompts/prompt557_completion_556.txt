  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `verb` method on the `generator` object, which may not exist or may have a different implementation than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array as an argument to the `verb` method, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `arg` variable as an argument to the `verb` method, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
