  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called instead of `resolve`, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method would be called instead of `resolve`, causing the promise to be notified instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.when
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` method would be called instead of `resolve`, causing the promise to be resolved when the specified condition is met, instead of being resolved immediately.

DONE.
