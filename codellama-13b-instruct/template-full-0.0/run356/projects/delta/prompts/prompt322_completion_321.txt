  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called with a different range of indices.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called with a different range of indices.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(2, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called with a different range of indices.

DONE.
