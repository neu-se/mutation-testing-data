  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 ** zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the tile size, while this replacement uses the `**` operator to calculate the tile size. The `**` operator has a higher precedence than the `Math.pow()` function, which means it will be evaluated first. This can lead to different results in some cases, especially when the `zoom` value is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the tile size, while this replacement uses the `*` operator to calculate the tile size. The `*` operator has a lower precedence than the `Math.pow()` function, which means it will be evaluated after the `Math.pow()` function. This can lead to different results in some cases, especially when the `zoom` value is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
