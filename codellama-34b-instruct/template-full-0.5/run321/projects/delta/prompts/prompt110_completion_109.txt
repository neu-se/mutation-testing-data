  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not defined in the `Op` interface, and the code would throw a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is not defined in the `Op` interface, and the code would throw a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property is not defined in the `Op` interface, and the code would throw a runtime error.

DONE.
