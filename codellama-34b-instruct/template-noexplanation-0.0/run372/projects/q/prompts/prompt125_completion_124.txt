  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key)
```
This change will cause the `object_hasOwnProperty` function to be called with the `key` argument, which will return a boolean value indicating whether the object has the specified property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key) && this[key] !== undefined
```
This change will cause the `object_hasOwnProperty` function to be called with the `key` argument, and the result will be checked against `undefined`. If the result is not `undefined`, the `key` property will be checked against `undefined`. If the `key` property is not `undefined`, the `object_hasOwnProperty` function will be called again with the `key` argument, and the result will be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key) && this[key] !== undefined
