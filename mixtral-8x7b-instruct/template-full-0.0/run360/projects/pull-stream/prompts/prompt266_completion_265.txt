 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would receive `false` instead of `null` as the first argument, indicating an error. The original code fragment uses `null` to signal that there is no error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the callback is reversed. The original code fragment passes `null` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_read` variable is used instead of `null`. This could cause issues if `_read` is not `null` or `undefined`, as it would change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
