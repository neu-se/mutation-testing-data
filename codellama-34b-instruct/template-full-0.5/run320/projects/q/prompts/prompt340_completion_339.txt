  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is not returning a promise, so the `inspected.state` will never be "pending" or "rejected".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is not returning a promise, so the `inspected.state` will never be "pending" or "rejected".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is not returning a promise, so the `inspected.state` will never be "pending" or "rejected".

DONE.
