  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter would cause the `parse` method to not parse the query string, which could lead to incorrect parsing of URLs with query parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter would cause the `parse` method to not parse the fragment, which could lead to incorrect parsing of URLs with fragments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` parameter would cause the `parse` method to parse the query string and fragment, which could lead to incorrect parsing of URLs with query parameters or fragments.

DONE.
