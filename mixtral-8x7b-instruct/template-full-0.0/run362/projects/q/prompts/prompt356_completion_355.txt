 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error instead of returning a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new error object, but doesn't reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new rejected promise, but doesn't pass the exception to the rejected callback.

DONE.
