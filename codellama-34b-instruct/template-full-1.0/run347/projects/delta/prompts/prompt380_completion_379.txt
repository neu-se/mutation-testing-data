  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.previous()` would iterate the other delta in the opposite direction, potentially causing the transform function to miss or duplicate some operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` would iterate the current delta instead of the other delta, potentially causing the transform function to miss or duplicate some operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the next element in the other delta instead of the current element, potentially causing the transform function to miss or duplicate some operations.

DONE.
