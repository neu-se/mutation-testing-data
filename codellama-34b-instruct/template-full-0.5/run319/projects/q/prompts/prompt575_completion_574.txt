  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `bind` have different behaviors when it comes to setting the `this` context. `call` will set the `this` context to the first argument passed to it, while `bind` will set the `this` context to the function it's called on.
