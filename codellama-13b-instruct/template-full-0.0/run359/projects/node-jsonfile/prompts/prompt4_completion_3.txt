  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is being accessed directly, rather than through the `options.encoding` property. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `options` object is not defined or if it does not have an `encoding` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding || 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.encoding` property is being used as a fallback value if it is not defined. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `options` object does not have an `encoding` property, as it would default to the `utf8` encoding instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding || 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.encoding` property is being used as a fallback value if it is not defined. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `options` object
