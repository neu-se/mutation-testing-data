  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g, '\\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the character class `[^.$]` matches any character except `.` and `$`, whereas the original character class `[.$]` matches either `.` or `$`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^.$][^$]/g, '\\$1$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches two characters instead of one, and the replacement string includes two capture groups instead of one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g, '\\\$1\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now includes a second capture group, which is not present in the original regular expression.

DONE.
