  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code fragment, the `array_slice` function is called with the `arguments` object as its first argument, which contains all arguments passed to the enclosing function. By calling `array_slice` with the `arguments` object as its first argument, the resulting array would be a copy of `arguments` with the first argument removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code fragment, the `array_slice` function is called with the `arguments` object as its first argument, and the `1` constant as its second argument, resulting in an array that contains all arguments passed to the enclosing function, except for the first argument. In this option, the `array_slice` function is called with the `arguments` object as its first argument, the `1` constant as its second argument, and the `2
