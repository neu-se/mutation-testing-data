  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, so it would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, so it would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning `true` or `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, so it would return `undefined` instead of `true` or `false`.

DONE.
