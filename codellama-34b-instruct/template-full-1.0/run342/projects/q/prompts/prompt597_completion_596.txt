  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is being called unnecessarily and may change the object's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[dispatch]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` property is being accessed using bracket notation, which may not be the same as calling the function directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` function is being called directly, which may change the object's behavior.

DONE.
