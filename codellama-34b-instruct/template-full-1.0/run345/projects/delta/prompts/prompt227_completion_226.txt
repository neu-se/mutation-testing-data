  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `component` array is accessed using the wrong index. The code expects the first element of the `component` array to be the type of the delta operation, but by using `component[1]` instead, the code will attempt to use the second element of the `component` array as the type, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof component[0] === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the type of the `component` array element would always return `false`, causing the code to never execute the `switch` statement and always return an empty delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[0] !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the type of the `component` array element would never be true, causing the code to always execute the `switch` statement and potentially return an incorrect delta.
