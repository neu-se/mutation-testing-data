  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume()`, which would consume the response data and free up memory, while `res.resume(null)` would not consume the response data and would not free up memory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume()`, which would consume the response data and free up memory, while `res.resume(undefined)` would not consume the response data and would not free up memory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `res.resume()`, which would consume the response data and free up memory, while `res.resume(true)` would not consume the response data and would not free up memory.

DONE.
