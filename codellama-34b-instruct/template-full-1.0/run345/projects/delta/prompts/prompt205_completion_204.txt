  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'string' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `otherOp.delete` as a string instead of a number, which would cause the code to not execute the insert operation when `otherOp.delete` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain === null))
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `thisOp.retain` as an object instead of a number, which would cause the code to not execute the insert operation when `thisOp.retain` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced
