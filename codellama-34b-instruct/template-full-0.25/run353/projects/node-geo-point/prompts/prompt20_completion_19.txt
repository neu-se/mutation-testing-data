  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has the specified property as its own property, rather than inheriting it. This change would cause the `fromObject` method to throw a `TypeError` if the object does not have the specified properties, even if they are inherited from a prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has the specified property as its own property, rather than inheriting it. This change would cause the `fromObject` method to throw a `TypeError` if the object does not have either of the specified properties, even if they are inherited from a prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
