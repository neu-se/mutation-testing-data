  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `Promise.resolve()` on a promise object will return a new promise that is resolved with the same value as the original promise, but the original promise object is not modified. In the original code, the `untrackRejection` function is called on the original promise object, which would remove it from the list of unhandled rejections, but if `Promise.resolve()` is used, a new promise object is returned, and the `untrackRejection` function would not be called on the original promise object.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(fulfill, reject));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to handle the resolution or rejection of the promise, which would create a new promise that is either fulfilled or rejected with the same value as the original promise. In the original code, the `untrackRejection` function is called on the original promise object, which would remove it from the list of unhandled
