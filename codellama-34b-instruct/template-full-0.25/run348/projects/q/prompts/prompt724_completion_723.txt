  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is `undefined` in this case. This means that the new promise will be fulfilled with the value `undefined`, even if the original promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is rejected with the error thrown by the callback function. This means that the new promise will be rejected with the error "error", even if the original promise is fulfilled.
