  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `i < array.length` to check if the end of the array has been reached, while the mutated code uses `i < array.length - 1`, which would cause the loop to exit one iteration earlier.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `i < array.length` to check if the end of the array has been reached, while the mutated code uses `i < array.length + 1`, which would cause the loop to continue one iteration longer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `i < array.length` to check if the end of the array has been reached, while the mutated code uses `i < array.length * 2`, which would cause the
