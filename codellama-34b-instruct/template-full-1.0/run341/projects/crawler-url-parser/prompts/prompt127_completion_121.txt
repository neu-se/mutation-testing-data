  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl_path` is a different property of the `linkurl` object, although it contains similar values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl_parts.length` is the number of parts in the `linkurl_path`, whereas `linkurl` is the URL itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.subdomain` is the subdomain of the `linkurl`, whereas `linkurl` is the URL itself.

DONE.
