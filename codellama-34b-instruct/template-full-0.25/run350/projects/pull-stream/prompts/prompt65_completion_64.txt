  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `done` callback if `end` is `true`, while the new code fragment would call it regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `done` callback with `null` if `end` is `true`, while the new code fragment would call it with `null` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `done` callback with `false` if `end` is `true`, while the new code fragment would call it with `false` regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
