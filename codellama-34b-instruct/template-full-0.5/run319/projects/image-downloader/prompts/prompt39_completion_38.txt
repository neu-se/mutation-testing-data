  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the Promise would be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the Promise would be resolved with a null value instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve({ filename: 'wrong_dest' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the Promise would be resolved with a different filename than the expected one.

DONE.
