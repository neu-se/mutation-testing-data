  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second element of the `args` array instead of the first element which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `args` array instead of the first element which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `args` array incremented by 1 instead of the first element which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
