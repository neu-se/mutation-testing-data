  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this code checks if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this code checks if it is not the string 'object'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null && typeof op.retain !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this code checks if it is not null and not an object.

DONE.
