  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key of object
```
This would result in different behavior because `of` is used to iterate over the values of an object, whereas `in` is used to check if a property exists in an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = object[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of the property to a variable, rather than checking if the property exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = Object.keys(object).indexOf(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the property exists in the object, but would also return the index of the property in the object.

DONE.
