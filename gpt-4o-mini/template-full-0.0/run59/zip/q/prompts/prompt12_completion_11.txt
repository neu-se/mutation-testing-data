Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `ses` is an object rather than checking if it is defined, which could lead to a situation where the code incorrectly assumes `ses` exists when it might not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `ses` is explicitly `null`, which would always return `false` if `ses` is defined, thus bypassing the intended check for its existence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses === "undefined" || ses === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for both `undefined` and `null`, which could lead to a false negative if `ses` is defined but not initialized properly, thus preventing the code from executing as intended.

DONE.
