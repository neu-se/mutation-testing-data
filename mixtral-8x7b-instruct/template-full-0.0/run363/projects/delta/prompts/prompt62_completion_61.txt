 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<any>[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty array, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of keys in the given object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'length'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string 'length', whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of keys in the given object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the maximum value of the given arguments, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of keys in the given object.

DONE.
