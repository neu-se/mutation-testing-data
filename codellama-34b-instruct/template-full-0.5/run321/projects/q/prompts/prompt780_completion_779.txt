  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the result of the `promise` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that is not a function, whereas `regardless` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("Error message")` would throw an error with the message "Error message", whereas `regardless` would return the result of the `promise` function.

DONE.
