  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the `object` argument in the `array_slice`, which is not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first argument, `object`, from the `array_slice`, which is also not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first argument, `object`, from the `array_slice`, while also using the `slice` method instead of `array_slice`, which could produce different results.

DONE.
