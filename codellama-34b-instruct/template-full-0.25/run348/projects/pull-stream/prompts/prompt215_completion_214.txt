  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` would have called the `map` function with the `data` argument, but this replacement code fragment would call the `cb` function with the `data` argument instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` would have called the `map` function with the `data` argument, but this replacement code fragment would call the `cb` function with the `err` and `null` arguments instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` would have called the `map` function with the `data` argument, but this replacement code fragment would call the `cb` function with the `null` and `null` arguments instead.

DONE.
