  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a local variable in the `defer` function, and it is not the same as `resolvedPromise`, which is a property of the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is a property of the `deferred` object, and it is not the same as `resolvedPromise`, which is a property of the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `resolvedPromise` is a property of the `promise` object that contains the resolved value.

DONE.
