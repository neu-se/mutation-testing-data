  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] of this._queue.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an iterator that includes both the keys and values of the queue, whereas the original code fragment only includes the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] of this._queue.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns an iterator that only includes the values of the queue, whereas the original code fragment includes both the keys and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] of this._queue.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an iterator that only includes the keys of the queue, whereas the original code fragment includes both the keys and values.

DONE.
