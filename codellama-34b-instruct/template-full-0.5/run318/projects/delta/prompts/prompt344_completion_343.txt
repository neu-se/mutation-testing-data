  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `embedType` string to lowercase, which could cause the `getHandler()` method to return a different handler object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string, which could cause the `getHandler()` method to return a different handler object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator concatenates the `embedType` string with the string `'1'`, which could cause the `getHandler()` method to return a different handler object.

DONE.
