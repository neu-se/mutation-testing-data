Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[a-z]/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code removed trailing zeros after decimal point, but this replacement would remove all lowercase letters, altering the output of the `parseValue` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\d+/g
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of removing trailing zeros after decimal point, this replacement would remove all digits, resulting in a completely different output for the `parseValue` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\./
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code removed trailing zeros after decimal point, but this replacement would remove the decimal point at the beginning of a string, if present, changing the output of the `parseValue` function.

DONE.
