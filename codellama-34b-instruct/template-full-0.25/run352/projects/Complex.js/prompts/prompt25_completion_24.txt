  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the absolute value of the input is less than 3000, while the new code fragment is checking if the square of the input is less than 3000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the absolute value of the input is less than 3000, while the new code fragment is checking if the square of the input is greater than 3000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the absolute value of the input is less than 3000, while the new code fragment is checking if the square of the input is less than 6000.

DONE.
