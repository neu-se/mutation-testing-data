  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the absolute value of `min`, which is not the same as the original code fragment `getNumStr(offset)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(offset % 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the remainder of `offset` divided by 60, which is not the same as the original code fragment `getNumStr(min)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of `offset` divided by 60, which is not the same as the original code fragment `getNumStr(min)`.

DONE.
