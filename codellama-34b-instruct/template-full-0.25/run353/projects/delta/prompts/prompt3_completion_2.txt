  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneDeep` is a function that creates a deep copy of an object, but `b` is already an object, so there is no need to clone it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is an object, but it does not have a `clone` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is an object, but `slice` is a method that is typically used on arrays, not objects.

DONE.
