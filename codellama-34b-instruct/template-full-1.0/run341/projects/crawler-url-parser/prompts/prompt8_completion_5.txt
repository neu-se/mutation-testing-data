  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test(str);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string contains illegal characters, while the new code fragment checks if it does not contain illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return _has_illegal_chars(str) || str.length < 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the string contains illegal characters, while the new code fragment also checks if the string is less than 2 characters long.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return /^[a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test(str);
```
This would result
