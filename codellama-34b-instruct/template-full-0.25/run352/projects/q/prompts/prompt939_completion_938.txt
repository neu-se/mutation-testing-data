  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array, while `push` modifies the existing array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` combines two arrays, while `slice` returns a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` combines two arrays, while `splice` modifies an array by removing or replacing existing elements.

DONE.
