  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is being called on the `uncurryThis` function, which would cause the function to be executed with the `this` binding set to the global object, rather than the `Function` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is being called on the `uncurryThis` function, which would cause the function to be executed with the `this` binding set to the global object, rather than the `Function` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `uncurryThis` function, which would cause the function to be executed with the `this` binding set to the global object, rather than the `Function` object.

DONE.
