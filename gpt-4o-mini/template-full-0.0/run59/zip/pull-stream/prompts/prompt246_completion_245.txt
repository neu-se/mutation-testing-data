Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the callback to be called with a `true` value, which may not represent the actual error or abort condition, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the stream's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument of the callback to a string 'error', which could mislead the consumer of the stream into thinking that valid data was returned, instead of an error condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `end` variable (which is intended to indicate the end of the stream) to the callback, potentially causing confusion or incorrect handling of the stream's termination instead of passing the original callback function.

DONE.
