  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `callback` variable, which is used to create a new promise in the `fin` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fin` method to return a promise that is already resolved with the value `null`, instead of a promise that is resolved with the value returned by the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fin` method to return a promise that is rejected with the error "something went wrong", instead of a promise that is resolved with the value returned by the `callback` function.

DONE.
