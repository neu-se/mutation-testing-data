  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf()` would return the index of the last occurrence of the specified value in the given string, whereas `indexOf()` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `charAt(0)` returns the first character of the specified string, whereas `indexOf()` returns the index of the specified value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].search("@" + lines[0].length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `search()` would return the index of the first match of the specified regular expression in the given string, whereas `indexOf()` returns the index of the specified value.

DONE.
