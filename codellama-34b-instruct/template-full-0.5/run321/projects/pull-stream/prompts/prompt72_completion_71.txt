  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a non-null value, and the new code fragment would cause the function to return early with a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a defined value, and the new code fragment would cause the function to return early with an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a numeric value, and the new code fragment would cause the function to return early with a NaN value.

DONE.
