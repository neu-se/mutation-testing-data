  Option 1:
```
const verb in verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the properties of the `verbs` object instead of the values.

Option 2:
```
for (let i = 0; i < verbs.length; i++) {
    this.verbs[verbs[i]] = false;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the indices of the `verbs` array instead of the values.

Option 3:
```
for (let x of verbs) {
    this.verbs[x] = false;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the `verbs` object instead of the keys.

DONE.
