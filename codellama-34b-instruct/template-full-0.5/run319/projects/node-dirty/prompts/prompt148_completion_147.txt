  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` array would be iterated in reverse order, potentially causing the callbacks to be called in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `cbs` array would be removed, potentially causing the callbacks to be called with a different set of arguments than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.map(cb => cb.bind(null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the callbacks would be bound to a different context than expected, potentially causing them to behave differently when called.

DONE.
