  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This could result in different behavior because Math.round() rounds a number to the nearest integer, whereas Math.ceil() rounds up to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This could result in different behavior because Math.round() rounds a number to the nearest integer, whereas Math.floor() rounds down to the nearest integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(this['im'] * places) + Math.round(this['re'] * places)
```
This could result in different behavior because it is a different way of rounding the sum of the real and imaginary parts to the specified number of decimal places.

DONE.
