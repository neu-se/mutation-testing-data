  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the sine of the angular distance δ between the two points, while the modified code calculates the sine of the distance between the equator and the point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the sine of the angular distance δ between the two points, while the modified code calculates the sine of the distance between the point and the equator.
