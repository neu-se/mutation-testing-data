  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the line ending from LF (Unix-style) to CRLF (Windows-style).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the line ending from LF (Unix-style) to CR (MacOS-style).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the line ending altogether, causing the data to be written on the same line.

DONE.
