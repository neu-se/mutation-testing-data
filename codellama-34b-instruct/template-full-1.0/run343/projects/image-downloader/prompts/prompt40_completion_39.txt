  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'wrong_file.txt' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the file to be saved with a different name, which may cause issues if the program relies on the file being saved with the expected name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the file to be saved without a name, which may cause issues if the program relies on the file being saved with a name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the file to be saved without a name, which may cause issues if the program relies on the file being saved with a name.

DONE.
