  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the `infinite` function, and the new code fragment `end === undefined` checks whether the `end` variable is undefined or not. If `end` is undefined, the function will return `cb(end)` immediately, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the `infinite` function, and the new code fragment `end !== null` checks whether the `end` variable is not null or not. If `end` is not null, the function will return `cb(null, generate())` immediately, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() <= 0.5
```
