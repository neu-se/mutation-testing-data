  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method is not defined for arrays in JavaScript.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of the array, whereas `length` returns the number of elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of the array, whereas `length` returns the number of elements in the array.

DONE.
