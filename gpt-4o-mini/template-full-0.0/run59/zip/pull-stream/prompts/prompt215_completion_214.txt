Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the callback's second argument to `null`, which may lead to incorrect handling of the data in the calling function, as it implies that no data was processed successfully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the positions of the error and data arguments in the callback, which could confuse the caller into thinking that the operation was successful when it actually failed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb('error', cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a string `'error'` as the first argument instead of the actual error object, which could lead to incorrect error handling and misinterpretation of the error context in the callback.

DONE.
