  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would always return 1, regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would always return -1, regardless of the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would return a random value between 0 and 1, regardless of the input value.

DONE.
