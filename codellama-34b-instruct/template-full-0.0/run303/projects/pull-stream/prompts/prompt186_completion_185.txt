  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with the value `true`, while the new code fragment `cb(false)` would call the callback function with the value `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with the value `array[i++]`, while the new code fragment `cb(array[i++])` would call the callback function with the value `array[i++]` and then increment `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with the value `array[i++]`, while the new code fragment `cb(array[i--])` would call the callback function with the value `array[i
