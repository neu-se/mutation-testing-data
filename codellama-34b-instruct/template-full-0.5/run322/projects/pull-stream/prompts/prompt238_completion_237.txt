  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` argument is being passed to the `cb` function instead of the `end` argument, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is being called with three arguments instead of two, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is being passed as the third argument to the `cb` function, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
