  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` would remove the last element of the `stacks` array, while `unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` would remove the first element of the `stacks` array, while `unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` would add an empty array to the end of the `stacks` array, while `unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
