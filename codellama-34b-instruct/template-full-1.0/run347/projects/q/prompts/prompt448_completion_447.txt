  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, `pop()` would remove the previously added rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array, which would mean that the rejection would no longer be tracked as unhandled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, `shift()` would remove the previously added rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array, which would mean that the rejection would no longer be tracked as unhandled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior
