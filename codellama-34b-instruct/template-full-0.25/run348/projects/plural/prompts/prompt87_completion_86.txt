  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal that represents a single person, while the new code fragment is a string literal that represents multiple people.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal that represents a single person, while the new code fragment is a string literal that represents multiple people with an extra "s" at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal that represents a single person, while the new code fragment is a concatenation of two string literals that represent a single person and multiple people, respectively.

DONE.
