  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square of 
the magnitude instead of the square of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the 
multiplication of the magnitude and the real part instead of the square of the 
real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (a - r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the 
difference of the magnitude and the real part instead of the square of the 
real part.

DONE.
