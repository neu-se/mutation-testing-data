  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the `opData` and `baseOpData` objects, which is not the intended behavior of the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(baseOpData, opData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the `baseOpData` and `opData` objects in the opposite order, which could produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert only the `opData` object, which could produce different results than inverting both `opData` and `baseOpData` objects.

DONE.
