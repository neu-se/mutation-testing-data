  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first element of the `baseOpData` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all elements of `baseOpData` except for the first one, rather than the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `baseOpData` array, rather than the array itself.

DONE.
