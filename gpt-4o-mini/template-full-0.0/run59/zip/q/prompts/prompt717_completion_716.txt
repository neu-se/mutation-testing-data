Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to dispatch a request for the "values" of the object's properties instead of the "keys", leading to incorrect results when trying to retrieve property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getOwnPropertyNames"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the dispatch to request the own property names of the object, which may not be the same as the keys returned by the original implementation, potentially including non-enumerable properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to dispatch a request for the "length" property of the object, which is not relevant to retrieving the keys of the object and would likely lead to an error or unexpected result.

DONE.
