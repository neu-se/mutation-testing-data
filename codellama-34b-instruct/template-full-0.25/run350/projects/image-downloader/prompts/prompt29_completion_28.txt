  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would use the `http` module instead of the `https` module, which could cause the request to be sent over an unencrypted connection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would use the `http` module and the `:` character would be treated as a separator between the protocol and the hostname, which could cause the request to be sent to the wrong host.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would use the `https` module and the `:` character would be treated as a separator between the protocol and the hostname, which could cause the request to be sent to the wrong host.

DONE.
