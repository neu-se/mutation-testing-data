  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to Δλ would cause the bearing calculation to be off by 1 degree.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 to Δλ would cause the bearing calculation to be off by twice the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 to Δλ would cause the bearing calculation to be off by 1 degree in the opposite direction.

DONE.
