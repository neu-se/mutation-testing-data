  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, and adding 1 to it would change its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, and multiplying it by 2 would change its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, and dividing it by 2 would change its value.

DONE.
