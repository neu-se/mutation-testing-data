  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to provide a default value for the `cb` parameter if it is not provided, while this replacement uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) which would result in the `cb` parameter being `undefined` if it is not provided, leading to different behavior in the `sink.abort` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done ? function () {} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to provide a default value for the `cb` parameter if it is not provided, while this replacement uses the ternary operator (`?:`) which would result in the `cb` parameter being `null` if it is not provided, leading to different behavior in the `sink.abort` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done ? function () {} : undefined
```
