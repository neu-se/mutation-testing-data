  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr(0, w.length - 2)` to remove the last two characters of the word, while the new code fragment uses `substr(0, w.length - 1)` to remove only the last character. This would cause the resulting plural form to be incorrect for words that end in "x" or "s".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr(0, w.length - 2)` to remove the last two characters of the word, while the new code fragment uses `substr(0, w.length - 2)` to remove the last two characters of
