  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of the array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of the array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
