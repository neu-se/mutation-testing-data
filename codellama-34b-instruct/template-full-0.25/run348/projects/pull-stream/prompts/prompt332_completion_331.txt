  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `null` is a null value. This change would cause the `else` block to be executed, which would call the `onEnd` function with a null value, rather than the expected `end` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `undefined` is a special value that indicates the absence of a value. This change would cause the `else` block to be executed, which would call the `onEnd` function with an undefined value, rather than the expected `end` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `true` is a boolean value that is always true. This change would cause the `else` block to be executed
