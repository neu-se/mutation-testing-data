  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the result of `this['im'] * places` would cause the final result to be different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `this['im'] * places` by 2 would cause the final result to be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the result of `this['im'] * places` would cause the final result to be different from the original code.

DONE.
