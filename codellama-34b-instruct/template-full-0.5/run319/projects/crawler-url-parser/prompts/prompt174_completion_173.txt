  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"for testing purpose"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comment and the replaced code fragment is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"for testing purpose" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comment and the replaced code fragment is a string with a number concatenated to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"for testing purpose".length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comment and the replaced code fragment is a string with a property accessed on it.

DONE.
