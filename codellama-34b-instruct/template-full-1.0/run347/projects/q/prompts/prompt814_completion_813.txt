  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` is a different method than `callback.fcall()`, and would not behave in the same way when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback()` is a different function than `callback.fcall()`, and would not be invoked with the same arguments as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a promise that is already resolved, whereas the original code fragment returned a promise that was resolved with the result of the `callback.fcall()` method.

DONE.
