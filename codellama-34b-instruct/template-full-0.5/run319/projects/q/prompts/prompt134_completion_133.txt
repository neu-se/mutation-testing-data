  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value by 2, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the value.

DONE.
