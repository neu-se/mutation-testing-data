  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` schedules a function to be called repeatedly, while `setTimeout` schedules a function to be called once after a delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` schedules a function to be called immediately, while `setTimeout` schedules a function to be called after a delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` schedules a function to be called when the screen is next refreshed, while `setTimeout` schedules a function to be called after a delay.

DONE.
