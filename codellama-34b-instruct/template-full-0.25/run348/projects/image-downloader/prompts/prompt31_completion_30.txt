  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(1).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method with an argument of `1` would remove the first character of the URL, which could cause the `startsWith` method to return `false` even if the URL starts with "https".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft().startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method without an argument would remove all whitespace characters from the beginning of the URL, which could cause the `startsWith` method to return `false` even if the URL starts with "http".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimRight` method would remove all whitespace characters from the end of the URL, which could cause the `startsWith` method to return `false` even if the URL starts with "https
