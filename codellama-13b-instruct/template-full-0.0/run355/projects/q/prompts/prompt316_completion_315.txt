  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` variable is now compared to `null` instead of `void 0`, which would cause the `inspect` function to be called even if it is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` variable is now compared to `undefined` instead of `void 0`, which would cause the `inspect` function to not be called if it is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` variable is now compared to `false` instead of `void 0`, which would cause the `inspect` function to not be called if it is not defined.

DONE.
