  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this code checks if `b` is null. If `b` is null, the original code would still consider it an object, while this code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this code checks if `b` is undefined. If `b` is undefined, the original code would still consider it an object, while this code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b && typeof b !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this code checks if `b` is truthy (i.e. not null or undefined) and not an object. If `b` is null or undefined, the original code would still
