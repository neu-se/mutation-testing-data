  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `θ + Math.PI` will result in an angle that is 180 degrees off from the original angle, which would lead to a flipped result in `sinθ` and `cosθ`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * θ
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 * θ` will result in an angle that is twice the original angle, which would lead to a different result in `sin2θ` and `cos2θ`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(θ)` will result in the absolute value of the angle, which means that the resulting angle would always be positive, even if the angle was negative.

DONE.
