  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^www/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a protocol-relative URL (starting with `//`), while the new code fragment uses a specific protocol (starting with `http://`). This could cause issues with URLs that do not specify a protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.*\\//, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a single `/`, while the new code fragment uses a double `/`. This could cause issues with URLs that contain a port number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a protocol-relative URL (starting with `//`), while the new code fragment uses a specific protocol (starting with `http://`). This could cause issues with URLs that do not specify a protocol.

DONE.
