Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] || options
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return the `options` object if the country is not found in the `countries` cache, instead of returning `null` or the country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] && options
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `options` only if the country is found in the `countries` cache, which could lead to returning `undefined` if the country does not exist, rather than returning the country object or `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id].name
```
This would result in different behavior because it will attempt to access the `name` property of the country object, which could lead to a runtime error if `countries[id]` is `undefined`, instead of returning the country object itself.

DONE.
