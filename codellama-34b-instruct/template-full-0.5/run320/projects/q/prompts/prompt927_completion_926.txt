  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.call(arguments, 1)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `arguments` except the first one, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `arguments` starting from the second one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `arguments` starting from the second one, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `arguments` starting from the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)` would return a
