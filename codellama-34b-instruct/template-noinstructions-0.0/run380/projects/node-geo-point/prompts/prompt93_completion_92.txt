  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method uses the `θ` value to calculate the destination point, and adding `Math.PI` to it would cause the method to return a point that is 180 degrees away from the original point, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method uses the `θ` value to calculate the destination point, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the method to return a point that is twice as far away from the original point as it should be, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method uses the `θ` value to calculate the destination point, and subtracting `Math.PI` from it would cause the
