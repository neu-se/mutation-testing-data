Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line = new Delta();
```
This would result in different behavior because it resets the `line` variable to a new `Delta` instance, potentially losing any accumulated operations that should have been processed by the predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the next operation into `line` instead of passing `line` to the predicate function, which means the predicate will not be called with the current line of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `line` to `null`, which would cause a runtime error when the code attempts to access properties or methods on `line` later in the function, disrupting the flow of execution.

DONE.
