  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of `err`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `err` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `err` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `err` is strictly not equal to `null`.

DONE.
