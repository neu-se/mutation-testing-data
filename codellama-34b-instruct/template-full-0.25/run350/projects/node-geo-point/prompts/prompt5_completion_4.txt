  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for the `type` property would cause the function to return `false` for any object that does not have a `type` property set to `'Point'`, even if it has the required `coordinates` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for the `coordinates` property would cause the function to return `false` for any object that does not have a `coordinates` property set to an array with two elements, even if it has the required `type` property set to `'Point'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for both the `type` and `coordinates` properties
