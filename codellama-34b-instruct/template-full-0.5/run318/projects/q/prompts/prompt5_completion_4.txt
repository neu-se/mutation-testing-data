  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is now a function that returns an empty object, rather than a function that returns a promise. This could cause errors in the code that relies on the promise being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", null
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is now null, rather than a function. This could cause errors in the code that relies on the function being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is now a number, rather than a function. This could cause errors in the code that relies on the function being called.

DONE.
