  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute if the length of the array is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute once if the length of the array is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute once if the length of the array is zero.

DONE.
