  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the argument to `nodeArgs.push()`, which would cause an error if `nodeArgs` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the argument to `nodeArgs.push()`, which would cause an error if `nodeArgs` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "hello" would be passed as the argument to `nodeArgs.push()`, which would cause an error if `nodeArgs` is not defined.

DONE.
