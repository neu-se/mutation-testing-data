  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[reportedUnhandledRejections][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the first element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array that includes all elements of `reportedUnhandledRejections` except the first one, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array minus one, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
