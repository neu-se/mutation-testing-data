  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` context would be changed to the global object instead of the context of the `array_map` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the `this` context to the `callback` function, which may cause issues if the function expects a specific object to be passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty object `{}` would be passed as the `this` context to the `callback` function, which may cause issues if the function expects a specific object to be passed.

DONE.
