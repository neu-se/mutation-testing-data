  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/g
```
This code fragment uses the `g` flag to perform a global search and replace, which may cause the regular expression to match more than once in the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/i
```
This code fragment uses the `i` flag to perform a case-insensitive search, which may cause the regular expression to match strings that contain uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/m
```
This code fragment uses the `m` flag to perform a multi-line search, which may cause the regular expression to match strings that contain newline characters.

DONE.
