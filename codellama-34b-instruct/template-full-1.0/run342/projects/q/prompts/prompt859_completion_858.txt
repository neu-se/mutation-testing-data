  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` throws an error, while `deferred.resolve` resolves the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` throws an error, while `deferred` is a promise that would wait for resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` throws an error, while `null` is a valid argument that would not cause any exceptions.

DONE.
