  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a different method from `allResolved`, and it returns a promise for an array of states (as returned by `inspect`) when all promises have settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"spread"
```
This would result in different behavior because `spread` is a method that returns a promise for an array of fulfillment values or rejection reason when all promises are resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a different method from `allResolved`, and it returns a promise for an array of states (as returned by `inspect`) when all promises have settled.

DONE.
