  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, whereas the `==` operator only checks for value equality. In this case, the `pageurl` variable is a string, but the `===` operator would return `false` because the type of `pageurl` is not the same as the type of the string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string, whereas the `length` property of an object returns the number of properties in the object. In this case, the `pageurl` variable is a string, so the `length` property would return the number of characters in the string, which would be different from the number of properties in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.includes("string")
```
