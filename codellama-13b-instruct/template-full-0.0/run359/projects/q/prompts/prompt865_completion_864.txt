  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method would return a promise that resolves to `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method would return a promise that resolves to `null` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method would return a promise that resolves to the string `"hello"` instead of the original value.

DONE.
