  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the values of `a` and `b` in the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the expression to a sum instead of a product.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the expression to a product of `a` and `b` instead of a sum.

DONE.
