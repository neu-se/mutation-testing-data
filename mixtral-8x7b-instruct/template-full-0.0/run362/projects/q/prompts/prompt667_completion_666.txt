 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice()` function would receive an empty array as an argument, instead of the expected array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice()` function would receive the `this` value as an argument, instead of the expected array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice()` function would receive `null` as an argument, which would cause an error since `array_slice()` expects an array-like object as its first argument.

DONE.
