  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be concatenated with the number `1`, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be sliced to remove the first element, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.concat([1])]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be concatenated with the number `1`, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
