Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the current operation from `thisIter` instead of the operation from `otherIter`, potentially altering the composition of the delta and leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve one more operation than available from `otherIter`, which could lead to an error or unexpected behavior if `otherIter` does not have enough operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `retain` property of `otherOp` instead of the entire operation, which could lead to loss of information about the operation type and its associated attributes.

DONE.
