  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the remainder of `offset` divided by 60, rather than the result of dividing `offset` by 60.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 60.0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of dividing `offset` by 60.0, which is a floating-point number, rather than an integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 60 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of dividing `offset` by 60, plus 1, rather than just the result of dividing `offset` by 60.

DONE.
