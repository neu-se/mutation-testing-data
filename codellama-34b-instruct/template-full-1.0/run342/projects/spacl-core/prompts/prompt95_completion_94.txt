  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string "foo" to the policy name, potentially changing the search algorithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the policy to itself, instead of the value of `policy`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5 + policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the value of `policy.name` to 5, potentially changing the returned value.

DONE.
