  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['im']` would be set to `NaN`, which would cause the function to return a complex number with an imaginary part of `NaN`.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['im']` would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the function to return a complex number with an imaginary part of `undefined`.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = -z['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['im']` would be set to its negative value, which would cause the function to return a complex number with an imaginary part that is opposite to the original value.

DONE.
