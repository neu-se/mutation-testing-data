  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice()
```
This code fragment creates a shallow copy of the `verbs` array, which can be used to iterate over the array without modifying the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.concat()
```
This code fragment creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `verbs` array and the `verbs` array with the `deny` method applied to it. This can be used to create a new array that contains both the allowed and denied verbs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.filter(verb => !this.verbs[verb])
```
This code fragment creates a new array that contains only the verbs that are not allowed. This can be used to create a new array that contains only the denied verbs.

DONE.
