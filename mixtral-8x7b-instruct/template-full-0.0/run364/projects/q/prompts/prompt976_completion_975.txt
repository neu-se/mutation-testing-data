 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `args` if it is not falsy, while this change always passes an empty array. This could cause issues if the `nodeArgs` array relies on the values within `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `args` if it is not falsy, while this change passes `null` instead. This could cause issues if the `nodeArgs` array relies on the values within `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
globalArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `args` if it is not falsy, while this change passes a potentially undefined variable `globalArgs`. This could cause issues if the `nodeArgs` array relies on the values within `args` and the `globalArgs` variable is not defined or has different values.
