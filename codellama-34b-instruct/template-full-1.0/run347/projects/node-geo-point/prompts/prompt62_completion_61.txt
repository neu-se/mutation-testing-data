  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
Math.rcos instead of cos.
This would result in different behavior because Math.rcos uses the reciprocal function, which is the inverse of Math.cos. Using Math.rcos will produce a different output and could break the code if it's not properly referenced.
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
Math.sin(a) instead of cos(a).
This would result in different behavior because Math.sin and Math.cos are two different trigonometric functions. Replacing cos(a) with Math.sin(a) would produce a different output, which could break the code if it's not properly referenced.
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
Math.tan(a) instead of cos(a).
This would result in different behavior because Math.tan and Math.cos are two different trigonometric functions. Replacing cos(a) with Math.tan(a) would produce a different output, which could break the code if it's not properly referenced.
DONE
