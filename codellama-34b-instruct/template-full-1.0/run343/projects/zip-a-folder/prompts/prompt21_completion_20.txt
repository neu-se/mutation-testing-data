  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the `path` argument to `createWriteStream()`, leading to an error instead of creating a file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the `path` argument to `createWriteStream()`, leading to an error instead of creating a file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/path/to/file'
```
This would result in different behavior because a different file path would be passed as the `path` argument to `createWriteStream()`, leading to a different file being created instead of the intended one.

DONE.
