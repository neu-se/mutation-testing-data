  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.shift` returns the first element of the array, whereas `arr.pop` returns the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements except the first, whereas `arr.pop` returns the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.splice(0, 1)` removes the first element of the array and returns it, whereas `arr.pop` returns the last element.

DONE.
