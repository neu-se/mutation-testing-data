  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `matches()` method to check the rules in the opposite order than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the elements from the specified start index to the end of the array, which would cause the `matches()` method to skip the first rule in the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter((rule) => rule.matches(path, ctx))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, which would cause the `matches()` method to only check the rules that match the path and context.

DONE.
