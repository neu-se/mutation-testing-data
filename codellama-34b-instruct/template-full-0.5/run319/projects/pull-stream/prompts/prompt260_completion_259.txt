  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not being called with the correct arguments. The original code fragment calls the callback function with the correct arguments, but this new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not being called with the correct arguments. The original code fragment calls the callback function with the correct arguments, but this new code fragment does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not being called with the correct arguments. The original code fragment calls the callback function with the correct arguments, but this new code fragment does not.

DONE.
