  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `attempt1[3]`. This would result in different behavior because `attempt1[3]` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `attempt1[2] + 1`. This would result in different behavior because `attempt1[2] + 1` is a number, whereas `attempt1[1]` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `attempt2[2] + 100`. This would result in different behavior because `attempt2[2] + 100` is a number, whereas `attempt1[1]` is a string.

DONE.
