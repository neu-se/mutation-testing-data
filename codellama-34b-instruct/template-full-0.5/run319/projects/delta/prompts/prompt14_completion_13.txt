  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of attributes in the `AttributeMap`, rather than the attributes themselves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of the keys in the `AttributeMap`, rather than the attributes themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of the values in the `AttributeMap`, rather than the attributes themselves.

DONE.
