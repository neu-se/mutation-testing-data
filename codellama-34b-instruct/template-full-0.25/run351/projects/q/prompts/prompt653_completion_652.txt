  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at index 1 instead of index 2, which would cause the first argument to be included in the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at index 2 and end at index 1, which would cause the second argument to be included in the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at index 3, which would cause the third argument to be included in the `args` array.

DONE.
