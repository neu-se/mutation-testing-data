  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, starting from the last rule instead of the first. This could potentially cause the plural function to return incorrect results for certain words.

DONE.
