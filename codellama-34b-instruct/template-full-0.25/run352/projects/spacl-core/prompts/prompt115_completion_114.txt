  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.length` would return the number of verbs in the `verbs` object, while `verbs` would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `verbs` except the first one, while `verbs` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.filter(verb => verb !== 'GET')
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.filter(verb => verb !== 'GET')` would return a new array containing all the elements of `verbs` that are not equal to `'GET'`, while `verbs` would return the original array.

DONE.
