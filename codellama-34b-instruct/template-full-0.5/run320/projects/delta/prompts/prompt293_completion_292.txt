  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the line instead of pushing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the line instead of pushing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a new line instead of pushing the existing one.

DONE.
