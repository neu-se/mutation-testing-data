  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object now includes the `name` parameter, which was previously excluded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, [].slice.call(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is now converted to an array and sliced starting from the third element, which was previously the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, arguments.slice(2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is now sliced starting from the third element, which was previously the second element.

DONE.
