  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be sliced starting from the second element, instead of starting from the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(["extra"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra element would be added to the `args` array, which would affect the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be reversed, which would affect the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
