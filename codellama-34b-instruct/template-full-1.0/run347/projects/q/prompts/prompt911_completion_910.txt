  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extraneous Node.js-style callback to the argument list, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the Node.js-style callback onto the end of the argument list, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.assign(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the Node.js-style callback to the argument list, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
