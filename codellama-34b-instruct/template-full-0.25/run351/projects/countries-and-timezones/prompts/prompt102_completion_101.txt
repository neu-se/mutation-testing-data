  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of keys in the object, whereas `Object.assign` returns a new object with the properties of the original object and the new object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of values in the object, whereas `Object.assign` returns a new object with the properties of the original object and the new object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs in the object, whereas `Object.assign` returns a new object with the properties of the original object and the new object.

DONE.
