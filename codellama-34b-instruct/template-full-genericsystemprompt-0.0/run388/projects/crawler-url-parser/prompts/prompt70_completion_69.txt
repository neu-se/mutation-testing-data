  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { decodeEntities: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `decodeEntities` option is set to `false`, which means that HTML entities in the input data will not be decoded. This could cause issues if the input data contains HTML entities that are not properly encoded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { normalizeWhitespace: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `normalizeWhitespace` option is set to `true`, which means that whitespace characters in the input data will be normalized. This could cause issues if the input data contains whitespace characters that are important for the intended use case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { xmlMode: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `xmlMode` option is set to `true`, which means that the input data will be parsed
