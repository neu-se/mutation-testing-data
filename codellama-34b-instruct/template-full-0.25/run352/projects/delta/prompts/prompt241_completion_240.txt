  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length, otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the current iterator, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length, thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length of the current iterator by 1, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length, thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the length of the current iterator by 1, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff function.

DONE.
