  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.get(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `request.get()` is a different function than `request`, and it may not handle the request in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.post(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `request.post()` is a different function than `request.get()`, and it may not handle the request in the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.put(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `request.put()` is a different function than `request.get()` and `request.post()`, and it may not handle the request in the same way.

DONE.
