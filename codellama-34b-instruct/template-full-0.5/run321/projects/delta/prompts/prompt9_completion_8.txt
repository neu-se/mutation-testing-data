  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `a` object instead of the `b` object, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `b` object instead of the `a` object, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a || b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `a` object or the `b` object, whichever is not null or undefined, instead of just the keys of the `b` object as intended.

DONE.
