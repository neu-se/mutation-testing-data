  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would return `undefined` instead of an object with the composed attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would return an object with the composed attributes, but the `keepNull` parameter would be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would return an object with the composed attributes, but the `keepNull` parameter would be ignored, and the `transform` function would not be called.

DONE.
