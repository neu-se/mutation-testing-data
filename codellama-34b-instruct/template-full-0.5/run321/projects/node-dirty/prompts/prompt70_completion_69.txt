  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted as an `error` event, which would cause the `emit` method to be called with the wrong event name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted as a `close` event, which would cause the `emit` method to be called with the wrong event name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted as a `drain` event, which would cause the `emit` method to be called with the wrong event name.

DONE.
