Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `next` method to proceed when the length is strictly greater than the remaining length of the operation, potentially skipping operations that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` method to only proceed if the length is less than or equal to the remaining length of the operation, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations that should be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === opLength - offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the `next` method to proceed if the length is exactly one more than the remaining length of the operation, which is a very specific condition that is unlikely to be met in most cases, potentially causing operations to be skipped.

DONE.
