  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `aborted`, so the code would execute the `cb(aborted)` line even if `aborted` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `aborted` and `err` are true, so the code would execute the `cb(aborted)` line only if both conditions are true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `aborted` or `err` is true, so the code would execute the `cb(aborted)` line if either condition is true.

DONE.
