  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol if it is not already present, while the new code fragment always adds the protocol, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.
