  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset % 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the offset down to the nearest minute, rather than rounding it up to the nearest minute as the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(offset % 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the offset up to the nearest minute, rather than rounding it down to the nearest minute as the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(offset % 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the offset to the nearest minute, rather than rounding it up to the nearest minute as the original code fragment does.

DONE.
