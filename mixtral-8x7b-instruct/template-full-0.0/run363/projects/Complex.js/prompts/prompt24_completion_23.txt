 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1.41421356
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `Math.sqrt` function with the fixed value of the square root of 2, which would cause incorrect results when calculating the hypotenuse for non-trivial inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the square root calculation with a power operation, which would lead to incorrect results in the `hypot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * a + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the square root calculation entirely, which would lead to incorrect results in the `hypot` function.

DONE.
