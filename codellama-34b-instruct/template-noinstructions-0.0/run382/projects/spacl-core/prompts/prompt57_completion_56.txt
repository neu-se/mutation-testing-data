  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character that is not a dot or a dollar sign, instead of matching any character that is not a dot.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character that is not a dot or a dollar sign, but only once, instead of matching any character that is not a dot multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])*/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character that is not a dot or a dollar sign, multiple times, but only if it is followed by a dot or a dollar sign.

DONE.
