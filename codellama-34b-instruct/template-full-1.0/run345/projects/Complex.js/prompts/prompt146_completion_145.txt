  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['re'] * z['re'], this['im'] * z['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is different from the original code, which used addition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['re'] + z['im'], this['im'] + z['re']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator is different from the original code, which used multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(Math.log(this['re'] * z['re']) + Math.log(this['im'] * z['im']), 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator is different from the original code, which used multiplication, and the function Math.log is different from the original function used, which was multiplication.

DONE.
