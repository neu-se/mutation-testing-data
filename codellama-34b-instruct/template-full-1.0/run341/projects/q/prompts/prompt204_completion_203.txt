  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first element of the array returned by `getFileNameAndLineNumber()`, instead of the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber().length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the array returned by `getFileNameAndLineNumber()`, instead of the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber()[1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the second element of the array returned by `getFileNameAndLineNumber()`, instead of the entire array.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
