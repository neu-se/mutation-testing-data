 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.filter(predicate as any)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns an array of elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` transforms each element and returns a new array with the same length. By replacing `map` with `filter`, the returned array will have a different length and potentially different content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.reduce((acc, curr) => [...acc, curr], [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` is used to reduce an array to a single value by repeatedly applying a function to each element and accumulating the result. By replacing `map` with this `reduce` implementation, the returned array will have a different structure and content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.slice().map(predicate)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice
