  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve` is used to resolve the promise, but `ends.reject` would reject the promise instead. This could cause the program to behave differently when the promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `ended` is not a defined variable in the code. Using `ended` instead of `ends` would cause a reference error, which could change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `error` is not defined in the code. Using `error` as a parameter for `ends.resolve` would cause a reference error, which could change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
