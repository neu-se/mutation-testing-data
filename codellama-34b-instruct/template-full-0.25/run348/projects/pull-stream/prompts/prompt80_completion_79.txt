  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbed` is always truthy, whereas `!cbed` is only truthy when `cbed` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbed && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `!cbed && false` is always falsy, whereas `!cbed` is only falsy when `cbed` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed || false
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbed || false` is always truthy, whereas `!cbed` is only truthy when `cbed` is falsy.

DONE.
