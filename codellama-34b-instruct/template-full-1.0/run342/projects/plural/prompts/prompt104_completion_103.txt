  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function returns the word "s" for words ending in "man", while this new function would return "mes".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function returns the word "s" for words ending in "man", while this new function would return "es" for words ending in "mans".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ses' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function returns the word "s" for words ending in "man", while this new function would return "ses" for words ending in "man".

DONE.
