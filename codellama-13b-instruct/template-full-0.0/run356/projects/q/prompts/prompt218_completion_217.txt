  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would throw an error instead of returning a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

DONE.
