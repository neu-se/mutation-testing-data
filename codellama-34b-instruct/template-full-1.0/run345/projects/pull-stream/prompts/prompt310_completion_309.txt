  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the test function to evaluate the data, but this new code fragment would always return the opposite result as the test function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.bind(this, data)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not use the bind method to create a new function, but this new code fragment would create a new function that is bound to the current context and immediately called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes one argument to the test function, but this new code fragment would pass two arguments, which could potentially cause the test function to behave differently.

DONE.
