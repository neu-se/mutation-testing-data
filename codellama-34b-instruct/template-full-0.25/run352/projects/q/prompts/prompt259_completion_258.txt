  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.notify` is a function that notifies the progress of a promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

DONE.
