  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bison` word is missing the `\b` word boundary at the beginning, which would cause the regex to match words that contain `bison` as a substring, such as `bisonic`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is missing at the end of the regex, which would cause the regex to match words regardless of their case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is present at the end
