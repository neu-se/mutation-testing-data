  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is being called on a different object, which could potentially have a different `type` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is being called on a different object, which could potentially have a different `coordinates` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is being called on a different object, which could potentially have a different `longitude` property.

DONE.
