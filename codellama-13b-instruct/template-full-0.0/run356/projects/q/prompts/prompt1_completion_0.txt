  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not attempt to call the `bootstrap` function, which is a function that is only available in certain environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not attempt to call the `bootstrap` function, which is a function that is only available in certain environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to call the `bootstrap` function, which is a function that is only available in certain environments.

DONE.
