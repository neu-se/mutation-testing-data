  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, so it would not be considered a promise and the `untrackRejection` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, so it would not be considered a promise and the `untrackRejection` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object and does not have a `then` method, so it would not be considered a promise and the `untrackRejection` function would not be called.

DONE.
