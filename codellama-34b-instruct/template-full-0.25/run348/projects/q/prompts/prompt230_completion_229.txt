  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operands` array is accessed at a different index, which could lead to a different value being passed to the `progressListener` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && !operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would cause the `progressListener` function to be called with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the `progressListener` function to be called with a different value.

DONE.
