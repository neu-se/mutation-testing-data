  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This change will cause the `substr` method to return one more character than the original code, which may cause the `next` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This change will cause the `substr` method to return one less character than the original code, which may cause the `next` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This change will cause the `substr` method to return an empty string, which may cause the `next` method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
