  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(<PLACEHOLDER>).startsWith('https') ? https : http;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft()` method would remove any whitespace characters from the beginning of the `url` string, which could potentially cause the `startsWith()` method to return `false` even if the `url` string starts with "https".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight(<PLACEHOLDER>).startsWith('https') ? https : http;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimRight()` method would remove any whitespace characters from the end of the `url` string, which could potentially cause the `startsWith()` method to return `false` even if the `url` string starts with "https".
