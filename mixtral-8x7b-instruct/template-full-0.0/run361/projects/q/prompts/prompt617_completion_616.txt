 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"GET"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison in the `dispatch` method would fail, causing the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Symbol("get")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Symbol` type is not strictly equal to a string, causing the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => "get"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the `get` method from a property accessor to a function call, causing the code to behave differently.

DONE.
