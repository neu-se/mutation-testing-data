  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is set to an error object when the stream is aborted, while `null` is a null value that does not represent an error. If the code is replaced with `null`, the `abortCb` function will not be called with the `aborted` error, which may cause the stream to not be properly aborted.
