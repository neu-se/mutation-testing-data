  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `onAbort`, which is a callback function that is called when the `abort` event is triggered. By replacing it with `null`, we would no longer be calling the callback function, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the `abort` event is triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `onAbort`, which is a callback function that is called when the `abort` event is triggered. By replacing it with `undefined`, we would be calling the callback function with an undefined value, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the `abort` event is triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `onAbort`, which is a callback function that is called when the `abort` event is triggered. By replacing it with
