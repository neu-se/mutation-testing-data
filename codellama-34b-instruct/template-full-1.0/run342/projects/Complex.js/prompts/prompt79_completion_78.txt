  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a set of conditions that allow the code to continue executing if the current character is a space, tab, or newline, while the new fragment will only allow execution to continue if the current character is not a space, tab, or newline.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '!'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of whitespace characters, while the new fragment will only match an exclamation mark.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of whitespace characters, while the new fragment will only match the letter "a".

DONE.
