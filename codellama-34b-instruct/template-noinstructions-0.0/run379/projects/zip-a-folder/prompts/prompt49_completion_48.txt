  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a callback function as an argument, which would not be called with this replacement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a callback function as an argument, which would be called with a null value instead of the expected error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a callback function as an argument, which would be called with a different error object than the expected one.

DONE.
