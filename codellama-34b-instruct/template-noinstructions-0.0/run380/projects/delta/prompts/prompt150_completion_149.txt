  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called twice, which would result in the `otherIter` iterator advancing by two elements instead of one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with an argument of 2, which would result in the `otherIter` iterator advancing by two elements instead of one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with an argument of `firstOther.retain - firstLeft`, which would result in the `otherIter` iterator advancing by a different number of elements than the original code.

DONE.
