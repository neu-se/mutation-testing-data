  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is rejected, the `then` method would not be called, and the `fail` method would be called instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is fulfilled with the value `1`, the `then` method would be called with `1` as its argument, and the `fail` method would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is fulfilled with the value `undefined`, the `then` method would be called with `undefined` as its argument, and the `fail` method would not be called.

DONE.
