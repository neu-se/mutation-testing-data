  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `country` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `country` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `country` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `country` is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.hasOwnProperty('timezones')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `country` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `country` has a property called `timezones` that is not inherited from its prototype.

DONE.
