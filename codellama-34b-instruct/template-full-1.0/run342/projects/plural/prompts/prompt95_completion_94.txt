  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?woman$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the word "woman" regardless of the case, but the new code fragment only matches the word "woman" in lowercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches the word "man" in lowercase, but the new code fragment matches the word "man" regardless of the case and also matches the word "woman" in lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?bear$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches the word "man" in lowercase, but the new code fragment matches the word "bear" in lowercase.

DONE.
