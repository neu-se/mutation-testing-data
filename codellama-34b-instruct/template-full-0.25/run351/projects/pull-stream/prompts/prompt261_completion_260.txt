  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `err` argument, which would cause the function to return an error, even if the `err` argument is not an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `err` argument as the second argument, which would cause the function to return the `err` argument as the result, even if the `err` argument is not an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `err` argument as the first argument and `null` as the second argument, which would cause the function to return the `err` argument as the result, even if the `err` argument is not an error.

DONE.
