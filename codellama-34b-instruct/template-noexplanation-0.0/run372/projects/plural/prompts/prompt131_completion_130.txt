  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word)
```
This code fragment is a simpler version of the original code fragment, and it has the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) && word.length > 0
```
This code fragment is a more complex version of the original code fragment, and it has different behavior. The additional condition `word.length > 0` ensures that the rule is only applied to words that have a length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) || word.length === 0
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it has different behavior. The additional condition `word.length === 0` ensures that the rule is applied to words that have a length of 0.

DONE.
