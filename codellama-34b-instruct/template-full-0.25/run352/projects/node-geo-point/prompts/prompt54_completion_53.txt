  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has a different range and output than the `cos` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function has a different range and output than the `cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function has a different range and output than the `cos` function.

DONE.
