  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call the `callback` function with the `arguments` object as its argument list, rather than the original `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to call the `callback` function with the `arguments` object as its argument list, rather than the original `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null, arguments)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to create a new function that calls the `callback` function with the `arguments` object as its argument list, and the new function is immediately invoked with the `()` operator.

DONE.
