  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at the third argument instead of the second, which could cause the method to return a different array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only return the first two arguments instead of all the arguments starting from the second, which could cause the method to return a different array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only return the second argument instead of all the arguments starting from the second, which could cause the method to return a different array of arguments.

DONE.
