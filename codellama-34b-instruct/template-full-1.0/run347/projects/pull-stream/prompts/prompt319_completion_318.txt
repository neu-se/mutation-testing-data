  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null`, which is a valid value, while `undefined` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null`, which is a valid value, while `0` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned `null`, which is a valid value, while `''` is not.

DONE.
