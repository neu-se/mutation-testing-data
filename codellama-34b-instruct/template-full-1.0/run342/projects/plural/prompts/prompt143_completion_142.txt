  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns the type of the operand, while `type` is a string representing the type of the operand.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.valueOf.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf` is a method that returns the primitive value of the object, while `toString` is a method that returns a string representing the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object, which has a `slice` method that returns a new string with a subset of the characters from the original string.

DONE.
