  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is missing, which would cause the `retain` property to be treated as a string instead of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not being checked for the correct value, which would cause the `retain` operation to be applied even if the `retain` property is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not being checked for the correct type, which would cause the `retain` operation to be applied even if the `retain` property is not a string.

DONE.
