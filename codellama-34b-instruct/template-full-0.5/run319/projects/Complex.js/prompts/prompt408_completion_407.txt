  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `temp` would be multiplied by 0, which would always result in 0, regardless of the value of `temp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp - temp
```
This would result in different behavior because `temp` would be subtracted from itself, which would always result in 0, regardless of the value of `temp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `temp` would be added to 1, which would always result in a different value than `temp` alone.

DONE.
