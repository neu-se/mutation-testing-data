  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `decodeURIComponent` function to be called on the `basename` variable, which is not the same as calling it on the `pathname` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `basename` function to be called on the `pathname` variable, which is not the same as calling it on the `decodedBasename` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(pathname.basename)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `decodeURIComponent` function on the `basename` property of the `pathname` object, which is not the same as calling it on the `pathname` variable.

DONE.
