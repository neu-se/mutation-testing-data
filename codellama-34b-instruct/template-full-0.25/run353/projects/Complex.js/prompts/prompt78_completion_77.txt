  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 1 instead of 0, and the last element would be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < tokens.length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop at the second-to-last element instead of the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = tokens.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element instead of the first element, and the order of the elements would be reversed.

DONE.
