  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max()` returns the larger of two or more numbers, whereas `Math.min()` returns the smaller.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value 10, regardless of the actual minimum value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<another variable>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different variable to calculate the minimum value.

DONE.
