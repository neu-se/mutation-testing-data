  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, whereas `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isNaN` checks if a value is not not a number, which is always true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(z)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN(z)` checks if the variable `z` is not a number, whereas the original code fragment checks if the result of the `parse` function is not a number.

DONE.
