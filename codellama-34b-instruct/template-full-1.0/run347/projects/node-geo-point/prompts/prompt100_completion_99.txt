  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `rad2deg` converts an angle in radians to an angle in degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(x, y) => y - x
```
This would result in different behavior because the given code fragment returns a function that subtracts the value of `y` from the value of `x`, whereas `rad2deg` converts an angle in radians to an angle in degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin((Math.random() * 2 - 1) * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` computes the sine of an angle, whereas `rad2deg` converts an angle in radians to an angle in degrees. In addition, `Math.random() * 2 - 1` produces a random number between -
