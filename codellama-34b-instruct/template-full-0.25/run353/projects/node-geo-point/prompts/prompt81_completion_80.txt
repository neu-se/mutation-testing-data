  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude value instead of the longitude value, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the longitude value, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the longitude value by 2, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

DONE.
