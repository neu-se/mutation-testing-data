```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not correctly matching the stack trace line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not correctly matching the stack trace line.
