  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `head` property of the `ends.promise` object instead of the `tail` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail" + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `tail` property of the `ends.promise` object plus the string "1", which would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail" + ends.promise.get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `tail` property of the `ends.promise` object plus the result of calling the `get` method on the `ends.promise` object with the argument "head".

DONE.
