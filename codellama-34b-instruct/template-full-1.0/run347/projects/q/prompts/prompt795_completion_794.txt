  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and in the original code, it is used as a placeholder for the third argument in the `then` method, which is the progress callback. If we replace it with `null`, the promise will be fulfilled with `null`, which will cause the chain to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value in JavaScript, and in the original code, it is used as a placeholder for the third argument in the `then` method, which is the progress callback. If we replace it with `undefined`, the promise will be rejected with an error indicating that the progress callback is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a function, and in the original code, it is used
