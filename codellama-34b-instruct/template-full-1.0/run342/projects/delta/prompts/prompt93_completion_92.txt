  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newOp` is not cloned before being pushed to the `ops` array. In the original code, the `newOp` is cloned using the `cloneDeep` function before being pushed to the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would insert the `newOp` element into the `ops` array at the specified `index`, rather than pushing it to the end of the array like `push` would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops = this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method returns the number of elements in the `ops` array after the new element has been pushed, rather than the `ops` array itself
