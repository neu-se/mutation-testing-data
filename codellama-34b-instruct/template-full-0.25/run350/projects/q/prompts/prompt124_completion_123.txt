  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original condition, causing the `key` to be added to the `keys` array even if it is not an own property of the `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && object[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the `key` to the `keys` array if it is an own property of the `object` and its value is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && typeof object[key] === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the `key` to the `keys` array if it is an own property of the `object` and its value is of type `undefined`.

DONE.
