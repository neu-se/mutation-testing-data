  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `encoding` property of the `options` object as the second argument to `fs.readFileSync()`, instead of passing the `options` object directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `throws` property of the `options` object as the second argument to `fs.readFileSync()`, instead of passing the `options` object directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `reviver` property of the `options` object as the second argument to `fs.readFileSync()`, instead of passing the `options` object directly.

DONE.
