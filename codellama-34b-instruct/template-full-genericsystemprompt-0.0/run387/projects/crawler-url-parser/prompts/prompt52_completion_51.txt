  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the path of the parsed URL instead of the full URL, which could lead to incorrect results in the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the full URL instead of the path, which could lead to incorrect results in the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol + '//' + parsedUrl.host + parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the protocol, host, and path of the parsed URL instead of the full URL, which could lead to incorrect results in the `parse` function.

DONE.
