  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeFrame` function is called with the `stackLine` argument, which is a string representing a stack trace line. The `isNodeFrame` function checks if the `stackLine` string contains the substring "node.js" or "module.js", which indicates that the stack trace line is from a Node.js module. If the `stackLine` string does not contain these substrings, the `isNodeFrame` function returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInternalFrame` function is called with the `stackLine` argument, which is a string representing a stack trace line. The `isInternalFrame` function checks if the `stackLine` string contains the substring "q.js", which indicates that the stack trace line is from the Q.js library. If the `stackLine` string does not contain this substring, the `isInternalFrame` function returns `false`.
