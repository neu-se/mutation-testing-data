  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument, which is the offset, is set to 0, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument, which is the offset, is set to 1, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument, which is the offset, is set to -1, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
