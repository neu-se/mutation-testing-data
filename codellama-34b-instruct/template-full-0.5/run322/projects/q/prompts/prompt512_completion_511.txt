  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_values
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_values` returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, whereas `object_keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` is a function that returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, whereas `Object.keys` is a function that returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` is a function that returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, whereas `Object.keys` and `Object.values` return arrays
