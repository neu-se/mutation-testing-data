 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return Q(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a new resolved promise instead of racing with the provided answerPs array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return Q.defer().promise; }
