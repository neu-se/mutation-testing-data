  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `policy` object directly, while the replacement code uses the `policy.name` property, which may return a different value if the `policy` object has a custom `toString()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the value of the `policy` object as the key in the map, while the replacement code sets the value `null`, which may cause the map to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `policy` object directly, while the replacement code uses the first element of the `policy` array, which may return a different value if the `policy` array has more than one element.

DONE.
