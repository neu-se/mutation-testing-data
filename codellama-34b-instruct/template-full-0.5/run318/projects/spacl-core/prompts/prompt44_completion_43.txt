  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for a forward slash, while the original code fragment matches any character except for a forward slash and a dollar sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+?
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for a forward slash, but it would do so in a non-greedy manner, meaning it would stop at the first occurrence of a forward slash, while the original code fragment matches any character except for a forward slash and a dollar sign in a greedy manner, meaning it would match as many characters as possible before encountering a forward slash or a dollar sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for a forward slash, followed by a forward slash, while the original code fragment matches any character except for a forward slash and a dollar sign
