  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this === Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would always be an instance of `Complex`, even if it was not explicitly created with the `new` keyword.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would always be an instance of `Object`, even if it was not explicitly created with the `new` keyword.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor === Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.constructor` would always be `Complex`, even if it was not explicitly created with the `new` keyword.

DONE.
