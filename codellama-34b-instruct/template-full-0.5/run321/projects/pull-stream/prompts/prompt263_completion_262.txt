  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with a null error, even if there was an error in the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with the data as the error, even if there was no error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with the error as the data, even if there was no error.

DONE.
