  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex makes the regex case-insensitive, so it would match `default.PDF` as well as `default.pdf`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex makes the regex global, so it would match all occurrences of `default.pdf` in the input string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex makes the regex multi-line, so it would match `default.pdf` even if it appears on a different line than the rest of the input string.

DONE.
