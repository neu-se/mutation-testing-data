Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pattern.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be checking if the uppercase version of the pattern is a glob, which could lead to incorrect results if the pattern contains case-sensitive glob characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pattern.replace(GLOBSTAR, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be checking if the pattern with all globstar characters removed is a glob, which would ignore the presence of globstar characters in the pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ESCAPE_SYMBOL + pattern
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be checking if the pattern prefixed with an escape symbol is a glob, which could lead to incorrect results if the pattern starts with a character that has a special meaning when escaped.

DONE.
