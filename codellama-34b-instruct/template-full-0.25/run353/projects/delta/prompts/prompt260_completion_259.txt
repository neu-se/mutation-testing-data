  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the `delete` properties of the two `Op` objects instead of the `insert` properties, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the `retain` properties of the two `Op` objects instead of the `insert` properties, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the `insert` property of the first `Op` object with the `delete` property of the second `Op` object, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
