  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is called with the `deferred.reject` function, which is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notify(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is called with the `deferred.reject` function, which is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is called with the `reject` function, which is not a promise.

DONE.
