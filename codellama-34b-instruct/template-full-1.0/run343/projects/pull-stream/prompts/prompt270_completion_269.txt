  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && stream.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.length` checks if the length of the stream is 0, whereas `stream && 'object' === typeof stream` checks if the stream is a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!stream
```
This would result in different behavior because `!stream` checks if the stream is falsy, whereas `stream && 'object' === typeof stream` checks if the stream is truthy and a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.some()
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.some()` checks if any elements in the stream pass a test, whereas `stream && 'object' === typeof stream` checks if the stream is a valid object.

DONE.
