  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `null`.
This would result in different behavior because `null` is falsy, so the `.then()` method would not be called, and the promise returned by `.all()` would be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `undefined`.
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is falsy, so the `.then()` method would not be called, and the promise returned by `.all()` would be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Q.reject()`.
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a rejected promise, so the `.then()` method would not be called, and the promise returned by `.all()` would be rejected.

DONE.
