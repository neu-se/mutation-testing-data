  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `index + 1` would add one to the index instead of insert the value at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `index - 1` would subtract one from the index instead of insert the value at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `index * 2` would multiply the index by two instead of insert the value at the specified index.

DONE.
