  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will reject the promise immediately, whereas `Q` is a promise library and would not cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` will resolve the promise immediately, whereas `Q` is a promise library and would not cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, whereas `Q` is a promise library and would not cause the promise to be deferred.

DONE.
