  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of the `_writeFile` function, and it would not return a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile.bind(null, file, obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original `_writeFile` function with the specified `file`, `obj`, and `options` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
async () => {
  await _writeFile(file, obj, options)
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new asynchronous function that, when called, will call the original `_writeFile` function with the specified `file`, `obj`, and `options` arguments, and then return a promise that resolves to the result of the `_writeFile` function.

DONE.
