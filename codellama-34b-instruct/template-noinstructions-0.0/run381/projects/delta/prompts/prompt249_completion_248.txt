  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the length of the current operation in the `thisIter` iterator, rather than the length of the operation in the `otherIter` iterator. This would cause the `diffResult` to be calculated incorrectly, leading to a different final result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(otherIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the length of the current operation in the `otherIter` iterator, rather than the length of the operation in the `thisIter` iterator. This would cause the `diffResult` to be calculated incorrectly, leading to a different final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(length, Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength()));
```
