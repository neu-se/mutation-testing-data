  Sure, I can generate mutants of the code fragment you provided:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a value `null` instead of forwarding the error to `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `abort` error instead of forwarding the error to `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `value` instead of forwarding the error to `cb`.

DONE.
