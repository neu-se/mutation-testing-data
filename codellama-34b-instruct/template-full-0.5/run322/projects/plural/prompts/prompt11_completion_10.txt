  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }

This would result in different behavior because it would produce the wrong output for words that end with "y" but not "ies". For example, "party" would become "parties" instead of "parties".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce the wrong output for words that end with "y" but not "ies". For example, "party" would become "partyy" instead of "parties".
