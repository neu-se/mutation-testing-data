  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the length of the op, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract 1 from the length of the op, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always double the length of the op, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly in certain situations.

DONE.
