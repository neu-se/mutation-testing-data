  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pipe` method is used to stream data from one stream to another, but it is not used to write data to a file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.write(output);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write` method is used to write data to a file, but it is not used to stream data from one stream to another.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is used to finish writing data to a file, but it is not used to stream data from one stream to another.

DONE.
