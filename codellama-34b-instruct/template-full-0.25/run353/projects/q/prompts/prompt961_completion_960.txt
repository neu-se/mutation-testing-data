  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `0` constant, which is falsy, while the replacement code fragment uses the `1` constant, which is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `0` constant, which is falsy, while the replacement code fragment uses the string `"hello"`, which is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `0` constant, which is falsy, while the replacement code fragment uses the `null` value, which is falsy.

DONE.
