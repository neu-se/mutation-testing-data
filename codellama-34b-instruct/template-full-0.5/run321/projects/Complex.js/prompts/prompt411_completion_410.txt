  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `a` and `b` are zero, while this new code checks if either `a` or `b` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `a` and `b` are not zero, while this new code checks if neither `a` nor `b` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 || b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `a` and `b` are zero, while this new code checks if either `a` or `b` is positive.

DONE.
