  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same value for all ops, regardless of their actual attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!predicate(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite value of the original predicate for all ops.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true for every other op, regardless of their actual attributes.

DONE.
