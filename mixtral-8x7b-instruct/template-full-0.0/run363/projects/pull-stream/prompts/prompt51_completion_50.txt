 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the new value returned by the function would be the numeric sum of the `s` variable and 1, instead of the original value of the `s` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof s
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return a string indicating the type of the `s` variable, instead of the original value of the `s` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s !== s
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `s !== s` is always `false`, so the function would effectively stop processing further arguments and return the `read` value unchanged.

DONE.
