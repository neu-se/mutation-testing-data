  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that would be called with the error as an argument, while this new code fragment would call `deferred.reject()` with the error as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that would be called with the error as an argument, while this new code fragment would call `deferred.notify()` with the error as an argument, which would cause the promise to be notified of the error, but not rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`
