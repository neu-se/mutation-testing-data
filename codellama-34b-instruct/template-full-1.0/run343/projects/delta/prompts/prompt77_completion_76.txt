  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (Object.prototype.toString.call(lastOp) === '[object Object]') {
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` is a built-in method that returns the string representation of an object, which may be different from the expected object type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (lastOp instanceof Object) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a particular type, which may not always be the case if the object is created using a different prototype or constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof lastOp == 'Object') {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks the type of an operand, but may not be able to distinguish between objects of different types if they share the same prototype or constructor.

DONE.
