  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a single forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the new code uses a backslash, which could cause the code to interpret the path differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a single backslash to escape the forward slash, while the new code uses two backslashes, which could cause the code to interpret the path differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/' + '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a single forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the new code uses a forward slash followed by a backslash, which could cause the code to interpret the path differently.

DONE.
