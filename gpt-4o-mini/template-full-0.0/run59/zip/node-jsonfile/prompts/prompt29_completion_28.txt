Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the built-in `JSON.stringify` method instead of the custom `stringify` function, which may not handle certain cases (like circular references or specific formatting) the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the object to a string using the `toString` method, which may not produce a valid JSON string representation, leading to potential errors when trying to parse it later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, { space: 2 })
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a formatting option to the `stringify` function, which could change the output to a pretty-printed JSON string, potentially affecting how the data is stored and read back.

DONE.
