  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator over the keys of the `Map` object, rather than the values. This would cause the `gettype()` function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator over the key-value pairs of the `Map` object, rather than just the values. This would cause the `gettype()` function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.values().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method returns a new `Array` object with the elements in reverse order, rather than modifying the original `Array` object. This would cause the `gettype()` function
