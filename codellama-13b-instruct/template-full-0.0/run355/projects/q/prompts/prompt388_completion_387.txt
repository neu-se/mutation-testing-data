  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with two `null` arguments, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` if the `value` argument is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(undefined, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with two `undefined` arguments, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` if the `value` argument is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() {}, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with two functions as arguments, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the return value of the first function if the `value` argument is a promise, or rejected with the return value of the second function if
