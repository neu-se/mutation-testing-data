  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback` is a function in the original code, and checking if it's null would always return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback` is a function in the original code, and checking if it's undefined would always return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback` is a function in the original code, and checking if it's the `reject` function would always return false.

DONE.
