 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'b' + Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the string 'b' with the first key of the object `b`, instead of just using the first key as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns null, while the original code throws an error if the types are not matched.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the string '0', while the original code returns the first key of the object `b`.

DONE.
