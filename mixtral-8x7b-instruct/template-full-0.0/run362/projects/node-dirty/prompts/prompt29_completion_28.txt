 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `.has` returns a boolean indicating if the key is present in the Map, while `.get` returns the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.prototype.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `.prototype` is used to access the prototype of an object, and it doesn't have a `get` method. This would cause a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `.set` is used to add or update a key-value pair in the Map, not to retrieve the value associated with a key. This would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the actual value.

DONE.
