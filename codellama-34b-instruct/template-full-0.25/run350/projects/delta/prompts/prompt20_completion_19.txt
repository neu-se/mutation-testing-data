  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the objects being compared, which could lead to different results in the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b && a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only compare the properties of `b` that are also present in `a`, which could lead to different results in the `diff` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only compare the properties of `a` that are also present in `b`, which could lead to different results in the `diff` function.

DONE.
