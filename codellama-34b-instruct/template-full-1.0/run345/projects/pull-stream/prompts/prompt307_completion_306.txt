  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read function to return null values instead of the expected data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read function to return null values instead of the expected data, and the first argument would indicate an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read function to return null values instead of the expected data, and the third argument would be an unexpected extra argument.

DONE.
