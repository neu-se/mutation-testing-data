  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` would call the `terminate` function, which would set the `last` variable to `false` and call the `cb` function with an error or `true`. In contrast, the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would call the `cb` function with `null` and `data`, which would not set the `last` variable to `false` and would not call the `terminate` function.
