  Sure, I can do that! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments that would result in different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `this.longitude, point.longitude`. This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would now be called with the longitude values of both points, which would produce a different result than the original code fragment which only used the latitude values of both points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `this.latitude + point.latitude`. This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would now be called with the sum of the latitude values of both points, which would produce a different result than the original code fragment which only used the latitude values of both points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `this.longitude + point.longitude`. This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would now be called with the sum of the longitude values of both points, which would produce a different result
