  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `Math.pow` function to calculate the tile coordinates, while the new code uses a random number between 0 and 10, which would result in completely different tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.pow(2, zoom) - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `Math.pow` function to calculate the tile coordinates, while the new code uses a different formula that subtracts 1 from the power of 2, which would result in different tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil((coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `Math.floor` function to calculate the tile coordinates, while the new
