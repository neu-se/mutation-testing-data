  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes()` checks if the array contains a certain value, whereas `array_indexOf()` checks the index of the value in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.contains(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `contains()` is not a valid method on arrays in JavaScript.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.findIndex(promise) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `findIndex()` returns the index of the found value, whereas `array_indexOf()` returns the value itself.

DONE.
