  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the callback function `cb`, while this new code fragment simply calls the callback function `cb` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the callback function `cb`, while this new code fragment calls the callback function `cb` with `null` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the callback function `cb`, while this new code fragment calls the callback function `cb` with `undefined` as the second argument.

DONE.
