  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `retain` property is explicitly checked for being a number, whereas in this new code fragment, any non-undefined value will result in the `return` statement being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `retain` property is explicitly checked for being a number, whereas in this new code fragment, any object-type value will result in the `return` statement being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain instanceof Number
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `retain` property is explicitly checked for being a number, whereas in this new code fragment, any object of type `Number` will result in the `return` statement being executed.

DONE.
