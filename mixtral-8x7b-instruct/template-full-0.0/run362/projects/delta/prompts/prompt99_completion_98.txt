 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index, '0', newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the second argument to a string, which would cause `splice` to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index, -1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to remove the last element of the array, which could cause unexpected changes to the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to insert `newOp` at the next index instead of the current one, which could cause unexpected changes to the `ops` array.

DONE.
