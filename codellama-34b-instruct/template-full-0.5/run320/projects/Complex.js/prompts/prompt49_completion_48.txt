  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `typeof a === 'number'` checks if the value is of type number. This could cause the function to return a different result for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `a > 0` checks if the value is greater than 0. This could cause the function to return a different result for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `a !== Infinity` checks if the value is not equal to infinity. This could cause the function to return a different result for certain inputs.

DONE
