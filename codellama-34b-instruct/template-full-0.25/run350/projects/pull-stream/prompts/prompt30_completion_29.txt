  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array being accessed is different. In the original code, the index is `2`, but in the mutated code, it is `3`. This could cause the function to access a different element of the array, which could lead to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array being accessed is different. In the original code, the index is `2`, but in the mutated code, it is `0`. This could cause the function to access a different element of the array, which could lead to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array being accessed is different. In the original code, the index is `2`, but in the mutated code, it is `1`. This could cause the function to access a
