  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, whereas the original code fragment returned a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a resolved promise, whereas the original code fragment returned a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Different error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different, which could cause the test to fail if it is not expecting the new error message.

DONE.
