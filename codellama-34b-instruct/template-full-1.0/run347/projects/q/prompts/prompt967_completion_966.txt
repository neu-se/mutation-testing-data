  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the spread syntax to concatenate all the arguments into a single array. However, this code fragment creates an empty array and then concatenates the rest of the arguments using `Array.prototype.slice.call`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){}).bind(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new function using the `Function` constructor and then calls it with the provided arguments. This code fragment creates a function expression that returns `undefined` and then calls `Function.prototype.bind` with `null` as the `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;return this;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new instance of `Promise` constructed with the provided arguments. This code fragment returns `this`, which is
