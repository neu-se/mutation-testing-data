 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with `true` (indicating the end of the iteration) once the initial check is performed, even if the array has elements left to iterate over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would stop the iteration once the length of the array and the index are equal, which means that the last element might not be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.indexOf(i) !== -1
