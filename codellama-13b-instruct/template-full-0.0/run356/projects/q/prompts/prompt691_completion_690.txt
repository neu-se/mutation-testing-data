  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `dispatch` method starting from the second argument, instead of the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `dispatch` method starting from the third argument, instead of the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `dispatch` method starting from the fourth argument, instead of the first argument.

DONE.
