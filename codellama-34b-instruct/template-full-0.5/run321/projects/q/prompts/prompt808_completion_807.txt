  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q["finally"]` method would be called on `null`, which would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q["finally"]` method would be called on `undefined`, which would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q["finally"]` method would be called on a rejected promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error message "error".

DONE.
