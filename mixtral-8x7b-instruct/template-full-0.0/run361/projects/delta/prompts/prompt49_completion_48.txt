 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to use a string as an object key, which would cause an error in strict mode or return `undefined` in non-strict mode.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Symbol()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Symbol()` is not a valid object key type, and attempting to use it as such would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random floating-point number, which would not match the expected string or symbol key type.

DONE.
