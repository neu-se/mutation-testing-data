  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduceRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduceRight` iterates over the elements of the array in reverse order, whereas `reduce` iterates over them in forward order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array by concatenating the existing elements of the array, whereas `reduce` performs a cumulative operation on the elements of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new array with all but the first element of the original array, whereas `reduce` iterates over all the elements of the array.

DONE.
