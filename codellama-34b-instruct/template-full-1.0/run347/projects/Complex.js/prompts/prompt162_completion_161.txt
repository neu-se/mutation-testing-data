  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would result in the expression evaluating to `false` when `z` is infinite, rather than `true` as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaNN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaNN` method checks if the imaginary part of `z` is `NaN`, which is not the same as checking if `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method checks if the real and imaginary parts of `z` are both `0`, which is not the same as checking if `z` is infinite.

DONE.
