  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'LineString'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'LineString' is a valid type for a geojson point, but the current code would not catch it as it is only checking for the type 'Point'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would catch cases where the point has more than 2 coordinates, which is not allowed for a geojson point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0] > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would catch cases where the first coordinate of the point is greater than 180, which is not allowed for a geojson point.

DONE.
