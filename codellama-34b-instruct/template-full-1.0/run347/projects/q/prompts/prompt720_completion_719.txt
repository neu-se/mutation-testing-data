  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred();
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `deferred` method immediately, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the deferred object with no arguments, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the deferred object with no arguments, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
