  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with "appendix" or "index", while the new code fragment matches words that end with "appendix" or "index" regardless of case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with "appendix" or "index" case-insensitively, while the new code fragment matches words that end with "appendix" or "index" case-sensitively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with "appendix" or "index" globally, while the new code fragment matches words that end with "appendix" or "index" globally and case-insensitively.

DONE.
