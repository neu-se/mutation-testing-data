  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always retain the same number of characters, regardless of the length of the other op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = otherOp.retain + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one more character than the other op, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = otherOp.retain - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one fewer character than the other op, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
