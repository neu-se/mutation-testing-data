  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would give the plural form of the word "bacterium" as "bacterium" instead of "bacteria".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
‘bacteria’ + ‘s’
```
This would result in different behavior because it would give the plural form of the word "bacterium" as "bacteria + s" (i.e., "bacterias") instead of "bacteria".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
‘Bacterium’ + ‘s’
```
This would result in different behavior because it would give the plural form of the word "bacterium" as "Bacterium + s" (i.e., "Bacteriums") instead of "bacteria".

DONE.
