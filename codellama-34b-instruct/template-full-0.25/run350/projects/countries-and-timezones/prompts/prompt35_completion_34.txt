  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(input / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.floor(offset / 60)`, which rounds the result down to the nearest integer, while the new code rounds up to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(input / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.floor(offset / 60)`, which rounds the result down to the nearest integer, while the new code rounds up to the nearest integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(input / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.floor(offset / 60)`, which rounds the result down to the nearest integer, while the new code rounds to the nearest integer.

DONE.
