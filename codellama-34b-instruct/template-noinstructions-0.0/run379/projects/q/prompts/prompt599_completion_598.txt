  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing all the arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments except the first one to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing all the arguments as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(args[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments and the first argument again to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing all the arguments as an array.

DONE.
