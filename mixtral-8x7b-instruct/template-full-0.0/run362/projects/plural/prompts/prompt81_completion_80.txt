 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'goat', 'goats'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule was for a special case of irregular plurals, while this new rule is a regular plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'child', 'children'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule was for a special case of irregular plurals, while this new rule is for an irregular plural with a different pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'octopus', 'octopi'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule was for a special case of irregular plurals, while this new rule is a commonly cited but incorrect irregular plural form.

DONE.
