  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log($(this).text);
```
This would result in logging the text content of the element instead of returning it, which would cause the extract function to return an unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this;
```
This would result in returning the node reference instead of the text content, which would cause the extract function to return an unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text = "some other text";
```
This would result in modifying the text content of the node, which would cause the extract function to return an unexpected result.

DONE.
