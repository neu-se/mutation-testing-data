  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `query` method on the `policy` object with the `path`, `verb`, and `ctx` arguments, which would return a boolean value indicating whether the action is allowed or not. In contrast, the original code fragment `policy.query` would return a function that takes the `path`, `verb`, and `ctx` arguments and returns a boolean value indicating whether the action is allowed or not.
