  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would pass the `reason` variable as the rejection reason, while the replaced code would always pass `1` as the rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would pass the `reason` variable as the rejection reason, while the replaced code would always pass the string `"error"` as the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would pass the `reason` variable as the rejection reason, while the replaced code would always pass `undefined` as the rejection reason.

DONE.
