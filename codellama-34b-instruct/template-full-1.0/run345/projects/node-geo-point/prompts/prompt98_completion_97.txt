  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x ** 2 // this would result in different behavior because the square of the value would be used, whereas the original code used the value as is.
```
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x // this would result in different behavior because the negative of the value would be used, whereas the original code used the value as is.
```
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x % 2 // this would result in different behavior because the modulo of the value and 2 would be used, whereas the original code used the value as is.
```
DONE.
