  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush + 1` would be a different function than `flush`, and the test suite would not be able to detect the bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush - 1` would be a different function than `flush`, and the test suite would not be able to detect the bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush * 2` would be a different function than `flush`, and the test suite would not be able to detect the bug.

DONE.
