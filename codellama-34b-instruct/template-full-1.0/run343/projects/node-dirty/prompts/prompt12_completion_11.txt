  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`null`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be called on `null` instead of the original key. In the original code, `get` is called on `this._queue`, which is a `Map` object. If the code is replaced with `null`, the `get` method will not be defined, and an error will be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`""`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be called on an empty string instead of the original key. In the original code, `get` is called on `this._queue`, which is a `Map` object. If the code is replaced with an empty string, the `get` method will return `undefined`, which may cause unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`"key"`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be called on the string
