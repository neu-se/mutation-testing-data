  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments).slice(2)` would create a new array that excludes the first two elements of the `arguments` object, whereas `arguments` would include all elements of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(arguments).slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(arguments).slice(2)` would create a new array that includes all enumerable property values of the `arguments` object, but excludes the first two elements, whereas `arguments` would include all elements of the `arguments` object, including non-enumerable properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice.call(arguments, 2)` would create a new array that includes all elements of the `arguments
