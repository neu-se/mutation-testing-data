  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the real part would be inverted, causing the resulting complex number to have a different real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (c + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part would be increased by 1, causing the resulting complex number to have a different real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (c * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part would be doubled, causing the resulting complex number to have a different real part.

DONE.
