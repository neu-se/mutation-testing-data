  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different method than `all` that returns the first resolved promise of an array, whereas `all` returns a promise for an array of the corresponding values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` is a different method than `all` that returns a promise that is rejected if any of the promises in the array are rejected, whereas `all` returns a promise for an array of the corresponding values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a different method than `all` that returns a promise for an array of states (as returned by `inspect`) when they have all settled, whereas `all` returns a promise for an array of the corresponding values.

DONE.
