  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the `reviver` function to `JSON.parse()`, which would cause the function to use the default reviver function instead of the one provided in the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the `reviver` function to `JSON.parse()`, which would cause the function to use the default reviver function instead of the one provided in the `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` value would be passed as the `reviver` function to `JSON.parse()`, which would cause the function to use the default revi
