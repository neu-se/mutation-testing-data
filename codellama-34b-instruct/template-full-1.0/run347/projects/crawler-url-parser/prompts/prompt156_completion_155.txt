  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[$]/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the $ character has been removed, which could change the results of the regex pattern match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\;
```
This would result in different behavior because the semicolon character would not be matched by the regex pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value would not be matched by the regex pattern.

DONE.
