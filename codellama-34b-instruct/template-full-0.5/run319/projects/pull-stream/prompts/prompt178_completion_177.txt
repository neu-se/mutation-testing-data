  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` callback is not being passed to the `abortCb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` and `onAbort` arguments are not being passed to the `abortCb` function.

DONE.
