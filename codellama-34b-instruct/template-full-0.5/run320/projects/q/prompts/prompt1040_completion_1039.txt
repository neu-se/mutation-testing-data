  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a deferred object, while this replacement returns a promise object. This could cause issues in the `put` and `get` methods, which rely on the deferred object's `resolve` and `reject` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a deferred object, while this replacement returns a rejected promise object. This could cause issues in the `put` and `get` methods, which rely on the deferred object's `resolve` and `reject` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a deferred object, while this replacement returns a resolved promise object with a value of `null`. This could cause issues in the `put
