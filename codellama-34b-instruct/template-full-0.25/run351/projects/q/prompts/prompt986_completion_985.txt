  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a different HTTP method than "post", and the server may not handle it correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because "head" is a different HTTP method than "post", and the server may not handle it correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is a different HTTP method than "post", and the server may not handle it correctly.

DONE.
