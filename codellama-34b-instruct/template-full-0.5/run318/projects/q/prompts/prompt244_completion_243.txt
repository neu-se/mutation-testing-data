  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.bind(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value bound to `resolvedPromise`, which would cause the `inspect` method to be called on a different object than the one it was originally called on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` sets the `this` value to `null` when calling the `inspect` method, which would cause the method to be called on a different object than the one it was originally called on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.apply(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` sets the `this` value to `undefined` when calling the `inspect` method, which would cause the method to be called on a different
