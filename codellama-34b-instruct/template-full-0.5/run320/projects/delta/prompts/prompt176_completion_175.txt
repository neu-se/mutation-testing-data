  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue indefinitely, as `length` would never be less than `firstLeft`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLeft - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to end prematurely, as `firstLeft - length` would be a negative value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - firstLeft + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one additional time, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

DONE.
