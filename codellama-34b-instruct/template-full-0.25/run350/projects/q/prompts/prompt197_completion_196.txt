  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the stack trace, which may not include the relevant information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the stack trace, which may not include the relevant information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first word of the stack trace, which may not include the relevant information.

DONE.
