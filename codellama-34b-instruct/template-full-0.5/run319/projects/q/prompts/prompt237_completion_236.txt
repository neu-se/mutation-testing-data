  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a truthy value, even if the promise has been resolved, causing the `valueOf` method to always return the promise itself, instead of the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first message in the `messages` array, even if the promise has been resolved, causing the `valueOf` method to always return the first message, instead of the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an array of all messages except the first one, even if the promise has been resolved, causing the `valueOf` method to always return an array of all messages except the first one, instead of the resolved value.

DONE.
