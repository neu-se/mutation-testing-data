  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'people'`, which is the plural form of the word, whereas the new code fragment is `'person'`, which is the singular form of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'people'`, which is the plural form of the word, whereas the new code fragment is `'persons'`, which is the plural form of the word with an extra `s` at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'people'`, which is the plural form of the word, whereas the new code fragment is `'peoples'`, which is the plural form of the word with an extra `s` at the end and an extra `e` at the end.
