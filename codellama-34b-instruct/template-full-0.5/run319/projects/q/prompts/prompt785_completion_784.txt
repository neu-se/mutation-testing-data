  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (reason) {
    throw reason;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the reason if the callback is not a function, while this new code fragment throws the reason regardless of whether the callback is a function or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (reason) {
    return reason;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the reason if the callback is not a function, while this new code fragment returns the reason regardless of whether the callback is a function or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
