  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the compression level to be set to a value other than "uncompressed", which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the compression level to be set to a value other than "uncompressed", which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the compression level to be set to a value other than "uncompressed", which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
