Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which would lead to incorrect calculations for the exponential function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the real part of the complex number, which would change the output of the exponential function, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it computes the logarithm of the real part instead of using the real part directly, which would yield a different value and affect the final result of the exponential calculation.

DONE.
