  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the result of `test.test(data)` instead of the original code which would return the test if it's an object and has a `test` property, or the property `prop` (if it exists) or the function `id` if it is not an object or does not have a `test` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[test]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property `test` of the `data` object, instead of the result of the function `test` if it is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.prop[test]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property `test` of the `data.prop` object, instead of the `test` property of the `data` object.

DONE.
