  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `min` to 0, which allows the matcher to match an empty string. Setting `min` to 1 would require at least one character to be matched.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `max` to 0, which allows the matcher to match any number of characters. Setting `max` to 1 would limit the matcher to matching only one character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes a non-empty string onto the `parts` array. Pushing an empty string would cause the matcher to match an empty string, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
