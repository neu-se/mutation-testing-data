 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation in the `this` Delta instead of the `other` Delta, which could lead to incorrect deletion lengths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set a fixed maximum deletion length of 1000, which could lead to incorrect deletion lengths if the actual length is smaller or larger.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
opLength - 1
