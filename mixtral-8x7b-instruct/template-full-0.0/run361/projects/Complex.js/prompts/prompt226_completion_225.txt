 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(1 - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square root of a value that is always 1 minus the real part of the complex number, instead of just the square root of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it squares the real part of the complex number instead of calculating the square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the absolute value of the real part of the complex number instead of the square root.

DONE.
