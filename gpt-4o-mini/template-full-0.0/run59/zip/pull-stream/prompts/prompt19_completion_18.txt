Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to the `pull` function from the first element of the `ref` array to the second element, potentially altering the expected behavior of the function if the first and second elements are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as an argument to the `pull` function would likely lead to unexpected results or errors, as it would not provide a valid value for the function to operate on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of the expected value could lead to different execution paths or errors, as the function may not handle `undefined` as a valid input in the same way it would handle a defined value.

DONE.
