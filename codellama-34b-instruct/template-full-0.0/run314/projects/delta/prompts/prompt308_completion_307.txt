  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with an empty object `{}` as the second argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, line.attributes, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with the `line` object's `attributes` property as the second argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, other.attributes, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with the `other` object's `attributes` property as the second argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
