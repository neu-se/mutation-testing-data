  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values in the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the key-value pairs in the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.keys` is a function that returns an array of the keys in the object, whereas `Object.keys` is a function that returns an array of the keys in the object, but only if the object has an own property with that name.

DONE.
