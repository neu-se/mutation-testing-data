  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/\?/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query on "&" characters, while the modified code fragment splits it on "?" characters, which would result in different array contents and potentially different query parameter counts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/\&/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query on "&" characters, while the modified code fragment splits it on "&" characters, which would result in different array contents and potentially different query parameter counts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/\?|&/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query on "&" characters, while the modified code fragment splits it on both "?" and "&" characters, which would result in different array contents and
