  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the less-than operator, while this one uses the equality operator. With this change, the function will return `cb(true)` only when `i` is exactly equal to `max`, while the original code would return `cb(true)` when `i` is greater than `max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the less-than operator, while this one uses the greater-than-or-equal-to operator. With this change, the function will return `cb(true)` only when `i` is greater than or equal to `max`, while the original code would return `cb(true)` when `i` is greater than `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1 > max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the less-than
