 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `has` returns a boolean indicating whether an element exists in the map, while `get` returns the value associated with the key if it exists, or `undefined` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.set
