  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the value of the key to `val`, regardless of whether `val` is undefined or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val || null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to set the value of the key to `null` if `val` is undefined, rather than deleting the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val || this._data.get(key));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to set the value of the key to the current value of the key if `val` is undefined, rather than deleting the key.

DONE.
