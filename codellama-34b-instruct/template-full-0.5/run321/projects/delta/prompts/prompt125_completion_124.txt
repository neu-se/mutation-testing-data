  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the length of the ops array, while this new code returns the length of the current Delta object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops.length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the length of the ops array, while this new code returns the length of the current Delta object plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops.length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the length of the ops array, while this new code returns the length of the current Delta object minus one.

DONE.
