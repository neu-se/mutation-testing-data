  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= length; i++
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate one extra time, which may cause the function to produce incorrect results or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length - 1; i++
```
This change will cause the loop to skip the last element in the `arguments` array, which may cause the function to produce incorrect results or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length; i += 2
```
This change will cause the loop to skip every other element in the `arguments` array, which may cause the function to produce incorrect results or throw an error.

DONE.
