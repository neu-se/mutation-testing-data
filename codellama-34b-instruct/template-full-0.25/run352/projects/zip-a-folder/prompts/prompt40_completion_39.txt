  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of individual characters, rather than an array of substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(' ', 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of substrings, but only include the first two substrings in the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of substrings, but would not include any empty strings in the resulting array.

DONE.
