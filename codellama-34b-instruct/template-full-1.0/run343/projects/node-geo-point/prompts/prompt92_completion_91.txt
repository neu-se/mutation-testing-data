  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is a trigonometric function, and adding `θ` as an argument would change the output of the function, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` and `sin` are trigonometric functions related to each other, and changing one of them would affect the output of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation would now include division by a constant, which could change the scale of the output.

DONE.
