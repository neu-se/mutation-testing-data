  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value + 1]
```
This code fragment will increment the value of the `key` property by 1 before setting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value * 2]
```
This code fragment will double the value of the `key` property before setting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value - 1]
```
This code fragment will decrement the value of the `key` property by 1 before setting it.

DONE.
