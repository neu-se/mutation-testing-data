  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `task` function without any arguments, while this new code fragment is calling it with an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `task` function without any context, while this new code fragment is calling it with a context of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the `task` function without any arguments, while this new code fragment is calling it with an empty array of arguments.

DONE.
