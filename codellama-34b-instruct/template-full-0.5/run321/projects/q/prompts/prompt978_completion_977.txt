  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.ninvoke(object, name, args).then(function(result) {
    deferred.resolve(result);
}, function(error) {
    deferred.reject(error);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not use the `nodeArgs` array, which is used to store the arguments for the method being invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.ninvoke(object, name, args).then(function(result) {
    deferred.resolve(result);
}, function(error) {
    deferred.reject(error);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not use the `deferred` object, which is used to create a new promise that is resolved or rejected based on the result of the method being invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.ninvoke(object, name, args).then(function(result) {
