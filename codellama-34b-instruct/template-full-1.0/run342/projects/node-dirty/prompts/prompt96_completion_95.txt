  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key' in row === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the !== operator checks for not only the absence of a property but also checks if the property is set to null which is not the behavior of the original code which only checks if the property is not set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key !== row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the !== operator checks for the inequality of the values of the two operands which is not the behavior of the original code which checks if the key is not set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the delete operator removes the key from the object which is not the behavior of the original code which checks if the key is not set.

DONE.
