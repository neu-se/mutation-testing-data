  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(c => c.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while the `map` method returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while the `map` method returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce((acc, c) => acc.concat(c), [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value
