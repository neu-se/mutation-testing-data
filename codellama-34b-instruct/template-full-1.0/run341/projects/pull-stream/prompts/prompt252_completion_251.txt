  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_read
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `_read`, causing the `nextChunk` function to be called instead of the `nextStream` function when `_read` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
~_read
```
This would result in different behavior because the `~` operator inverts the bits of `_read`, causing the `nextChunk` function to be called instead of the `nextStream` function when `_read` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, causing the `nextChunk` function to be called only when `_read` is both non-null and equal to `true`.

DONE.
