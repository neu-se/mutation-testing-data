  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the `type` property exists, but this new code checks if both `type` and `coordinates` properties exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') || point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `type` and `coordinates` properties exist, but this new code only checks if either property exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `type` and `coordinates` properties exist, but this new code checks if `type` exists and `coordinates` does not exist.

DONE.
