  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `null` to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, which would likely cause an error in the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `nodeArgs` array, which would likely cause an error in the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[0] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the first element of the `nodeArgs` array to `null`, which would likely cause an error in the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function.

DONE.
