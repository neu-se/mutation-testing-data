Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
canonicalizedObj
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for property ownership on the newly created `canonicalizedObj` instead of the original `obj`, potentially skipping properties that were added during the canonicalization process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, effectively skipping all properties of the object, leading to an empty object being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for property ownership on the global `window` object instead of the `obj`, potentially including properties that are not relevant to the object being canonicalized.

DONE.
