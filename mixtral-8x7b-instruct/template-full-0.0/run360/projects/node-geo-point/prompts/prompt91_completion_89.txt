 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(θ + Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the sine of the negative angle, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-Math.sin(θ)
