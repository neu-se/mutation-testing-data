  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be subtracting 1 from the length of the string, which would cause the loop to iterate one fewer times than it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the length of the string, which would cause the loop to iterate one more time than it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be doubling the length of the string, which would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times as it should.

DONE.
