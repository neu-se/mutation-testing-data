 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of cloning the `newOp` object. This change would cause the `push` method to behave differently, potentially leading to incorrect insertions or modifications of the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `newOp` to null. This change would cause an error in the `push` method when checking the type of `lastOp`, as it would not be able to compare `null` with an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<any>
```
This would result in different behavior because it casts `newOp` to the `any` type. This change would allow TypeScript to bypass the type checking, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the `push` method when comparing properties of `newOp` and `lastOp`.

DONE.
