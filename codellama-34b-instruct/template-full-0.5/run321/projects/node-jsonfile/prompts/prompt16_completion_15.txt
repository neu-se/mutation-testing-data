Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `_writeFile`, and it has a different return value. `_writeFileSync` returns nothing, while `_writeFile` returns a promise that resolves to the contents of the
