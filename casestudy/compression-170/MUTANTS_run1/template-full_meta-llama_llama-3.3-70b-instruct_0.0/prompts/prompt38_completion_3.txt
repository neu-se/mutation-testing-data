Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.statusCode + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to write a different status code to the response headers, potentially causing issues with the HTTP response.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.statusCode
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `statusCode` property of the `res` object instead of `this`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `this` is not bound to the `res` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
req.statusCode
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to use the `statusCode` property of the `req` object, which does not exist, potentially causing a runtime error.

DONE.
