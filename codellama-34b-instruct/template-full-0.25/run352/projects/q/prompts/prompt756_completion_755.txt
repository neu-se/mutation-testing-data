  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a different function that returns a promise for an array of promises, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of promises that have been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different function that returns a promise for the first resolved promise of an array, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of resolved promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different function that returns a promise for an array of resolved promises, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of promises that have been resolved.

DONE.
