  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex is now checking for a slash at the beginning of the string, whereas the original code was checking for the absence of a slash at the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!spec.match(/^\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex is now checking for the presence of a slash at the beginning of the string, whereas the original code was checking for the absence of a slash at the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^ +/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex is now checking for one or more spaces at the beginning of the string, whereas the original code was checking for the absence of a slash at the beginning of the string.

DONE.
