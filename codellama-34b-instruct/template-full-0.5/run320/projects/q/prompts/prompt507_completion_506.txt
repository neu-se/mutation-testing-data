  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `args` array as the second argument to `value[name].apply()`, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array without the first element as the second argument to `value[name].apply()`, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, [args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array containing only the first element of the `args` array as the second argument to `value[name].apply()`, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

DONE.
