  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the frame is an internal frame in Node, whereas the original code was checking if the frame is an internal frame in Q.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(stackLine, "isInternalFrame")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the stackLine has an "isInternalFrame" property, whereas the original code was checking if the frame is an internal frame in Q.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof isInternalFrame === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if "isInternalFrame" is a function, whereas the original code was checking if the frame is an internal frame in Q.

DONE.
