Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev.concat({ [key]: tzs[key] });
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array and does not merge objects, leading to a loss of the original object structure and potentially causing issues when accessing the timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign(prev, { [key]: null });
```
This would result in different behavior because assigning `null` to the timezone would mean that the timezone data is lost, resulting in an object that does not contain the expected timezone information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[key] = tzs[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because this code directly assigns the timezone to the `prev` object, which could lead to overwriting existing properties instead of merging them, potentially losing other timezone data.

DONE.
