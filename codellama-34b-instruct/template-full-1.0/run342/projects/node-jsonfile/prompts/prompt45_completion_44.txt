  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj, options` expects both `obj` and `options` to be valid objects, while replacing it with `null` would result in a `TypeError` as it is not a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj, options` expects both `obj` and `options` to be valid objects, while replacing it with `undefined` would result in a `TypeError` as it is not a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj, options` expects both `obj` and `options` to be valid objects, while replacing it with an empty object `{}` would not result in a `TypeError` but would still change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
