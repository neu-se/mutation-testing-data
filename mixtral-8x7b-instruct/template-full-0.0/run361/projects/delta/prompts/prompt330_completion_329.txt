 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the length of the next operation in the current iterator, rather than the length of the operation itself. This could lead to incorrect calculations when applying the delta inversion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0 as the length, which would lead to incorrect delta inversion results. This is because the length of the operation is not taken into account when applying the inversion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the length of the first operation in the current iterator, rather than the length of the operation itself. This could lead to incorrect calculations when applying the delta inversion.

DONE.
