  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is replaced with `set`, which would cause the code to set the property value instead of getting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is replaced with `delete`, which would cause the code to delete the property instead of getting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is replaced with `post`, which would cause the code to post the property value instead of getting it.

DONE.
