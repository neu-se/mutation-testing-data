  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `b` to calculate the argument of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses the variable `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `b` to calculate the argument of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses `b + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `b` to calculate the argument of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses `a + b`.

DONE.
