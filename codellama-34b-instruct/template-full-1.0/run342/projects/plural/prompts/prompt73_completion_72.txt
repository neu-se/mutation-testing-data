  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'crows'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return "crows" instead of "cellos" for the word "cello".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', function(w) { return w + 'xes' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return "celloxes" instead of "cellos" for the word "cello".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'havana'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return "havana" instead of "cellos" for the word "cello".

DONE.
