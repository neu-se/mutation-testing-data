  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would not be emitted if the file does not exist, and the `error` event would be emitted instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted even if the file does not exist, and the `error` event would not be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event would be emitted when the file is loaded, regardless of whether the file exists or not.

DONE.
