Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `value` property of the result instead of checking if the result is done, which could lead to incorrect handling of the generator's state and potentially cause unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.done === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `done` property is explicitly `false`, which would incorrectly allow the promise to resolve even when the generator has completed its execution, leading to unexpected behavior in promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.done !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `done` property is not `true`, which could allow the promise to resolve incorrectly when the generator has actually finished, thus breaking the intended flow of asynchronous execution.

DONE.
