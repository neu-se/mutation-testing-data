  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `replacer` is a function that is used to replace values in the JSON string, while `replacer = null` would simply assign the value `null` to the variable `replacer`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = function(key, value) { return value }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `replacer` is a function that is used to replace values in the JSON string, while `replacer = function(key, value) { return value }` would replace all values in the JSON string with the value `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = function(key, value) { return value + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `replacer` is a function that is used to replace values in the JSON string, while `
