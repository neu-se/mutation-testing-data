Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the resolved value to the callback, while using `undefined` would cause the callback to receive `undefined`, potentially leading to unexpected results in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the resolved value to the callback, while using `null` would cause the callback to receive `null`, which may not be the intended value and could affect subsequent operations that depend on the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the resolved value to the callback, it would immediately reject the promise with an error, altering the flow of the promise chain and potentially causing the rejection handler to be invoked instead of the fulfillment handler.

DONE.
