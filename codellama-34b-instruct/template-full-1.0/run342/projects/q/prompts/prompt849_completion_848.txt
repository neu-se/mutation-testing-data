  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was supposed to return a rejected promise with the error object, but it was missing the `Q.reject` method call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was supposed to return a resolved promise with the value, but it was missing the `Q.resolve` method call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.notify(progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was supposed to return a notification promise with the progress value, but it was missing the `Q.notify` method call.

DONE.
