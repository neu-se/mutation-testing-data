  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `attempt2` was truthy, while this new code fragment checks if the second element of `attempt2` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] !== attempt2[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `attempt2` was truthy, while this new code fragment checks if the second element of `attempt2` is not equal to the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] === attempt2[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `attempt2` was truthy, while this new code fragment checks if the second element of `attempt2` is equal to the first element.

DONE.
