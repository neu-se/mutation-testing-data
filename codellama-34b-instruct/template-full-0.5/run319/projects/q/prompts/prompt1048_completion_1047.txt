  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise, whereas `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise. In the original code, `Q.reject` is used to indicate that the queue is closed, and `Q.resolve` is used to indicate that a value has been added to the queue. If `Q.resolve` is used instead of `Q.reject` to indicate that the queue is closed, the `get` method will never throw an error, even if the queue is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array have resolved. In the original code, `Q.all` is used to wait for all of the promises in the queue to resolve before returning the value. If `Q.all` is used instead of `Q.resolve` to indicate
