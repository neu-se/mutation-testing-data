  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive a `null` value instead of an object, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive an empty object instead of an object with properties, which would cause it to return an empty string instead of a JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive an empty array instead of an object, which would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
