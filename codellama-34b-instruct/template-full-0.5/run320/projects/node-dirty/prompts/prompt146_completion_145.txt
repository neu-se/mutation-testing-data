  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'error' is a different event than 'drain', and would cause the callback function to be invoked with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'close' is a different event than 'drain', and would cause the callback function to be invoked with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'data' is a different event than 'drain', and would cause the callback function to be invoked with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
