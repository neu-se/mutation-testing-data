  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 + 1` is always truthy, whereas `resolve` is only truthy when called with one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"resolve"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"resolve"` is a string and not a function, whereas `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `function () { return 42; }` is a function that always returns 42, whereas `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value that is determined by the resolver function.

DONE.
