  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise` is a property that holds the promise object, whereas `defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a given value, whereas `defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a given reason, whereas `defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

DONE.
