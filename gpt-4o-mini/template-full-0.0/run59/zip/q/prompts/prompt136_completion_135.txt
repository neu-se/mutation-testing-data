Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"StopIteration"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the string "StopIteration" to the result of `object_toString`, which would never match, causing the function to always return false for StopIteration exceptions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the current context (`this`) instead of the `exception` variable, leading to incorrect evaluations and potentially causing the function to fail when checking for StopIteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `"[object Undefined]"`, which would not match the expected string representation of a StopIteration exception, thus causing the function to incorrectly handle such exceptions.

DONE.
