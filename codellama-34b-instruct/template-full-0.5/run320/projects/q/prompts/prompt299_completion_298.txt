  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` is a different variable than `x`, and the `join` method would return a promise that resolves to `y`, rather than `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `x + 1` is a different value than `x`, and the `join` method would return a promise that resolves to `x + 1`, rather than `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `x`, and the `join` method would return a promise that resolves to `null`, rather than `x`.

DONE.
