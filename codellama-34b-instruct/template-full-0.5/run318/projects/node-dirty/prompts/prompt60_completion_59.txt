  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeStream` is not the same as the `readStream`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `path` is a string, and it may not have the same properties or methods as a stream object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a Map object, and it may not have the same properties or methods as a stream object.

DONE.
