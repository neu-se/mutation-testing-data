  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push({ retain: 0 });
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the `concat` function would constantly be adding a new delta with a zero retain length to the end of the `ops` array, causing the loop to never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(new Delta());
```
This would result in an error because the `concat` function is expecting a delta with at least one operation, but the new delta would have zero operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding the next operation from the `other` delta to the `ops` array, rather than the same operation as in the original code.

DONE.
