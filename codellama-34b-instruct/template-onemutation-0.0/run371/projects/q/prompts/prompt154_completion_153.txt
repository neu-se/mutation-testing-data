  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate three strings, while the buggy code fragment uses the `+=` operator to concatenate a string and a variable. The `+=` operator will modify the original string, while the `+` operator will create a new string. In this case, the `+=` operator is not appropriate because it will modify the `STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR` variable, which is likely not the intended behavior.

DONE.
