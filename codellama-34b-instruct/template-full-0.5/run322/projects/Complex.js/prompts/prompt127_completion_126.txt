  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return Complex['INFINITY'];`, which would indicate that the result of the division is infinite, whereas the new code fragment would indicate that the result is not a number (NaN).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return Complex['NAN'];`, which would indicate that the result of the division is not a number (NaN), whereas the new code fragment would indicate that the result is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return Complex['INFINITY'];`, which would indicate that the result of the division is infinite, whereas the new code fragment would indicate that the result is zero.

DONE.
