 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+[^/]$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string does not end with a slash, instead of checking if it ends with a slash followed by any character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+[^/]$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string ends with a slash followed by any character, instead of checking if it does not end with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string ends with a slash, instead of checking if the string matches a specific regular expression pattern.

DONE.
