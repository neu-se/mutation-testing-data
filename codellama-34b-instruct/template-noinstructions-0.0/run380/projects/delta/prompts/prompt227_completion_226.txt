  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `component[1]` would refer to the second element of the `component` array, which may not be a valid index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `component[0] + 1` would refer to the second element of the `component` array, which may not be a valid index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `component.length - 1` would refer to the last element of the `component` array, which may not be a valid index.

DONE.
