  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a strict equality check, while this replacement uses a non-strict equality check. This means that if `fn` returns a value that is loosely equal to `true`, the code would enter the `if` block, even if it is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a strict equality check, while this replacement uses a non-strict equality check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== true
```
