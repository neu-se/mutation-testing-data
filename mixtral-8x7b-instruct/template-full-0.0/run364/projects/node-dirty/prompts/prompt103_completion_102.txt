 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` would not be accessed, and if the `row` object does not have a `key` property, it would not throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys().next().value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first key in the `_data` object instead of the key passed in the `row` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'constantKey'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string 'constantKey' instead of the key passed in the `row` object.

DONE.
