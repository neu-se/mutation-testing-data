  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one element, potentially skipping over the next operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator over the other delta, potentially skipping over operations that should be considered in the diff.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the length of the next operation in the other delta, potentially skipping over operations that should be considered in the diff.

DONE.
