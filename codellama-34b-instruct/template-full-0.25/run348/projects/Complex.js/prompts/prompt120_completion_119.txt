  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite, while the new code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite, while the new code checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite, while the new code checks if either `this` is not infinite or `z` is infinite.

DONE.
