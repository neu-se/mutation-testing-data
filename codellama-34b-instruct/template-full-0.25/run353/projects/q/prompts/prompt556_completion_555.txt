  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, errback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callback and errback arguments is reversed, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the errback argument is missing, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, errback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback argument is missing, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
