  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `arguments` would return an object containing all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(0, -1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the last one, whereas `arguments` would return an object containing all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1, -1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first and last ones, whereas `arguments` would return an object containing all the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
