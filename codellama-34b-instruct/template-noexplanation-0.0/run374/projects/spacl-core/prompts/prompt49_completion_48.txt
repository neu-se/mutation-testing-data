  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This change will cause the code to slice the string from the second character instead of the first, which may produce different results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(-1)
```
This change will cause the code to slice the string from the last character instead of the first, which may produce different results in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, -1)
```
This change will cause the code to slice the string from the first character to the last character, which may produce different results in some cases.

DONE.
