  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(θ)` produces a different value than `cos(θ)`, which would affect the subsequent multiplication and division operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a different constant than `θ`, which would affect the calculations involving `cos(θ)` and `rad2deg(θ)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(φ2 + 0.1)
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 0.1 to `φ2` would change the latitude value, which would affect the calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
