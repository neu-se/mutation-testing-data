  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is not a recognized method of the "Q" object, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an array with a single value, rather than an empty array, would cause the "keys" method to return a promise that is immediately resolved with the value "1", rather than a promise that is resolved with the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", ["name"]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an array with a single string value, rather than an empty array, would cause the "keys" method to return a promise that is immediately resolved with the value of the "name" property of the eventually settled object, rather than a promise that is resolved with an array of keys.

DONE.
