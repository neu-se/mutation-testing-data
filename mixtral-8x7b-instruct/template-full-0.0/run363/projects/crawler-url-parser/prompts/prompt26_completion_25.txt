 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
/#.*/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the entire fragment identifier (everything after the '#') instead of just the portion matched by the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
/[?].*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the entire query string (everything after the '?') instead of just the portion matched by the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
/#.*$/, '!'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the matched portion of the fragment identifier with an exclamation mark instead of removing it.

DONE.
