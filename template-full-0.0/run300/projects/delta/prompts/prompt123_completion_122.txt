  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator would allow the loop to continue one extra iteration, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end || iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the loop to continue even if `index` is greater than `end`, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end && !iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would cause the loop to continue even if `iter.hasNext()` is false, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
