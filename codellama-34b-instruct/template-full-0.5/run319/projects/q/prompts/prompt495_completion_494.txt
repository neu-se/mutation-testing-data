  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function is not called in the original code, and it would cause the rejection to be untracked, which would change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejection` function is not called in the original code, and it would cause the rejection to be tracked, which would change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function is not called in the original code, and it would reset the unhandled rejections, which would change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
