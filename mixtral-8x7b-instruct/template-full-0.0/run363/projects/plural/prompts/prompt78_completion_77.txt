 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'goose'.concat('', 'geese')
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of adding the 'geese' string as an argument to the `addRule` function, it concatenates an empty string and the 'geese' string, resulting in the same string 'goosegeese' being passed as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
addRule(null, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing a regular expression as the first argument to the `addRule` function, it passes a null value, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function addRule(match, result) {
  rules.unshift([match, result])
  return 'monkey'
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `addRule` function now returns the string
