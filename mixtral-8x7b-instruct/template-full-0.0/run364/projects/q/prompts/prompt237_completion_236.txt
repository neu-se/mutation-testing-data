 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method would always return `true` instead of the resolved promise or the nearer value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method would return the length of the `messages` array instead of the resolved promise or the nearer value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Date()
