  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is now an empty function that does nothing, which would cause the forEach() method to do nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('Test error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function now throws an error, which would cause the forEach() method to terminate early and not process all the elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(i) => { console.log(this.ops[i]); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function now logs the value of the current array element instead of returning a boolean value, which would cause the forEach() method to log different values and behave differently.

DONE.
