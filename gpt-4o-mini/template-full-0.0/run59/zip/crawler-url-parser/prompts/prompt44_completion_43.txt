Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the parsing behavior to not allow relative URLs when a base URL is provided, potentially leading to incorrect URL resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `URL.parse` function to receive a null value, which could lead to an error or unexpected behavior when trying to resolve the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected boolean value to a number, which may lead to unintended type coercion and affect the URL parsing logic, potentially allowing invalid URLs to be processed.

DONE.
