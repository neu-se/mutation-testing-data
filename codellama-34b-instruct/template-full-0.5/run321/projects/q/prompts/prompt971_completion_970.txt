  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements from the original array except the first, while `args` returns the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the array, while `args` returns the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, while `args` returns the original array.

DONE.
