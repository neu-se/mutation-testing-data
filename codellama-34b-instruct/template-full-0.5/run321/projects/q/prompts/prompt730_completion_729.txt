  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be resolved with a progress notification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, whereas `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be resolved with a progress notification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.progress
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.progress` would cause the promise to be resolved with a progress notification, whereas `deferred.notify` would also cause the promise to be resolved with a progress notification.

DONE.
