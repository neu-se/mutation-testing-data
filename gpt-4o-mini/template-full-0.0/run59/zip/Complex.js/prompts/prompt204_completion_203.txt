Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the exponentiation calculation by adding 1 to the imaginary part, which changes the result of the complex power operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the real part of the base instead of the imaginary part, which fundamentally changes the calculation of the complex power.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the imaginary part to zero, effectively treating the exponent as a purely real number, which can lead to incorrect results for complex exponentiation.

DONE.
