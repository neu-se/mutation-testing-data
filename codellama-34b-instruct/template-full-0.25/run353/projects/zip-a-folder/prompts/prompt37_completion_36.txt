  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, so if the `src` variable is a glob, the function would return `false`, and if it's not a glob, the function would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the expression, so if the `isGlob` function returns `true`, the expression would evaluate to `false`, and if it returns `false`, the expression would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the expression, so if the `isGlob` function returns `true`, the expression would evaluate to `true`, and if it returns `
