  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `args` array to the `messages` array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the first element of the `args` array to the `messages` array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args[1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the second element of the `args` array to the `messages` array, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
