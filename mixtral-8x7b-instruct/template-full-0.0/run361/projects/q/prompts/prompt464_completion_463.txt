 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is not equal to `promise`, and the code checks for array index of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the code checks for array index of `promise`.
