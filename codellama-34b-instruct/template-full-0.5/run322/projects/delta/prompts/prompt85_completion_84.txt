  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different property than `attributes`, and `newOp.insert` may not have the same value as `newOp.attributes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different property than `attributes`, and `newOp.retain` may not have the same value as `newOp.attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different property than `attributes`, and `newOp.delete` may not have the same value as `newOp.attributes`.

DONE.
