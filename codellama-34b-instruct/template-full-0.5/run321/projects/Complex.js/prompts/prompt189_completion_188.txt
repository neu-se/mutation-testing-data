  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block when `a` is not equal to zero, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block when `b` is equal to zero, which is different from the original behavior where the code enters the `if` block when `a` is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block when `a` plus `b` is equal to zero, which is different from the original behavior where the code enters the `if` block when `a` is equal to zero.

DONE.
