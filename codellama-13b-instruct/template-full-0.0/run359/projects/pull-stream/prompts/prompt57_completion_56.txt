  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
item + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used to concatenate the `item` with the number `1`, which would result in a different value being pushed to the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
item - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator is used to subtract the number `1` from the `item`, which would result in a different value being pushed to the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
item * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator is used to multiply the `item` by the number `2`, which would result in a different value being pushed to the array.

DONE.
