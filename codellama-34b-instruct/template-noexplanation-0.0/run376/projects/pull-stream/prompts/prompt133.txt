Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'
//a stream that ends immediately.
module.exports = function empty () {
  return function (abort, cb) {
    <PLACEHOLDER>(true)
  }
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
cb
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
