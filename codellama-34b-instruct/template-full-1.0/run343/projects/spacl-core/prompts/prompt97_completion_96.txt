  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `super.get` refers to the method from the parent class, rather than the method from the same class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid object, and would cause a runtime error if used as a method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` is a method that iterates over an array or object, and would not return the same result as `get`.

DONE.
