  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasOwnProperty(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.hasOwnProperty(index)` checks if the property exists in the object itself, whereas `index in this` checks if the property exists in the object or its prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, index)` checks if the property exists in the object itself, whereas `index in this` checks if the property exists in the object or its prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index in Object.getOwnPropertyNames(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `index in Object.getOwnPropertyNames(this)` checks if the property exists in the object itself, whereas `index in this` checks if the property exists in the object or its prototype chain
