  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the reducer function would be called with null as the second argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the reducer function would be called with a shallow copy of the data array, which may alter the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the reducer function would be called with the first element of the data array, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
