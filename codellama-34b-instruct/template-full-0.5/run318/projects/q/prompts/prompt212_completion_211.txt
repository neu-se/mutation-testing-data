  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for strict equality with the Promise constructor, rather than checking if the value is an instance of the Promise constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the constructor of the value is the Promise constructor, rather than checking if the value is an instance of the Promise constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(value) === Promise.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the prototype of the value is the Promise prototype, rather than checking if the value is an instance of the Promise constructor.

DONE.
