  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This change will cause the function to return `undefined` if `b` is `undefined`, which is different from the original behavior where it would return `b` if `b` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This change will cause the function to return `undefined` if `b` is `null`, which is different from the original behavior where it would return `b` if `b` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This change will cause the function to return `undefined` if `b` is falsy, which is different from the original behavior where it would return `b` if `b` is not an object.

DONE.
