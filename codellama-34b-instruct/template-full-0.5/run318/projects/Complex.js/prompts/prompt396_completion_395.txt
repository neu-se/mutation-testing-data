  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` would return the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `-b` would return the negative value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` would return the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `a-b` would return the difference between `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` would return the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `a+b` would return the sum of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
