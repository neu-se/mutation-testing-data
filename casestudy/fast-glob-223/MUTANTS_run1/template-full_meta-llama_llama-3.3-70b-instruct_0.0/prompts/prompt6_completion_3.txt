Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would receive a lowercase version of the pattern, potentially changing the glob matching behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'!'+pattern
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would receive the negation of the pattern, potentially changing the glob matching behavior to match the opposite of the original pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern, { strict: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would receive a different options object with strict mode enabled, potentially changing the glob matching behavior to be more restrictive.

DONE.
