  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the empty string to replace the last part of the path, while the new code fragment uses a forward slash. This would cause the `pageurl_without_last_part` variable to have a different value, which would affect the outcome of the `gettype` function.
