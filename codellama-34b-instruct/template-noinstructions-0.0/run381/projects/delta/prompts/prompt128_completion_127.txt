  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `start` value to be incremented by 1, which would result in a different value being returned by the `slice` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `start` value to be decremented by 1, which would result in a different value being returned by the `slice` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `start` value to be multiplied by 2, which would result in a different value being returned by the `slice` method.

DONE.
