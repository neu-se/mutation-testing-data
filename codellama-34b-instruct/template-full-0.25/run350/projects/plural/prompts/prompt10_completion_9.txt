  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regular expression match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag is added, which makes the regular expression multi-line, allowing `^` and `$` to match the beginning and end of each line, respectively.

DONE.
