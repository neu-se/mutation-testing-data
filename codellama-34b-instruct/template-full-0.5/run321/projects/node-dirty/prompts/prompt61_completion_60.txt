  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `error` event to be emitted with the provided error, whereas the original code would not emit any error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.on('error', () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `error` event to be ignored, whereas the original code would emit an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `error` event to be emitted with the provided error, whereas the original code would not emit any error.

DONE.
