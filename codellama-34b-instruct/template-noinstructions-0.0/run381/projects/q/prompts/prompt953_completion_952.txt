  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a `fail` method that was not called with the `deferred.reject` argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected even if the `Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs)` method call was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a `fail` method that was not called with the `deferred.resolve` argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved even if the `Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs)` method call was unsuccessful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had
