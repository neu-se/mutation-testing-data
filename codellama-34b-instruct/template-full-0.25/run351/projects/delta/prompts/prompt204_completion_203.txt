  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(thisIter.nextIndex())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing the remaining elements of the `ops` array, instead of the `rest` property which returns the remaining elements as a new Delta object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(thisIter.nextIndex() - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing the remaining elements of the `ops` array, minus the last element, instead of the `rest` property which returns the remaining elements as a new Delta object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(thisIter.nextIndex() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing the remaining elements of the `ops` array, plus one extra element, instead of the `rest` property which returns the remaining elements as a new Delta object
