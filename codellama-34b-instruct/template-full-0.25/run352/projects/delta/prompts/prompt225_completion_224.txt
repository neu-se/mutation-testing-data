  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the strings is reversed, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], cursor + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor position is incremented by 1, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], cursor - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor position is decremented by 1, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce a different result.

DONE.
