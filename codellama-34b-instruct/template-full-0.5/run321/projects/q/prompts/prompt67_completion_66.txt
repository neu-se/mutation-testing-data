  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with an additional argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function would be called with a different delay, which could cause the `flush` function to be called at a different time.

DONE.
