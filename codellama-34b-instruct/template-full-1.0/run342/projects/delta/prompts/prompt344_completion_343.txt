  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior during attribute transformation because the embed type would be replaced with 0, potentially resulting in a different embed type being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior during attribute transformation because the embed type would be incremented by 1, potentially resulting in a different embed type being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior during attribute transformation because the embed type would be decremented by 1, potentially resulting in a different embed type being used.

DONE.
