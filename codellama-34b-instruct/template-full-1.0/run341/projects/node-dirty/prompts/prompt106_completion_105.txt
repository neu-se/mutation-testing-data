  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.get(key)` would return the value stored at `key` in `this._data`, while `row.val` would return the value stored at `key` in `row`. If `row` is a reference to the same object as `this._data`, then the two fragments would have the same behavior. However, if `row` is a different object, then the two fragments would have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `row[key]` would return the value stored at `key` in `row`, while `this._data.get(key)` would return the value stored at `key` in `this._data`. If `row` is a reference to the same object as `this._data`, then the two fragments would have the same behavior. However, if `row` is a different object, then the two fragments would have different behavior
