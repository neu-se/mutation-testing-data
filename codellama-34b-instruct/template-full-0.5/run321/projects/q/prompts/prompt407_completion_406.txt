  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` returns `true` for objects that are promise-like, but not necessarily promises. This could cause the code to behave differently when dealing with non-promise values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of `isPromise`, causing the code to behave differently when dealing with promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `value` is an instance of the `Promise` class, which may not be the same as checking if it is a promise.

DONE.
