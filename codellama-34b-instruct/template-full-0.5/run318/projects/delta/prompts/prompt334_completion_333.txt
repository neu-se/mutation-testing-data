  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.retain` is a different property than `baseOp.attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the original code was.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different property than `baseOp.attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the original code was.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `baseOp.attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the original code was.

DONE.
