  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value of `x` instead of `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value of `y + 1` instead of `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the difference between `x` and `y` instead of `y`.

DONE.
