  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z
```
This would result in different behavior because `z` is a complex number and `a` is not, so the output of the function would change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is incremented by 1, and the output of the function would change accordingly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `a` and `b` would change the output of the function.

DONE.
