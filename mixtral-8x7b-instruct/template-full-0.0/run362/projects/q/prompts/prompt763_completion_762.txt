 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function would always return an empty array, regardless of the input promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function would not wait for the promises to settle before resolving the returned promise, potentially causing it to resolve before all promises have completed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises, Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function would always resolve the returned promise with an array containing a single resolved promise, regardless of the input promises.

DONE.
