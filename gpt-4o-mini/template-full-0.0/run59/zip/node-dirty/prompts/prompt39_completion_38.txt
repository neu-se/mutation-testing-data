Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for inequality with `true`, which would cause the loop to continue for any value that is not strictly `true`, potentially skipping valid entries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(val, key) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the parameters passed to the function `fn`, which may lead to incorrect evaluations if `fn` relies on the specific order of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `fn` with only the `key` argument instead of both `key` and `val`, which may lead to incorrect logic if `fn` is designed to require both parameters for its evaluation.

DONE.
