  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to ignore the case of the input string, so that the pattern would match regardless of whether the input string contains uppercase or lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match the pattern across multiple lines in the input string, rather than just at the beginning of the input string.
