  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', reject);
```
This would result in the `reject` function being called whenever there is an error in the `output` stream, even if the error is not actually related to the `zipArchive` object. This could cause the program to erroneously reject the promise when the `zipArchive` object is not the cause of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', () => reject());
```
This would result in the `reject` function being called whenever there is an error in the `output` stream, but it would be called anonymously, which could make it difficult to determine the cause of the error. Additionally, the `reject` function is being called without any parameters, which could cause issues if the error is being passed to other parts of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEH
