Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be the `targetPath` itself, rather than a modified version of it, potentially leading to incorrect file paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentPath + targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be a concatenation of `currentPath` and `targetPath`, rather than replacing `currentPath` with `targetPath`, potentially leading to incorrect file paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath.replace('$', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would remove all occurrences of '$' from `targetPath`, rather than escaping them, potentially leading to incorrect file paths or security vulnerabilities.

DONE.
