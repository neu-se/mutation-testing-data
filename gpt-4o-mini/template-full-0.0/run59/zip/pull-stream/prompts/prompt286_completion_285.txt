Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `end`, causing the callback to be called with `true` when `end` is `false`, and vice versa, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to the callback instead of the value of `end`, which could lead to confusion about whether the operation was successful or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the first argument to the callback, which is different from passing `end`, and could lead to unexpected results in the callback handling logic.

DONE.
