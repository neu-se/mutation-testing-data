Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"

This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the base URL is present in the URL map, and if so, it deletes it. Replacing the base URL with "http://example.com" would cause the code to delete the "http://example.com" URL from the map, which is not the intended behavior.

This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the base URL is present in the URL map, and if so
