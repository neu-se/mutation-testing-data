  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(1 - minus % 2) * c
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code fragment, if `minus` is odd, the result would be `c` with a minus sign prepended, otherwise it would be `c` without any sign prepended. However, in this alternative, if `minus` is odd, the result would be `-c` regardless of the original sign of `c`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + Math.abs(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code fragment, if `minus` is odd, the result would be `c` with a minus sign prepended, otherwise it would be `c` without any sign prepended. However, in this alternative, if `minus` is odd, the result would be `-|c|` (the absolute value of `c` with a minus sign prepended), and if `minus` is even, the result would be `|c|` (the
