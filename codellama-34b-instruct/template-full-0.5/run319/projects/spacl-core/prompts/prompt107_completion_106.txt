  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the path is equal to the given string, while this modified code fragment checks if the path is equal to the given string plus the string 'foo'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the path is equal to the given string, while this modified code fragment checks if the path is equal to the given string in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the path is equal to the given string, while this modified code fragment checks if the first part of the path is equal to the given string.

DONE.
