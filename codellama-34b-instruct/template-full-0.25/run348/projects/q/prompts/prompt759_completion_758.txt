  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allResolved", "allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `allResolved` would be called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled, "allSettled", "allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `allSettled` would be called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled, "allSettled", "allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `Q.allSettled` would be called with the wrong number of arguments.

DONE.
