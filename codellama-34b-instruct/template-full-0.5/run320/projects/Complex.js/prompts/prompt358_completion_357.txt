  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `a` is not equal to `0`, while the mutated code is checking if `a + 1` is not equal to `0`. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `a` is equal to `-1`, which would result in a different branch of the code being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `a` is not equal to `0`, while the mutated code is checking if `a * 2` is not equal to `0`. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `a` is equal to `0.5`, which would result in a different branch of the code being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in
