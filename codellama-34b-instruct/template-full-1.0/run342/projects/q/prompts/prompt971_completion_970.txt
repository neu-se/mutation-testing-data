  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` expects an array as its second argument, but `null` is not an array and will cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` expects an array with at least one element as its second argument, but `[]` is an empty array which will cause the function to return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` expects an array with at least one element as its second argument, and `[1, 2, 3]` is an array with more than one element which will cause the function to return a new array with the elements of the original array starting from the second argument.

DONE.
