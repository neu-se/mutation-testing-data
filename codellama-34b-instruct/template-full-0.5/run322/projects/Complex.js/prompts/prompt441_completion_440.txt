  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the result to be the negative of the original result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional 1 would cause the result to be 1 greater than the original result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be twice the original result.

DONE.
