  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10-places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the power of `10` and then subtract the result from `places`, rather than calculating `10` raised to the power of `places`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places=10-places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the result of `10-places` to `places`, rather than calculating `10` raised to the power of `places`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(places, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate `places` raised to the power of `10`, rather than calculating `10` raised to the power of `places`.

DONE.
