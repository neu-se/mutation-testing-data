  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is a modulo operator and will return the remainder of the division of the two operands, whereas `!=` is a comparison operator that checks for equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!=` is a comparison operator that checks for inequality, whereas `!==` is a comparison operator that checks for equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `===` is a comparison operator that checks for strict equality, whereas `!==` is a comparison operator that checks for equality.

DONE.
