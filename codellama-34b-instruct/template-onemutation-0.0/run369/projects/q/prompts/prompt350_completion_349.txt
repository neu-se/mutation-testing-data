  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch(function (value) {
    if (done) {
        return;
    }
    done = true;

    deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
}, "when", [function (exception) {
    if (done) {
        return;
    }
    done = true;

    deferred.resolve(_rejected(exception));
}]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method is called with a different callback function, which could potentially cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently.
