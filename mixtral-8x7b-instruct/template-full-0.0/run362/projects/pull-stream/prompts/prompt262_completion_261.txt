 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of propagating the error to the callback, it would assign the error to the `_read` variable, which might cause the function to stop working correctly in subsequent iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not propagate the error to the callback, causing the application to continue executing without notifying about the error, which might lead to unexpected results or further errors down the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an unexpected value (a number) to the callback, which would not be compatible with the error-first callback pattern. This would cause the application to behave unexpectedly, as the callback would not recognize the value as an error.

DONE.
