  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any character, including the forward slash, instead of just the forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any character, including the forward slash, instead of just the forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any character, including the forward slash, instead of just the forward slash.

DONE.
