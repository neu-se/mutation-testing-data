Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of the given path, whereas `path.parse` returns an object containing information about the path, including the root directory. This change would cause the function to incorrectly check if the destination parent is the root directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of the path, whereas `path.parse` returns an object containing information about the path, including the root directory. This change would cause the function to incorrectly check if the destination parent is the root directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => destParent
```
This would result in different behavior because this function would always return the `destParent` path, rather than checking if it is the root directory. This change would cause the function to incorrectly allow the destination parent to be the same as the source parent, potentially leading to infinite recursion.

DONE.
