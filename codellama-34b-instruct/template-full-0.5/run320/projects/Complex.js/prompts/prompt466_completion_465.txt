  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks whether `b` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is not 0, which could lead to unexpected results in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks whether `b` is greater than 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is greater than 0, which could lead to unexpected results in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is equal to
