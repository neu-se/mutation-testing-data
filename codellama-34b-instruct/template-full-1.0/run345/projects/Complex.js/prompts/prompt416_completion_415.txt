  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive result, whereas the original code fragment would return a negative result for negative values of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a negative result, whereas the original code fragment would return a positive result for positive values of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `a`, whereas the original code fragment would square the value of `a`.

DONE.
