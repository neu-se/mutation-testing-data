  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `d` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `d` is greater than 0. This change would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `d` is less than 0. This change would cause the code to
