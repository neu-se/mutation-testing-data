  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function would append "i" to the word, while this new function would append "es" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function would append "i" to the word, while this new function would append "es" and remove the last character of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ii' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function would append "i" to the word, while this new function would append "ii" and remove the last two characters of the word.

DONE.
