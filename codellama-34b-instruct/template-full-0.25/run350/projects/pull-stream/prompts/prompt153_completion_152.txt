  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `!abort` is the negation of that value. If the `abort` value is true, the original code fragment would return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)`, while the modified code fragment would return `abortCb(cb, !abort, onAbort)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `abort + 1` is a numerical value. If the `abort` value is true, the original code fragment would return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)`, while the modified code fragment would return `abortCb(cb, abort + 1, onAbort)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortC
