Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ attributes: { color: 'red' } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a specific attribute for the line, which may affect how the line is processed or rendered, potentially leading to unexpected results in the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ attributes: { fontSize: 12 } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns a font size attribute to the line, which could change the visual representation of the text, leading to inconsistencies in how the text is displayed compared to the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ attributes: { bold: true } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies a bold attribute to the line, which may alter the formatting of the text, potentially causing differences in how the text is perceived or processed in subsequent operations.

DONE.
