  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinφ1` is the sine of the latitude of the first point, while `sinφ2` is the sine of the latitude of the second point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosφ2` is the cosine of the latitude of the second point, while `sinφ2` is the sine of the latitude of the second point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1 + φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(φ1 + φ2)` is the sine of the sum of the latitudes of the two points, while `sinφ2` is the sine of the latitude of the second point.

DONE.
