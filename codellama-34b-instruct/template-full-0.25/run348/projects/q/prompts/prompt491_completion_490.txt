  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with `this` as an argument, which would likely cause an error since `this` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with `promise` as an argument, which would likely cause an error since `promise` is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with `rejection` as an argument, which would likely cause an error since `rejection` is not a promise.

DONE.
