  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This change will cause the loop to run one extra iteration, which may cause the test to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This change will cause the loop to run one fewer iteration, which may also cause the test to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This change will cause the loop to run twice as many iterations, which may cause the test to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

DONE.
