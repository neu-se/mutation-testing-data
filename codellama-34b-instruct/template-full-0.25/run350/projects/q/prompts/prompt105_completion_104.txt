  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `reduce` function to skip every other element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `reduce` function to iterate over the array in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `reduce` function to skip every other element in the array and also cause the `reduce` function to iterate over the array in reverse order.

DONE.
