 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === NaN || z['im'] === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns false, as `NaN` is a special value that is not equal to itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(z['re']) && isFinite(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for finite numbers, which excludes `Infinity` and `-Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof z['re'] === 'number' && typeof z['im'] === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `z['re]` and `z['im']` are of type 'number', but not if they are actual numbers.

DONE.
