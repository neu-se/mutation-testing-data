  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different method than "post" and would likely cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a different method than "post" and would likely cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch"
```
This would result in different behavior because "dispatch" is a different method than "post" and would likely cause the code to fail.

DONE.
