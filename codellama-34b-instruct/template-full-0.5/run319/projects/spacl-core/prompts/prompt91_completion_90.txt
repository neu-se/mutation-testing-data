  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `policies` except the first one, which would cause the `for` loop to skip the first policy and potentially miss some important checks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name !== name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` would return a new array containing only the policies that have a different name than the `name` parameter, which could cause some policies to be skipped if they have the same name as the `name` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` would return a new array containing the policies in reverse order, which could cause some checks to be performed in a different order than expected.

DONE.
