 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns twice the length of the peeked operation, potentially causing incorrect index calculations and unexpected behavior in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the entire `thisIter`, not the length of the peeked operation, causing incorrect index calculations and unexpected behavior in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek('length')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to call the `length` property as a function, causing a TypeError and breaking the execution of the `compose` method.

DONE.
