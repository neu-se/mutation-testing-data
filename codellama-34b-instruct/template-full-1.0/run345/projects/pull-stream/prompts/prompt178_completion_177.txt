  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes three arguments, but the `onAbort` argument is not used in the original code. By replacing `abortCb` with `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)`, the `onAbort` argument is included in the call to `abortCb`, which may cause the behavior of the function to change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(onAbort, cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the call to `abortCb` is changed. In the original code, `abort` is the last argument, but in this modified version, it is the second argument. This may cause the function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
