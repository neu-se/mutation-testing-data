  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.indexOf(linkurl_path) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method checks if the first argument is greater than or equal to 0, while the `includes` method checks if the first argument is strictly equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.lastIndexOf(linkurl_path) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastIndexOf` method checks if the last occurrence of the first argument is equal to 0, while the `includes` method checks if any occurrence of the first argument is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.slice(-linkurl_path.length) === linkurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method extracts a section of the string from the last occurrence of the first argument, while the `includes` method checks if any occurrence
