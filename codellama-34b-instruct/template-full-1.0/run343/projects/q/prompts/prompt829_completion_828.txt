  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onerror` function would be called with the `error` object's `message` property rather than the `error` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onerror` function would be called with a new `Error` object created from the `error` object, rather than the `error` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ message: error.message, name: error.name }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onerror` function would be called with an object containing the `message` and `name` properties of the `error` object, rather than the `error` object itself.

DONE.
