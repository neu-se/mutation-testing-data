Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not exactly equivalent to `null` in JavaScript, and some functions may treat them differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options && options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because if `options` is a falsy value (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `''`, etc.), this expression would evaluate to `false` or the falsy value itself, rather than `null`, potentially causing different behavior in the `JSON.parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options? options.reviver : function(k, v) { return v; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment provides a default reviver function that simply returns the original value, which could lead to different parsing results compared to the original `null` reviver.

DONE.
