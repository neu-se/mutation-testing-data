  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be increased by one millisecond.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be decreased by one millisecond.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be set to zero, causing the promise to be rejected immediately.

DONE.
