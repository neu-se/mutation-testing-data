  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 540
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rad2deg(λ2)` converts the radian value of `λ2` to degrees, while the new code fragment `λ2 + 540` simply adds 540 to the value of `λ2`, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rad2deg(λ2)` converts the radian value of `λ2` to degrees, while the new code fragment `λ2 * 2` multiplies the value of `λ2` by 2, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 - 540
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rad2deg(λ2)` converts the radian value of `λ2` to
