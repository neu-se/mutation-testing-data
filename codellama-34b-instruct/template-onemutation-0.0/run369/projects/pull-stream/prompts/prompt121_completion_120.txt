  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data; sink(source)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `sink` if `acc` is not null, but the new code fragment calls `sink` regardless of the value of `acc`. This could cause the `sink` function to be called with an unexpected argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
