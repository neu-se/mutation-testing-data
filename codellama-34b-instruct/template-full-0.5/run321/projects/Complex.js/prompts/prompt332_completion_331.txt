  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 1, while the new code checks if `b` is not equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 1, while the new code checks if `b` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 1, while the new code checks if `b` is less than 1.

DONE.
