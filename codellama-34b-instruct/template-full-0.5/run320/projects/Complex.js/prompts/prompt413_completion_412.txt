  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` is the square root function, whereas `Math.log` is the natural logarithm function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` is the exponential function, whereas `Math.log` is the natural logarithm function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is the sine function, whereas `Math.log` is the natural logarithm function.

DONE.
