  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the plural form of the word, even if the input number is 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the singular form of the word, even if the input number is 2 or more.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the plural form of the word, even if the input number is 1.

DONE.
