  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` callback would be called with `null` instead of the expected `aborted` error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` callback would be called with the `abort` error instead of the expected `aborted` error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` callback would be called with a new `Error` object instead of the expected `aborted` error.

DONE.
