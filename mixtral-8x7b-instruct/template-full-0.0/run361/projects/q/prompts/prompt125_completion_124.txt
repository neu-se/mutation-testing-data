 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would no longer check if the object has the given key, and instead always return true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` check would always return false, as `null` does not have any own properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the given value is an array, while `object_hasOwnProperty` checks if the given object has the given property as an own property.

DONE.
