  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch(deferred.resolve, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` would be called with the wrong `this` context, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called with the wrong arguments, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called with the wrong arguments, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
