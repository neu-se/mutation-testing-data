  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `stream` variable to `_read` instead of the return value of the `values` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = values(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `values` function with the `stream` variable as an argument, which would return an array of values from the stream, instead of assigning the `stream` variable directly to `_read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = once(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `once` function with the `stream` variable as an argument, which would return a new stream that only emits the first value from the original stream, instead of assigning the `stream` variable directly to `_read`.

DONE.
