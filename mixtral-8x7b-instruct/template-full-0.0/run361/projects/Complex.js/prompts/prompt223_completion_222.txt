 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(Math.abs(a) + Math.abs(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the absolute value of both `a` and `b` before finding the square root, which is different from the original code that calculates the square root of the sum of squares of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a / 2) * Math.exp(1i * b / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses Euler's formula to calculate the square root, which is different from the original code that uses the standard formula for calculating the square root of a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.hypot(a, b) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the hypotenuse of `a` and `b` and
