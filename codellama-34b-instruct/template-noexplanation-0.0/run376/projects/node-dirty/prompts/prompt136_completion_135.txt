  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) + 1}
```
This change will cause the `val` property of the object to be one more than the actual value in the database, which may cause errors in the code that uses the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) - 1}
```
This change will cause the `val` property of the object to be one less than the actual value in the database, which may cause errors in the code that uses the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) * 2}
```
This change will cause the `val` property of the object to be twice the actual value in the database, which may cause errors in the code that uses the object.

DONE.
