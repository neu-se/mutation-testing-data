  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` puts the promise resolution in a setTimeout queue, which would cause a small delay in the resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(Q.reverse)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reverse` flips the resolution and rejection status of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(Q.flip)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.flip` flips the reason for rejection in the case of rejection.

DONE.
