  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not null, and the `makeGenerator` function may rely on the presence of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not undefined, and the `makeGenerator` function may rely on the presence of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not an empty array, and the `makeGenerator` function may rely on the presence of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
