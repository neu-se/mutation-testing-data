Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config, 'extend'
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name being checked is changed from 'extends' to 'extend', potentially causing the function to miss configurations that use the correct property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defaultConfig, 'extends'
```
This would result in different behavior because the object being checked for the 'extends' property is changed from the input 'config' to the 'defaultConfig', potentially causing the function to incorrectly apply extends from the default configuration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config, 'extends' && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` check is replaced with a conditional statement that always evaluates to true, potentially causing the function to always attempt to apply extends, even if the 'extends' property is not present in the configuration.

DONE.
