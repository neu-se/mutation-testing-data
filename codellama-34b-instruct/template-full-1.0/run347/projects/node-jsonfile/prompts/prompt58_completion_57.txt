  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<RI> <chn>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `␍` character as the placeholder, which is a carriage return, while the new code fragment uses the `␤` character, which is a line feed. The effect of this difference would be that the replaced code would produce different outputs for the same input, assuming the input contains newline characters.
