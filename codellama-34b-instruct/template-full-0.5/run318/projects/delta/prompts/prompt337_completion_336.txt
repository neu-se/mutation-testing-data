  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last element of the slice, which may be important for the correctness of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include an extra element in the slice, which may cause the program to access out-of-bounds memory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the slice at the wrong index, which may cause the program to access the wrong data.

DONE.
