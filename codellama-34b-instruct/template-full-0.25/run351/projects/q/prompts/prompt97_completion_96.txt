  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, as the condition would be true for one extra iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, as the condition would be true for one extra iteration.

DONE.
