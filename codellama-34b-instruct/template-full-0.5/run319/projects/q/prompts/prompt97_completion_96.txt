  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in the opposite direction, potentially causing the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate indefinitely, potentially causing the program to crash or behave differently.

DONE.
