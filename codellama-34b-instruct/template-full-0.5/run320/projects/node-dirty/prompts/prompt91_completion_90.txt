  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'drain'` is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas the event `'error'` is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'close'` is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas the event `'error'` is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'end'` is emitted when the write stream has finished writing all the data, whereas the event `'error'` is emitted when an error occurs.

DONE.
