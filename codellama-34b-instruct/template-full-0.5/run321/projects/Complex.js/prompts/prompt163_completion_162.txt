  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + b) / (c + d)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arithmetic mean of the numerator and denominator, rather than the geometric mean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a - b) / (c - d)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arithmetic mean of the numerator and denominator, rather than the geometric mean.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a * b) / (c * d)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of the numerator and denominator, rather than the geometric mean.

DONE.
