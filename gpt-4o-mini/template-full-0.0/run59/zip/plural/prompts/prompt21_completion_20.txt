Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|octopus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds "i" as the plural for "octopus," which should be "octopuses" or "octopi," thus introducing an error in pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w + 's' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the pluralization rule to simply append "s" to the words, which is incorrect for these specific words that should have unique plural forms.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because
