  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key) + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the value to be incremented by 1 before passing it to the `updater` function, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key) - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the value to be decremented by 1 before passing it to the `updater` function, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key) * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the value to be multiplied by 2 before passing it to the `updater` function, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
