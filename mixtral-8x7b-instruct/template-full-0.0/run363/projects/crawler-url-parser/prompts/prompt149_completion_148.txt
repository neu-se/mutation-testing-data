 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl.path.split
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `path` property of the `pageurl` object instead of calling `URL.parse()` on `baseUrlStr`. This change would cause issues if `baseUrlStr` is not a valid URL string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.split("")
