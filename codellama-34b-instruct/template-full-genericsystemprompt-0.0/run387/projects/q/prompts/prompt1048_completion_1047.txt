  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value, whereas `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(error)` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason, whereas `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"))` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason, whereas `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value.

DONE.
