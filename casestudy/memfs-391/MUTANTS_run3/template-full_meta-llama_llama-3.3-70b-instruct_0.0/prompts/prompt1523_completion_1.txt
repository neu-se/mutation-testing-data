Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.root.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to open the root directory instead of the specified filename, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a trailing slash to the filename, which could affect the behavior of the `openSync` method or subsequent file operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pathToFilename(path) + '.tmp'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a temporary file extension to the filename, potentially causing the `openSync` method to fail or behave unexpectedly if the file does not exist or is not accessible.

DONE.
