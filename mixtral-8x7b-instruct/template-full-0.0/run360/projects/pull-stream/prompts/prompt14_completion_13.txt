 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one more time than intended, potentially accessing an undefined array element or causing unexpected side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1 < length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not run for the last element of the arguments array, potentially causing some elements to be skipped and leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not run at all, causing the function to return without processing any of the arguments.

DONE.
