  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and it will not have the same properties and methods as `null`. In the original code, `null` is used as a sentinel value to indicate that there is no data to be read from the stream. If `undefined` is used instead, it could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a boolean value, and it will not have the same properties and methods as `null`. In the original code, `null` is used as a sentinel value to indicate that there is no data to be read from the stream. If `true` is used instead, it could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, and it will not have the same properties and methods
