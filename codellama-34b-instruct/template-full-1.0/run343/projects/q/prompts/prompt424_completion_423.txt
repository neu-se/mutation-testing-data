  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.type === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.state` would always return "pending" for a deferred promise, while `inspected.type` provides more detailed information about the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.state` can return "pending" for a deferred promise, while `inspected.type` provides more detailed information about the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.reason` provides the reason for the promise's rejection, while `inspected.type` provides information about the promise's state.

DONE.
