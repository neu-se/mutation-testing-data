  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `fs.readFile` method directly, bypassing the `universalify` abstraction layer. This could potentially cause issues with the code if the `fs` module is not used correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `fs.readFile` method through the `universalify` abstraction layer, but would not use the `fromCallback` method. This could potentially cause issues with the code if the `fs.readFile` method is not properly implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
await fs.readFile(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `fs.readFile` method directly, without going through the `universalify` abstraction layer.
