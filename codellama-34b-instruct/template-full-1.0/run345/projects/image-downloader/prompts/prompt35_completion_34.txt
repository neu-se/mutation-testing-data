  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.on('data', (data) => {
  writeStream.write(data);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `res.pipe` to pipe the response data directly to the write stream, while this new code fragment uses the `data` event and manually calls `writeStream.write()` to write the data to the stream. This could potentially result in differences in how data is buffered and written to the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
writeStream.write(res.pipe());
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to pipe the response data directly to the write stream using the `pipe()` method, while the original code uses the `res.pipe` property to create a pipe between the response and the write stream. This could potentially result in differences in how data is buffered and written to the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
writeStream.write(res.pipe(createWriteStream(
