  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the computation results in a different value, which could potentially affect the program's control flow or logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the computation results in a different value, which could potentially affect the program's control flow or logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the computation results in a different value, which could potentially affect the program's control flow or logic.

DONE.
