  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `verb` method on the `generator` object, which may have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `verb` method on the `generator` object with the `arg` argument, which may have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg, arg2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `verb` method on the `generator` object with the `arg` and `arg2` arguments, which may have unintended consequences.

DONE.
