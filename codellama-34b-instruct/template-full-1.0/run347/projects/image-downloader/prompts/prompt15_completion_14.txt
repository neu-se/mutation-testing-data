  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns a string representing the last portion of the `pathname`, while `path.join` returns a concatenated string representing the path components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns a string representing the last portion of the `pathname`, while `path.join` returns a concatenated string representing the path components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.sep
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.sep` is a special variable that represents the directory separator for the current operating system, which may not be the same as the separator used in the `pathname`.

DONE.
