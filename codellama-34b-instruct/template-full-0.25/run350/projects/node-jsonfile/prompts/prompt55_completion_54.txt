  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` argument is now incremented by 1, which would change the indentation of the JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` argument is now multiplied by 2, which would change the indentation of the JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` argument is now decremented by 1, which would change the indentation of the JSON string.

DONE.
