  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `var k` is a variable declaration that could be anything.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a numeric value, whereas `var k` could be any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a special value that represents the absence of a value, whereas `var k` could be any value.

DONE.
