Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the fulfillment handler instead of the rejection handler, potentially masking errors that should be handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would effectively ignore the rejection handler, leading to unhandled promise rejections if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Forced rejection"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would forcefully throw an error whenever the promise is rejected, rather than allowing the original rejection reason to propagate, which could lead to loss of context about the original error.

DONE.
