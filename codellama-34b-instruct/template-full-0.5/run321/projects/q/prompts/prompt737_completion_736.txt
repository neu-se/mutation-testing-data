  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a rejected promise, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a promise that is fulfilled with the value of the first promise in the input array, rather than the value of the first fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a promise that is fulfilled with the value of the first promise in the input array, rather than the value of the first fulfilled promise.

DONE.
