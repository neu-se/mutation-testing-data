  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would be called, which would return an object with a `state` property, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which would cause the `reject` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which would cause the `resolve` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
