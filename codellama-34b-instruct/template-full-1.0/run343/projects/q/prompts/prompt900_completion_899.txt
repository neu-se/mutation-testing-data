  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because "foo" is not a function and will cause a type error when `makeNodeResolver` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function, but it is not the same as `makeNodeResolver`, and it will resolve the promise with `undefined` instead of calling the node-style function with the provided arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function, but it is not the same as `makeNodeResolver`, and it will reject the promise with `undefined` instead of calling the node-style function with the provided arguments.

DONE.
