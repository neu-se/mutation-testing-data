[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the third argument of `process.emit("rejectionHandled", ...)` with an empty array, instead of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```javascript
unhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the `unhandledRejections` array, but it would not update the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array. Therefore, the `reportedUnhandledRejections
