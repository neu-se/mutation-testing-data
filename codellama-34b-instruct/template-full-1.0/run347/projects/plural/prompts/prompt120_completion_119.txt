  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the original word, regardless of the number of items, instead of returning the correct plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w * 2; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the original word twice, instead of returning the correct plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the original word plus one, instead of returning the correct plural form.

Conclusion:

DONE.
