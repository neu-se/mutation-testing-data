 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` function would not wait for the specified `ms` milliseconds before checking if the promise has resolved or rejected. Instead, it would immediately check the promise's status, making the timeout feature useless.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ms, null
