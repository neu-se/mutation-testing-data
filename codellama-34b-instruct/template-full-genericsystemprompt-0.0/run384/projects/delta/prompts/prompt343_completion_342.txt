  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).invert(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is not defined for the `Delta` class, and would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).transform(opData, baseOpData, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is not defined for the `Delta` class, and would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).compose(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` method is not defined for the `Delta` class, and would throw a `TypeError` when called.

DONE.
