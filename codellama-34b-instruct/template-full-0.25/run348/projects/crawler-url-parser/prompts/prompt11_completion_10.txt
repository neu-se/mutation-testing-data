  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches URLs that start with "//", while the new code fragment matches URLs that start with "http://" or "https://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\/[^\/]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any URL that starts with "//", while the new code fragment only matches URLs that start with "http://" or "https://" and have at least one character after the protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\/[^\/]+\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any URL that starts with "//", while the new code fragment only matches URLs that start with "http://" or "https://" and have at least one character after the protocol and a trailing slash.

DONE.
