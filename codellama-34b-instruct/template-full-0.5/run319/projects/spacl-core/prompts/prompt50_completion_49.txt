  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` takes two arguments, whereas `slice` takes one or two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of substrings, whereas `slice` returns a substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array of matches, whereas `slice` returns a substring.

DONE.
