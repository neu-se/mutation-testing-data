  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b === 'undefined'` checks whether `b` is undefined, whereas the original code fragment checks whether `b` is not an object. This change would cause the function to return `undefined` for all inputs, regardless of whether they are objects or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === null` checks whether `b` is null, whereas the original code fragment checks whether `b` is not an object. This change would cause the function to return `null` for all inputs, regardless of whether they are objects or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
! Object.keys(b).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `! Object.keys(b).length` checks whether `b` is an empty object, whereas the original code fragment checks whether `b` is not an object. This change would
