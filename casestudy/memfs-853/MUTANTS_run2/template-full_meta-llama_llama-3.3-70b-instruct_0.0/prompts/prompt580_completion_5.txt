Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ENOTDIR, 'open', filename
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of throwing an `EEXIST` error when a file already exists and the `O_EXCL` flag is used, it would throw an `ENOTDIR` error, which is typically used when a file is not a directory, leading to incorrect error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
EPERM, 'open', filename
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of throwing an `EEXIST` error, it would throw an `EPERM` error, which indicates a permission error, potentially masking the actual issue of the file already existing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
EACCES, 'open', filename
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of throwing an `EEXIST` error, it would throw an `EACCES` error, which indicates a permission error, similar to `EPERM`, and would not accurately represent the situation where a file already exists and the `O_EXCL` flag is used.

DONE.
