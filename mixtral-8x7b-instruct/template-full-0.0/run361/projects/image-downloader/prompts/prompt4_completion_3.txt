 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise if `options.dest` is an empty string, while the original code rejects the promise if `options.dest` is not provided at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise if `options.dest` is an array, while the original code rejects the promise if `options.dest` is not provided or is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options.dest === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise if `options.dest` is not defined, while the original code rejects the promise if `options.dest` is not provided or is falsy.

By introducing these changes, we can test the effectiveness of the current test suite in catching potential issues related to the
