  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a function, and the parentheses are necessary to call the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function, and without the parentheses, it would be a reference to the function itself, rather than a call to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that takes a single argument, and passing `null` as the argument would result in a different behavior than passing no argument at all.

DONE.
