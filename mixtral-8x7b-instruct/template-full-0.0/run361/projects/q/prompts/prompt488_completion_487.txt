 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resetUnhandledRejections()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called without passing any arguments, which would immediately reset the unhandled rejections array and stop tracking unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `resetUnhandledRejections` function with an empty function, disabling its functionality. The original code fragment `<PLACEHOLDER>` preserves the function reference, allowing it to be called with the correct behavior.

resetUnhandledRejections = 42
```
This would result
