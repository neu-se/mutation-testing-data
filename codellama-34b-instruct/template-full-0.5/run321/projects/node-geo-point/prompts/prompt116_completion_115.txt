  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDestination` method to be called on the `GeoPoint` class instead of the `calculateDestination` method on the current instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing + 180);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDestination` method to be called with a different bearing value, which would result in a different destination point being calculated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance * 2, bearing);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDestination` method to be called with a different distance value, which would result in a different destination point being calculated.

DONE.
