 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function would return an Op object with the `retain` property set to 0 when the length is 0, instead of using Infinity as in the original code. This could cause issues if the test suite expects Infinity when there is no remaining data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
length > opLength - offset
