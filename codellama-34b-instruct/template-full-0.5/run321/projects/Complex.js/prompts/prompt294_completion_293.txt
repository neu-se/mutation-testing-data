  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to be applied to the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which is not correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to be applied to a different value than the original code, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to be applied to a different value than the original code, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
