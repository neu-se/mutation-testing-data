  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a `null` argument, which would cause the stream to error immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with an `undefined` argument, which would cause the stream to error immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the error message string, which would cause the stream to error immediately.

DONE.
