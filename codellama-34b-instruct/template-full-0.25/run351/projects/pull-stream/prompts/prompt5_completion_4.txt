  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the elements in a different order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the first element removed, which would cause the `for` loop to skip over the first element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.filter(function(through) { return through !== 'through'; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, which would cause the `for` loop to skip over any elements that are not the string `'through'`.

DONE.
