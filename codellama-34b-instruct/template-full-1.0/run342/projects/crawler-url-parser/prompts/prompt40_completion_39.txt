  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null`, even if `baseUrlStr` is not null, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host === baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if `parsedUrl.host` and `baseUrlStr` are different, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host != baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `parsedUrl.host` and `baseUrlStr` are different, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
