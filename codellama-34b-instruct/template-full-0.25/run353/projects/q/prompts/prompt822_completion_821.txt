  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is not called on the promise, which means that the promise is not resolved or rejected, and the callbacks are not called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is called on the promise with `undefined` as the argument, which is not a valid value for the `done` method. This would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is called on the promise with the string "hello" as the argument, which is not a valid value for the `done` method. This would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
