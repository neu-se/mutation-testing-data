  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which returns the first truthy value, while the new code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), which returns the first falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which returns the first truthy value, while the new code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (`!`) and the logical OR operator (`||`), which returns the first falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? abort : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which returns the first truthy value, while the new code fragment uses the ternary operator (`?:`) to return `abort` if `err` is truthy, and `null` otherwise.
