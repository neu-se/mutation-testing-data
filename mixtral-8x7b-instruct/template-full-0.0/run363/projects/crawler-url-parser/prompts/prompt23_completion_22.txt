 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr = baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes everything after the `#` character, while the original code fragment only removes the `#` character itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr = baseUrlStr.replace(/\/?$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes any trailing slash, while the original code fragment does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr = baseUrlStr.replace(/\/?[^\/]*$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last path segment, including any trailing slash, while the original code fragment only removes the `#` character if it exists.

DONE.
