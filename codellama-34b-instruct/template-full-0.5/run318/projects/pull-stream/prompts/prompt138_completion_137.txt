  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the mutated code fragment `!cb` is a negation operator applied to a function call, which would result in a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the mutated code fragment `cb + 1` is an addition operation applied to a function call, which would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the mutated code fragment `cb.toString()` is a method call that converts the function call to a string, which would result in a different value.

DONE.
