  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is Not-a-Number, while `isFinite` checks if a value is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isFinite` checks if a value is not finite, while `isFinite` checks if a value is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['im']) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(this['im'])` returns the absolute value of the imaginary part of the complex number, while `Complex['EPSILON']` is a small positive value used to compare floating-point numbers.

DONE.
