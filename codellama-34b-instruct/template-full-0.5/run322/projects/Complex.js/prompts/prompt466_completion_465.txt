  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `b != 0` would return `true` for any non-zero value of `b`, while `b === 0` would only return `true` for `b` equal to exactly 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `b !== 0` would return `true` for any non-zero value of `b`, while `b === 0` would only return `true` for `b` equal to exactly 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0 && b !== -0
```
This would result in different behavior because `b !== 0 && b !== -0` would return `true` for any non-zero value of `b`, while `b === 0` would only return `true` for `b` equal to exactly 0.

DONE.
