  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is called twice, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is called with the `force` parameter set to `true`, which would force the connection to close immediately, potentially resulting in data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is called with the `force` parameter set to `false`, which would allow the connection to close gracefully, but the `drain` event would not be emitted.

DONE.
