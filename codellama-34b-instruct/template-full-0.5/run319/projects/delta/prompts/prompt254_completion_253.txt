  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by 0 positions, effectively skipping the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by more than one position, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength() - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by less than one position, potentially causing the algorithm to miss important operations.

DONE.
