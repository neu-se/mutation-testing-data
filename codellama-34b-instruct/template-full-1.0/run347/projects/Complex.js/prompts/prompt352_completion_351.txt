  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is calculating the arctangent of the complex number, but `a + b` would calculate the arctangent of the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is a different operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is calculating the arctangent of the complex number, but `a - b` would calculate the arctangent of the difference of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is a different operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is calculating the arctangent of the complex number, but `a * b` would calculate the arctangent of the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is a different operation.

DONE.
