  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to be called with the `undefined` value, which would delete the key from the map instead of updating it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to be called instead of the `set` method, which could lead to a different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to be called on the `_data` property instead of the `this` object, which could lead to a different behavior in the program.

DONE.
