  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `0` instead of the cosine of the angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sine of the angle instead of the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the tangent of the angle instead of the cosine.

DONE.
