  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is used to propagate an error, while the new code fragment `null` would not propagate any error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is used to propagate an error, while the new code fragment `undefined` would not propagate any error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is used to propagate an error, while the new code fragment `new Error()` would create a new error object and propagate it.

DONE.
