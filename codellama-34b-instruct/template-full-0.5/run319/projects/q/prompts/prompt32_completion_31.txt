  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, whereas `runSingle` is a function that runs a single task in the async queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that flushes the async queue, whereas `runSingle` is a function that runs a single task in the async queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push(task)
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.push(task)` would push the task onto the `laterQueue` instead of running it immediately, whereas `runSingle` runs the task immediately.

DONE.
