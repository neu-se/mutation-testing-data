  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify({key: 'foo', val: 'bar'})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same string, regardless of the input object, whereas the original code fragment would return a different string for different input objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify({key: 'foo', val: 'baz'})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same string, regardless of the input object, whereas the original code fragment would return a different string for different input objects.
