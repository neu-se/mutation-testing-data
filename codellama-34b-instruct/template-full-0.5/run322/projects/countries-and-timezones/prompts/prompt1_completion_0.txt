  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzMap
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null if the `tzMap` object is empty, but the original code fragment only returns null if the `name` variable is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzMap.current
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null if the `current` property of the `tzMap` object is empty, but the original code fragment only returns null if the `name` variable is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzMap.all
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null if the `all` property of the `tzMap` object is empty, but the original code fragment only returns null if the `name` variable is falsy.

DONE.
