  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the current `this` object instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the first argument passed to it instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a random number instead of the expected value.

DONE.
