  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `abort`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `abort`.

DONE.
