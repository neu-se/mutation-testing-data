  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` could be a truthy value that is not a number, while `typeof op.delete === 'number'` would only detect numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` could be a negative number, while `op.delete > 0` would only detect positive numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isNaN(op.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof op.delete === 'number'` would not detect `NaN`, while `!Number.isNaN(op.delete)` would detect `NaN` as a number.

DONE.
