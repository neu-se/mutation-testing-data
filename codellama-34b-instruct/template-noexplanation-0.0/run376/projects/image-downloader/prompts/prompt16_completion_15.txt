  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/^.*\//, '')
```
This code fragment will remove any leading path segments from the `options.dest` string, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This code fragment will split the `options.dest` string into an array of path segments and return the last segment, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This code fragment will remove all forward slashes from the `options.dest` string, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
