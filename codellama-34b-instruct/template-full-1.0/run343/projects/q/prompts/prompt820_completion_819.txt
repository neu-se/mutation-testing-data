  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the `rejected` function to be called with the `fulfilled` argument and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid callback function, causing an error to be thrown when `done` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid callback function, causing an error to be thrown when `done` is called.

DONE.
