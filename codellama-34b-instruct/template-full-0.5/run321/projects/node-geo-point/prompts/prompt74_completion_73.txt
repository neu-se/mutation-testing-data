  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `rad2deg(θ)` to convert the bearing from radians to degrees, but adding 360 degrees would result in a value that is always greater than 360 degrees, which is not a valid bearing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `rad2deg(θ)` to convert the bearing from radians to degrees, but multiplying θ by 180 and dividing by pi would result in a value that is not a valid bearing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 2 * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `rad2deg(θ)` to convert the bearing from radians to degrees, but adding 2π to
