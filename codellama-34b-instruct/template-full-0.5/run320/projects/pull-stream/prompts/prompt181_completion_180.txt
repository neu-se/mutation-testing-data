  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` function immediately, instead of passing it as an argument to `abortCb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `onAbort` function, which is not a valid operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the `onAbort` argument to `abortCb`, which is not the same as passing the `onAbort` function.

DONE.
