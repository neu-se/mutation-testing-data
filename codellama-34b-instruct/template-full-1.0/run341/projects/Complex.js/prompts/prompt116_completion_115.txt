  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would flip the truthyness of the operand `b`, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would flip the truthyness of the operand `b`, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from `b`, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

DONE.
