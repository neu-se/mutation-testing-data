  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event would be emitted with an incorrect size value, which could cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event would be emitted with a size value that is too small, which could cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size / 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event would be emitted with a size value that is half the actual size, which could cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
