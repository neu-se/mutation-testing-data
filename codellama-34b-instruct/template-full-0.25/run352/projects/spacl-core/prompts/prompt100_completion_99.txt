  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `path` string to uppercase, which could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the `path` string, which could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy is based on the length of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `path` string into an array of substrings using `/` as the delimiter, and then return the first element of the array. This could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy is based on the first element of the path.

DONE.
