 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"GET", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison for the `op` parameter would fail, causing the `dispatch` method to not execute the expected code path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"get", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter would be an empty array instead of containing the `key` value, causing the `get` method to not function as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"get", {key: 'value'}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter would be an object instead of containing the `key` value, causing the `get` method to not function as intended.

DONE.
