  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array, while `array_slice.bind(null)` returns a new function that, when called, will return a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array, while `array_slice.bind(this)` returns a new function that, when called, will return a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array, using the `this` value of the function as the `this` value of the new function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(void 0)
```
This would result in
