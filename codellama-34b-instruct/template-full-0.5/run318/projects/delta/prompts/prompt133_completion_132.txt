  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be increased by 1, which could cause the operation to be applied to the wrong part of the document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be decreased by 1, which could cause the operation to be applied to the wrong part of the document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be doubled, which could cause the operation to be applied to the wrong part of the document.

DONE.
