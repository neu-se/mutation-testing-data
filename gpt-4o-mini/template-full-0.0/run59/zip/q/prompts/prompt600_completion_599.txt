Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, op
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the parameters is reversed, which may lead to incorrect handling of the operation and its arguments, potentially causing runtime errors or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because wrapping `args` in an array changes the structure of the arguments being passed, which could lead to the operation not receiving the expected parameters and failing to execute correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the second argument means that the operation will not receive any arguments, which could cause the operation to fail or behave incorrectly due to missing expected input.

DONE.
