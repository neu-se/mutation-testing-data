  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')\\b', 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `s` at the end of the regular expression is removed, causing the regular expression to match words that are not plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')\\b', 'g')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, causing the regular expression to match all occurrences of the words, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')\\b', 'i')
```
