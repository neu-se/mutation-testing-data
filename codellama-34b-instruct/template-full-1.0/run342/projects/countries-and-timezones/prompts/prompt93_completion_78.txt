  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is being explicitly set to `false`, which could cause the function to return a different result than it would if the original code fragment was used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.someOtherProperty = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because a different property is being set to a different value, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is being set to its opposite value, which could cause the function to return a different result than it would if the original code fragment was used.

DONE.
