  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to `null` instead of the `policy` object, which could cause unexpected behavior when trying to access the policy later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to `undefined` instead of the `policy` object, which could cause unexpected behavior when trying to access the policy later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, "policy"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to the string "policy" instead of the `policy` object, which could cause unexpected behavior when trying to access the policy later.

DONE.
