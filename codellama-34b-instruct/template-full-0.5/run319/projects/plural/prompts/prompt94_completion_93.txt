  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applied the rule to words that start with "wo", while this new code fragment applies it to all words that end with "man".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'o') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaced "a" with "e", while this new code fragment replaces "a" with "o".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'i') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaced "a" with "e", while this new code fragment replaces "a"
