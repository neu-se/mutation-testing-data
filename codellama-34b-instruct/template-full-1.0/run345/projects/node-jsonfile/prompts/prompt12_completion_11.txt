  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : options.replacer
```
This would result in different behavior because if `options` is not defined, the original code would return `null`, while this modified code would return `options.replacer`, which may be undefined or have a different value than the original code expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : 42
```
This would result in different behavior because if `options` is not defined, the original code would return `null`, while this modified code would return `42`, which is a different value than the original code expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : options.split('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because if `options` is not defined, the original code would return `null`, while this modified code would return an array of strings splitting the `options` value on the newline character, which may be different from
