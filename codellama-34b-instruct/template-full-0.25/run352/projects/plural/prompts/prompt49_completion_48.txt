  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-sensitive, so it would not match words like "dwarf" or "roof" that were previously matched.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-insensitive, so it would match words like "dwarf" or "roof" that were previously not matched.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-sensitive and matches words that end with "ies"
