  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promises).allSettled(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` method would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promises).allSettled(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` method would be called with the `promises` array as an argument, which is not the correct usage of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promises).allSettled(Q.all(promises));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` method would be called with the result of `Q.all(promises)`, which is a promise that resolves to an array of promises, rather than the array of promises itself.

DONE.
