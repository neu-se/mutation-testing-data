  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks for the `NaN` value, while `isFinite` checks for any finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isNaN` checks for any non-`NaN` value, while `isNaN` checks for the `NaN` value specifically.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks for the `Infinity` value, while `isNaN` checks for the `NaN` value.

DONE.
