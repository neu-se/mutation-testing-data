  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').reverse().slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would cause the resulting array to be in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array would not include the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array would only include the last element.

DONE.
