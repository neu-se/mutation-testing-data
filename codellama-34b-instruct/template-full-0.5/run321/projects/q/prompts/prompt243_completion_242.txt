  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would always return `false` if `resolvedPromise` is not `undefined`, even if it is `null` or `false`, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would always return `true` if `resolvedPromise` is not `undefined`, even if it is `null` or `false`, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would always return `false` if `resolvedPromise` is not `null`, even if it is `undefined` or `false`, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected incorrectly.
