  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string representation of the object instead of a boolean value, which would cause the if statement to always evaluate to true and skip the else clause.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the boolean value returned by `object.inspect()`, causing the if statement to always evaluate to false and skip the if clause.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the string representation of the object returned by `object.inspect()`, which would cause the if statement to evaluate to either 0 or 1, instead of a boolean value.

DONE.
