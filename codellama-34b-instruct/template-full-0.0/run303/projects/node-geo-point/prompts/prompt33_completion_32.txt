  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the second point instead of the first point, which could lead to a different calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the first point instead of the longitude, which could lead to a different calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the second point instead of the longitude, which could lead to a different calculation of the distance between the two points.

DONE.
