  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && !Array.isArray(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` is an object, but this new code fragment also checks if `object` is not an array. This would cause the `fromObject` method to throw a `TypeError` if `object` is an array, even if it has the required properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && !object.hasOwnProperty('latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` has the `latitude` property, but this new code fragment also checks if `object` does not have the `latitude` property. This would cause the `fromObject` method to throw a `TypeError` if `object` does not have the `latitude` property, even if it has the required properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && !object.hasOwn
