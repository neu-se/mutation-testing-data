  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1;
```
This would result in an infinite loop because `parser_exit()` is never called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;
```
This would result in an infinite loop because `parser_exit()` is never called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in an infinite loop because `parser_exit()` is never called.

DONE.
