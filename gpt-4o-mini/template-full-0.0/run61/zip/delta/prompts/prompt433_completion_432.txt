Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the length of the operation is calculated, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations that do not have an `attributes` property, which could cause the `next` method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it artificially increases the length by 1, which could cause the `next` method to skip operations or incorrectly calculate the remaining length, leading to incorrect results when retrieving the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the length to 0, which would cause the `next` method to always return an empty operation, effectively breaking the iteration logic and preventing any meaningful operations from being processed.

DONE.
