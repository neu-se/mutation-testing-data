  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, but this replacement would make `a` null, which is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, but this replacement would make `a` undefined, which is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, but this replacement would make `a` an empty object, which is an object.

DONE.
