  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attempt1` array has at least two elements, while this code fragment checks if the second element of the `attempt1` array is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attempt1` array has at least two elements, while this code fragment checks if the second element of the `attempt1` array is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] !== ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attempt1` array has at least two elements, while this code fragment checks if the second element of the `attempt1` array is not an empty string.

DONE.
