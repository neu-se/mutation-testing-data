  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\b(?:goggle|scissor|plier|tong|tweezer|trouser|pant|pantie|clothe|billiard|bowl|card|dart|skittle|draught|kudo|premise|shamble|glasse|spectacle|jitter|alm|fece|bowel|sud|entrail|electronic|outskirt|odd|tropic|riche|surrounding|thank|heroic|remain|amend|\w+)\b$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different set of words, as the original regex uses a negative lookahead assertion to exclude words that end in "s" but are not in the `clothes` list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(?:trousers?|pants?|pant(?:ies|is)|cloth(?:es|e)|b
