Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always retrieves the next operation with a fixed length of 1, potentially skipping over larger operations that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively retrieves no operations (since the length is zero), which could lead to an empty `ops` array being returned when it should contain valid operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to retrieve a negative number of operations, which is nonsensical and could lead to unexpected results or errors in the processing logic.

DONE.
