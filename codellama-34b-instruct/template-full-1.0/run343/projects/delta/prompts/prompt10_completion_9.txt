  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a || b` will always evaluate to `a` if `a` is truthy, whereas the original code `a` will always evaluate to `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a && b` will always evaluate to `b` if `a` is falsy, whereas the original code `a` will always evaluate to `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a
```
This would result in different behavior because `!a` will always evaluate to `false` if `a` is truthy, whereas the original code `a` will always evaluate to `a`.

DONE.
