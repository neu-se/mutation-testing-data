Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ops === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any object (including non-array objects) to pass the check, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when the `ops` parameter is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `ops` is not null or undefined, allowing any other falsy value (like an empty string or zero) to pass the check, which could lead to incorrect initialization of `this.ops`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops` is an instance of an array, which may not work correctly in cases where the code is executed in different contexts (like iframes) where the Array constructor is different, leading to potential failures in recognizing valid arrays.

DONE.
