  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by 0 elements, which would not have any effect on the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by 1 element, which would change the order of the elements in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by 2 elements, which would change the order of the elements in the iteration and potentially cause the iterator to skip over some elements.

DONE.
