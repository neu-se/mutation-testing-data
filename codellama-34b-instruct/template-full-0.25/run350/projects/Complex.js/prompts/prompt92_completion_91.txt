  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant value is different. Instead of adding 1, it would add 0, which would not change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant value is different. Instead of adding 1, it would add 2, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant value is a string, which would cause a type error when trying to perform arithmetic operations.

DONE.
