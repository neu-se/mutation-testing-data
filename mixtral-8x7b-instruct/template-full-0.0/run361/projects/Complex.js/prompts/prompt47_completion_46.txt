 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'abs' of a && 'arg' of a
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `of` operator instead of `in`, which would always return `false` as `a` is not an iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'length' in a && a[0] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` has a `length` property and its first element is not `undefined`, instead of checking if `'abs'` and `'arg'` properties are present in `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'toString' in a && a.toString().includes('abs') && a.toString().includes('arg')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` has a `toString` method and its string representation includes both `'abs'` and `'arg'` strings, instead of checking if `
