  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator, which inverts the truthiness of the expression. In this case, it would invert the result of the `isEqual` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the two objects are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of the `isEqual` function, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the two objects are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the result of the `isEqual` function by 0, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the two objects are
