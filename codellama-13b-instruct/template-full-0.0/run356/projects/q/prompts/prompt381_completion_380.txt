```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise itself, while the modified code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the original promise's fulfillment value, but wrapped in a Q promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) { return Q.resolve(value); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise itself, while the modified code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the original promise's fulfillment value, but wrapped in a Q promise and resolved using the
