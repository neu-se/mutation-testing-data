  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die' !== 'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is now checking for inequality instead of testing if the input argument is a specific string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dicee"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is now testing for the presence of the string "dicee" instead of "dice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dies"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is now testing for the presence of the string "dies" instead of "dice".

DONE.
