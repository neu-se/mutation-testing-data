Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split(",")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delimiter used for splitting the `pageurl_path`, which would lead to an incorrect number of parts being counted and potentially misclassifying the URL type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").map(part => part.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms each part of the `pageurl_path` to uppercase, which would affect the comparison logic later in the function, potentially leading to incorrect type classifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(part => part.length < 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out parts of the `pageurl_path` that are less than 3 characters long, which could lead to an incomplete or incorrect representation of the URL structure, affecting the logic that determines the URL type.

DONE.
