This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `trim` method on the text of the anchor element, which would remove any whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the text. In this alternative, the `trim` method is not called, so any whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the text would be included in the `text` property.

In this alternative, the `toUpperCase` method is called on the text, which would convert all the characters in the text to uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().split(" ").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
