  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value stored at the specified key in the database, rather than the entire Map object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key).val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value stored at the specified key in the database, rather than the entire Map object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key).val.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value stored at the specified key in the database, converted to a string, rather than the entire Map object.

DONE.
