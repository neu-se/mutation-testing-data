  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reference to the `zoom` function, while this new code fragment returns a reference to a new, empty function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reference to the `zoom` function, while this new code fragment returns the numeric value `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{x: zoom, y: zoom}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reference to the `zoom` function, while this new code fragment returns a new object with two properties, `x` and `y`, both set to the `zoom` value.

DONE.
