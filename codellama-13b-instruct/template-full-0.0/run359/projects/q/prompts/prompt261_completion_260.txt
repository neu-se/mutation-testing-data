  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method is called on the resolved promise, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the `promiseDispatch` method, rather than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method is called on the resolved promise, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the `valueOf` method, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is called on the resolved promise, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the `inspect` method, rather than the original value.

DONE.
