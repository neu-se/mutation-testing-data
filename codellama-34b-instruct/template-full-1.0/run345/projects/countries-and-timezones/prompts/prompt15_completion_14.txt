  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if `tz.r` is `undefined`, the expression would evaluate to `false`. In contrast, the original code fragment used the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not the same as `undefined`. The `!==` operator would evaluate to `true` if `tz.r` is `null`, but the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` if `tz.r` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cleanTimezoneMap(tz)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cleanTimezoneMap` is not a function in the provided code snippet, so the code would crash if this line is reached. The original code fragment does not call
