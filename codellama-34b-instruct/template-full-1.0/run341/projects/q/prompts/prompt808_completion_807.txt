  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with `null` instead of the expected `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with an error instead of being fulfilled with `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(function() { return null; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with `null` instead of with `object`.

DONE.
