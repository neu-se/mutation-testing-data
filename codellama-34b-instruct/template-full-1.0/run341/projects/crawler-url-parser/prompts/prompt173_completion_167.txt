  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn
```
This would result in different behavior because the warning message would be logged to the console instead of the log.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be logged to the console instead of the log.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info
```
This would result in different behavior because the informational message would be logged to the console instead of the log.

DONE.
