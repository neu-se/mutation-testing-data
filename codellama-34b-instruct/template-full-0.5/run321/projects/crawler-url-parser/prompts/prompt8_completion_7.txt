  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `null` for any input, regardless of whether the input contains illegal characters or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `true` for any input, regardless of whether the input contains illegal characters or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.includes("illegal")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `true` if the input contains the string "illegal", regardless of whether the input contains any other illegal characters or not.

DONE.
