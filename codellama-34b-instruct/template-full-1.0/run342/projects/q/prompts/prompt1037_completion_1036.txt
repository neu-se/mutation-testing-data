  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is not resolved, causing the "get" method to hang indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(Q.reject("error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is rejected, causing the "get" method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(new Error("error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object that is not a promise, causing the "get" method to throw an error.

DONE.
