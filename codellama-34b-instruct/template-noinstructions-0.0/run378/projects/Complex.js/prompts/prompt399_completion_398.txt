  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the arccosine of the complex number, which is not the same as the original code that returned the arctangent of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asin']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the arcsine of the complex number, which is not the same as the original code that returned the arctangent of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['atan']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the arctangent of the complex number, which is the same as the original code.

DONE.
