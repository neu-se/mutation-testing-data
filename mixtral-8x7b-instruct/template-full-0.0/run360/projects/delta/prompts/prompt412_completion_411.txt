 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition checks if the index is less than or equal to the end index, and this change would cause the loop to exit prematurely, skipping some operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index - length
