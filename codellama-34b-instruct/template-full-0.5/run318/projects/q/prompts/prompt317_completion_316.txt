  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with a null prototype, which would not have the same properties and methods as the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(Object.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the Object.prototype as its prototype, which would have different properties and methods than the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with an empty prototype, which would not have the same properties and methods as the original object.

DONE.
