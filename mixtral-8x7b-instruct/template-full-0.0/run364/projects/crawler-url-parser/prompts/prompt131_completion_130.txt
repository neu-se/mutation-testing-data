 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/default\.[a-z]+$/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the literal string '/default.[a-z]+$' instead of using a regular expression to match the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new RegExp('/default\\.[a-z]+$/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new regular expression object with the specified pattern, but it would not have the global flag (g) which could lead to different matching behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl_path.match(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first match of the regular expression instead of replacing it with an empty string.

DONE.
