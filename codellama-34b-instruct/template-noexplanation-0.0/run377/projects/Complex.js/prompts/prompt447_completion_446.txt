  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This change will cause the `round` method to use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which will result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places + this['im']
```
This change will cause the `round` method to use the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which will result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places - this['im']
```
This change will cause the `round` method to use the difference of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which will result in a different output.

DONE.
