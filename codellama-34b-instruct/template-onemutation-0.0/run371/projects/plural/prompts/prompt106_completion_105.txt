  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "man" or "woman" with an optional "w" at the beginning, while the new code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "man" or "woman" with an optional "w" at the beginning and replaces the "a" with "e".

DONE.
