  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, making the condition equivalent to `if (1) { ... }`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false, making the condition equivalent to `if (0) { ... }`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a > 0 ? a : -a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the absolute value of `a` before comparing it to `b`, potentially changing the outcome of the comparison.

DONE.
