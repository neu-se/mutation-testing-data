  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array, and checking its length to see if it is equal to 0 would not have the same effect as checking if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args !== null && args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `args` is not null and then check if its length is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof args !== 'undefined' && args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `args` is defined and then check if its length is equal to 0.

DONE.
