  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, which could cause the code to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, which could cause the code to fail or produce unexpected results. Additionally, the replacement string is different from the original code, which could also cause different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, which could cause the code to fail or produce unexpected results. Additionally, the replacement string is different from the original code, which could also cause
