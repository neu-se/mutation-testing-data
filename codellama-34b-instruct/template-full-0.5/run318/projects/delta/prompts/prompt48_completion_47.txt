  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is missing, which would cause the condition to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `embedType` is the same as the first key of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the key being checked is changed from 0 to 1, which would cause the condition to evaluate to `true` if the `embedType` is the same as the second key of `b`, instead of the first key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).includes(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method is used instead of checking the first key of `b`, which would cause the condition to evaluate to `true` if `embedType` is included in the keys of `
