  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only throws the reason if the callback is not a function, while this code throws the reason regardless of whether the callback is a function or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return Q.reject(reason);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only throws the reason if the callback is not a function, while this code rejects the promise with the reason regardless of whether the callback is a function or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return Q.resolve(reason);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only throws the reason if the callback is not a function, while this code resolves the promise with the reason regardless of whether the callback is a function
