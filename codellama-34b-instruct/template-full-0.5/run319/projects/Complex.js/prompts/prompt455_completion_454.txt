  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `this['isNaN']`, causing the `toString` method to return `'NaN'` even if the complex number is not NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isFinite']` would check if the complex number is finite, but the `toString` method would still return `'NaN'` if the complex number is NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re'] !== this['re']` would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `toString` method to return `'NaN'` even if the complex number is not NaN.

DONE.
