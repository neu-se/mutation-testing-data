Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly match URLs ending with "index" instead of "default", potentially allowing URLs that should be filtered out to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[a-z]+\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any URL that ends with a pattern of a word followed by a dot and a word, which is much broader than the original intent of matching only "default" files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[0-9]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match URLs that end with "default" followed by a numeric extension, excluding valid "default" files with alphabetic extensions, thus changing the filtering criteria.

DONE.
