  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp + 1
```
This change will cause the `atanh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp - 1
```
This change will also cause the `atanh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp * 2
```
This change will cause the `atanh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
