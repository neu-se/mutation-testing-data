  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `Buffer.isBuffer` check, potentially causing the `content` variable to be treated as a string instead of a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `isBuffer` method on the `Buffer` object, which would return a different result than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content instanceof Buffer
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `content` variable is an instance of the `Buffer` class, which would return a different result than the original code.

DONE.
