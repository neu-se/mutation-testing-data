  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'](-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the arc cosine of the complex number, while this replacement calculates the arc cosine of -1, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'](-this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the arc cosine of the complex number, while this replacement calculates the arc cosine of the negative of the complex number, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'](this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the arc cosine of the complex number, while this replacement calculates the arc cosine of the imaginary part of the complex number, which is a different value.

DONE.
