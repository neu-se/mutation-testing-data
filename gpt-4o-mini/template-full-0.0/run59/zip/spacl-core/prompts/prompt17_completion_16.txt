Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = <PLACEHOLDER>(spec.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the input `spec` to lowercase, potentially changing the regex pattern generated for paths that are case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec + '/extra')
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an extra segment to the `spec`, which could alter the resulting regex and lead to incorrect path matching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec.replace(/:/g, ';'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all colons in the `spec` with semicolons, which would change the way captures are defined in the regex, potentially leading to malformed paths.

DONE.
