  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the property of the object instead of the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the key instead of accessing the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the key to uppercase instead of accessing the property.

DONE.
