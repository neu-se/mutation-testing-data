  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the text content of the current element, while the modified code fragment returns the text content of the current element and all its descendants.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the href attribute of the current element, while the modified code fragment returns the value of the href attribute of the current element and all its descendants.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the HTML content of the current element, while the modified code fragment returns the HTML content of the current element and all its descendants.

DONE.
