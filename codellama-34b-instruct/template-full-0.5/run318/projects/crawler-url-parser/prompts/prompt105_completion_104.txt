  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the text would be returned instead of the text itself, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the text would be returned in uppercase instead of its original case, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the text would be returned in reverse order instead of its original order, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

DONE.
