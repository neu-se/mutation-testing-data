Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the bearing angle would alter the calculated destination point, potentially leading to an incorrect location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying the bearing angle by 2 would change the direction of the destination point, resulting in a point that is twice as far off from the intended bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because setting the bearing angle to 0 would always calculate the destination point directly north of the original point, ignoring the intended bearing value.

DONE.
