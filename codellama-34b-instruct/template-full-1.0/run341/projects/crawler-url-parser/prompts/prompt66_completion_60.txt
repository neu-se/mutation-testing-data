  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split('=')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the search string into an array of key-value pairs, whereas the original code would have returned the number of occurrences of the search string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the search string, whereas the original code would have returned the number of occurrences of the search string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/(&|\+)/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the search string into an array of key-value pairs, whereas the original code would have returned the number of occurrences of the search string.

DONE.
