  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is a different object than `Promise.prototype`, and would likely cause errors when attempting to access or manipulate the properties of a promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and would likely cause errors when attempting to access or manipulate the properties of a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "Not a Number", and would likely cause errors when attempting to access or manipulate the properties of a promise object.

DONE.
