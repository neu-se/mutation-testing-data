  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, as `resolvedPromise` is a promise object and not a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, as the `isFulfilled()` method is not defined on the `resolvedPromise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.isRejected()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, as the `isRejected()` method is not defined on the `resolvedPromise` object.

DONE.
