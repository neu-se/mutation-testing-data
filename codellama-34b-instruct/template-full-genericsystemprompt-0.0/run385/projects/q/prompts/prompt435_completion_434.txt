  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process !== "object" || typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `if` statement to be executed even if `process` is not an object or if `process.emit` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process !== "object" && typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require `process` to be an object and `process.emit` to be a function in order for the `if` statement to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process === "object" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require `process` to be an object and `process.emit` to be a function in order for the `if` statement to be executed.

DONE.
