  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter is not passed to the `parse` function, which would cause the `baseUrlStr` variable to be undefined, leading to different behavior in the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter is not passed to the `parse` function, which would cause the `baseUrlStr` variable to be undefined, leading to different behavior in the `parse` function.
