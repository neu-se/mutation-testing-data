 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearerValue` variable would be assigned `null` instead of the `resolvedPromise` if the `value` is not a promise. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors downstream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because a new, unresolved promise would be assigned to `nearerValue` instead of the `resolvedPromise` if the `value` is not a promise. This could lead to the promise never being resolved or rejected, causing the code to hang or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because a new, resolved promise would be assigned to `nearerValue` instead of the `resolvedPromise` if the `value` is not a promise. This could lead to the promise being resolved prematurely, causing
