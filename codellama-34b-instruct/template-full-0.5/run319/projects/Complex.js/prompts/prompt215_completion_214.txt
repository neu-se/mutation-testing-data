  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of `a` and `b`, rather than their product.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference of `a` and `b`, rather than their product.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of `a` and `b`, which is the original behavior of the code fragment.

DONE.
