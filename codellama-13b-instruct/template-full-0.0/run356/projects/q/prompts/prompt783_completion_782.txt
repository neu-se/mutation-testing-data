  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, progress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progress` callback to be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises, whereas the original code only called it for fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(fulfilled, void 0, progress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progress` callback to be called only for fulfilled promises, whereas the original code called it for both fulfilled and rejected promises.
