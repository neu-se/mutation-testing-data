  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pop the last `Op` from the `ops` array, rather than removing the last `Op` that has a retain attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pop the last `Op` from the `ops` array, rather than removing the last `Op` that has a retain attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pop the last `Op` from the `ops` array, rather than removing the last `Op` that has a retain attribute.

DONE.
