  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty(Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a new property `__esModule` on the `Complex` object, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['__esModule'] = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `__esModule` property on the `Complex` object to `true`, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['__esModule'] = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `__esModule` property on the `Complex` object to `false`, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
