  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let pageurl = typeof pageurl;
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of a variable, while `pageurl` is an object. This code would always result in `pageurl` being assigned the string value `"object"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let pageurl = pageurl.valueOf();
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf()` is a method that returns the primitive value of an object, while `pageurl` is an object. This code would always result in `pageurl` being assigned a string containing the primitive value of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let pageurl = pageurl.toString();
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` is a method that returns a string representing the object, while `pageurl` is an object. This code would always result in `pageurl` being assigned a string representing the object.
