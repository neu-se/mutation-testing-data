  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is a different calculation than `a, b`, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is a different calculation than `a, b`, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a / b` is a different calculation than `a, b`, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
