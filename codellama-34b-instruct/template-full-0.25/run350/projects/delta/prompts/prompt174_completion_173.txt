  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, but the `- 1` would cause the length to be reduced by 1, which could result in a different operation being selected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, but the `+ 1` would cause the length to be increased by 1, which could result in a different operation being selected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.max()` function would select the larger of the two lengths, which could result in a different operation being selected.

DONE.
