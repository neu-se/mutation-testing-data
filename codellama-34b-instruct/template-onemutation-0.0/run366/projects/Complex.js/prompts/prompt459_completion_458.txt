  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this['im']` is less than 0, while the new code fragment checks if it is not equal to 0. This change would cause the `isInfinite` method to return `true` for complex numbers with a non-zero imaginary part, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
