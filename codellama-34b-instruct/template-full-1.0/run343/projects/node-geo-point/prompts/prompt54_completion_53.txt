  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```math.sin(φ2)```
This would result in different behavior because `math.sin(φ2)` is the sine of `φ2`, while `cos` is the cosine. These trigonometric functions have different values and would produce different results in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```math.tan(φ2)```
This would result in different behavior because `math.tan(φ2)` is the tangent of `φ2`, while `cos` is the cosine. These trigonometric functions have different values and would produce different results in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```φ2```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the latitude in radians, while `cos` expects an angle in radians. The resulting value would be between -1 and 1, while `φ2` would be between 0 and 180 degrees.

DONE.
