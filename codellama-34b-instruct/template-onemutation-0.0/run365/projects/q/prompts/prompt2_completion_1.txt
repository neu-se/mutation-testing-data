  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was "bootstrap", which is a function that is not defined in the provided code snippet. Replacing it with a string "promise" would cause an error when the code is executed, as it would try to call a function that does not exist.
