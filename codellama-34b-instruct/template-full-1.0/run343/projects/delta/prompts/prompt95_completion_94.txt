  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the `newOp` element from the `this.ops` array, causing the `push` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the `newOp` element at the beginning of the `this.ops` array, causing the `push` method to always insert the new operation at the beginning instead of the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index] = newOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the existing operation at the given index with the new operation, causing the `push` method to always overwrite the existing operation instead of inserting a new one.

DONE.
