  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. `sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine of a number, while `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. `tanh` returns the hyperbolic tangent of a number, while `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `acosh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. `acosh` returns the inverse hyperbolic cosine of a number, while `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine.

DONE.
