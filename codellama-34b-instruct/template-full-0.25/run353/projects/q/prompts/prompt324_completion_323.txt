  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only throw an error if `x` and `y` are not the same, while this new code fragment would throw an error regardless of whether `x` and `y` are the same or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only return a rejection if `x` and `y` are not the same, while this new code fragment would return a rejection regardless of whether `x` and `y` are the same or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(x).join(y).then(function (result) {
    throw new Error("Q can't join
