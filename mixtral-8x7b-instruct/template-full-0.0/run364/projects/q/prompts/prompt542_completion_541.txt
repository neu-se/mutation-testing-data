 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always creates a new empty array, whereas the original code fragment reuses the `array` variable passed as an argument. This could lead to different results when the `fulfilled` function modifies the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an object with no prototype, whereas the original code fragment uses the `array` variable passed as an argument, which might have a prototype. This could lead to different results when the `fulfilled` function uses methods like `push`, `pop`, or other array-specific methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(function() { return this; })()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the global object, whereas the original code fragment reuses the `array` variable passed as an argument. This could lead to different results when the `fulfilled`
