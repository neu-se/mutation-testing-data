  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the given number of characters from the delta, whereas `retain` is a method that retains the given number of characters and applies the given attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain(0)` would retain zero characters, whereas `retain` without an argument would retain all characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain(length + 1)` would retain one more character than `retain(length)`, which could cause an off-by-one error.

DONE.
