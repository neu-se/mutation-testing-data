  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is an object, and `data[0]` would return the first element of the object, whereas the original code fragment `data` would return the entire object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is an object, and `data.length` would return the number of elements in the object, whereas the original code fragment `data` would return the entire object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is an object, and `data[key]` would return the value of the property `key` in the object, whereas the original code fragment `data` would return the entire object.

DONE.
