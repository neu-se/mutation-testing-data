  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, whereas `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a function that notifies the promise of progress, whereas `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with a value, whereas `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

DONE.
