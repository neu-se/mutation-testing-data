  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is replaced with `===` operator, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the regex matches, instead of `false` when the regex does not match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null && spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/)[0] === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `&& spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/)[0] === ''` is added, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only when the regex matches and the first match is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null && spec.match(/[^/
