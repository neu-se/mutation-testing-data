  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null !== err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition, making it always return `true` instead of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `err` to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `err` to `undefined` instead of `true`.

DONE.
