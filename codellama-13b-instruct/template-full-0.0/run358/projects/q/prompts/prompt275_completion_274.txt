  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise if the error is not null, while this code fragment always rejects the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only resolves the promise if the error is not null, while this code fragment always resolves the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only notifies the promise if the error is not null, while this code fragment always notifies the promise.

DONE.
