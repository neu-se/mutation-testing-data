  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is called with a different argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the `peek` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is called twice, which could potentially change the behavior of the `peek` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(thisIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is called with a different argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the `peek` method.

DONE.
