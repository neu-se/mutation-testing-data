  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains an invalid character, while the new code fragment checks if the path does not contain an invalid character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null && spec.match(/^\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains an invalid character, while the new code fragment checks if the path does not contain an invalid character and does not start with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null && spec.match(/^\//) !== null
```
