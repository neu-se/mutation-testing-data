  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replaceall
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` only replaces the first occurrence of the given string, while `replaceall` replaces all occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substr(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` returns a portion of the string, while `replace` returns the entire string with the specified string replaced.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a portion of the string, while `replace` returns the entire string with the specified string replaced.

DONE.
