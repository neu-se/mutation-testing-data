  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with the first element removed, which could cause the `all` function to return a promise for an array with a different length than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to return a promise for `undefined`, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to return a promise for an empty array, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned promise.

DONE.
