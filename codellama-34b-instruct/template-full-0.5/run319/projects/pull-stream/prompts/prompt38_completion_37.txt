  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` at the end of the line would cause the function to return a different value than it would have without the mutation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` at the end of the line would cause the function to return a different value than it would have without the mutation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` at the end of the line would cause the function to return a different value than it would have without the mutation.

DONE.
