  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + Math.sqrt(1 + c * c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `c + Math.sqrt(c * c + 1)`, which is a different expression. The new expression would produce a different result for certain values of `c`, leading to a different output for the `acosh` function.

DONE.
