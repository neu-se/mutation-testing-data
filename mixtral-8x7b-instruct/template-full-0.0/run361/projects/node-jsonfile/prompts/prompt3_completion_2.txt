 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + file
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to read a file from a relative path './file' instead of the provided 'file' string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file, 'utf8'
