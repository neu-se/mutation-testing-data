  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```place "null"
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` expects an array of promises, but `"null"` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```place `function() {}`
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` expects an array of promises, but a function is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```place `undefined`
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` expects an array of promises, but `undefined` is not a promise.

DONE.
