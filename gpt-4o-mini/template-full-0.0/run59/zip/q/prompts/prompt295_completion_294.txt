Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"An error occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the actual reason for the failure, it would reject with a generic string message, making it harder to diagnose the specific error that occurred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because rejecting the promise with `null` would not provide any meaningful information about the error, potentially leading to confusion when handling the rejection in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because rejecting the promise with `undefined` would also not convey any error information, which could lead to silent failures where the rejection is not properly handled or logged.

DONE.
