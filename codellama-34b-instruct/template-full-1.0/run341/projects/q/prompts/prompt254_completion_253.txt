  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the arguments passed to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, which may not be valid for the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, which may not be valid for the function.

DONE.
