Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the promise by adding 1 to the resolved value, which could lead to unexpected results when the promise resolves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of a promise will cause the `then` method to be called on `null`, leading to a TypeError when trying to access methods on `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i].catch(function() { return "error"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the handling of rejected promises by returning a string "error" instead of propagating the rejection, which could mask errors in the promise chain.

DONE.
