  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this.regex` as a property, but the mutated code is calling `this.regex` as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.prototype;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this.regex` as a property, but the mutated code is accessing the `prototype` property on `this.regex`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex new Expression();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this.regex` as a property, but the mutated code is creating a new `Expression` object and assigning it to `this.regex`.

DONE.
