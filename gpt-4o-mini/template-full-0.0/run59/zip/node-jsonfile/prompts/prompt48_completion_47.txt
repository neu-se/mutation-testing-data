Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the stringified object would cause the `writeFileSync` method to write `null` to the file, which is not the intended behavior of writing the JSON representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would lead to the file being written with the string "undefined", which is not the expected JSON string representation of the object, potentially causing issues when reading the file back.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str + 'extra data'
```
This would result in different behavior because appending 'extra data' to the stringified object would alter the content written to the file, resulting in invalid JSON data that could lead to parsing errors when the file is read back.

DONE.
