Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillieses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form is incorrectly appended with an extra 'es', which is not the standard pluralization for "chilli".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilliesy'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds a 'y' at the end instead of the correct plural form, which would lead to an invalid word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilies'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an alternative spelling for the plural form that is commonly accepted in American English, which may not match the intended British English pluralization of "chillies".

DONE.
