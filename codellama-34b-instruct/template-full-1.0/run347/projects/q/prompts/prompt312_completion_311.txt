  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the next promise in the array instead of the current one to `Q()`, causing the promise to resolve to a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the previous promise in the array instead of the current one to `Q()`, causing the promise to resolve to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first promise in the array instead of the current one to `Q()`, causing the promise to resolve to a different value.

DONE.
