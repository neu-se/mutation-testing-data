  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument would be passed to the `makeNodeResolver` function, instead of the first argument, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "foo" would be passed to the `makeNodeResolver` function, instead of a number, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function would receive a null value as its first argument, instead of a number, which would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
