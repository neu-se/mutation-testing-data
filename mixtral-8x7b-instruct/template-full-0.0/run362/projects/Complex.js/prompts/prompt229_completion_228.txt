 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * r + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant `2.0` is changed to `2`, and the order of operations is changed by removing the parentheses.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of `a` is changed inside the parentheses.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(4 * r * r + a * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression is now always positive due to the use of `Math.sqrt`, even when `a` is negative.

DONE.
