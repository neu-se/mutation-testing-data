  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject()` would immediately reject the promise, whereas the original code `defer` would create a new promise that would be resolved or rejected later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` would immediately resolve the promise, whereas the original code `defer` would create a new promise that would be resolved or rejected later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify()` would send a notification to the promise's observers, whereas the original code `defer` would create a new promise that would be resolved or rejected later.

DONE.
