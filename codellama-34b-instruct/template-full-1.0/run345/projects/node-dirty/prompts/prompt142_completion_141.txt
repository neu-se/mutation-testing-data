  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` will be passed as the `err` argument to the callback function, whereas `err` was being passed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` will be passed as the `err` argument to the callback function, whereas `err` was being passed in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` will be passed as the `err` argument to the callback function, whereas `err` was being passed in the original code.

DONE.
