  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `otherOp` object onto the `ops` array, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `thisOp` object onto the `ops` array, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `newOp` object onto the `ops` array, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
