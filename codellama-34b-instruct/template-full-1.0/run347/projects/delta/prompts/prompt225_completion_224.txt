  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
diff(strings[0].split(newline), strings[1].split(newline), cursor)
```
This would result in different behavior because the strings are being split on newline characters, but the original code fragment did not do this.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
diff(strings[0].split(' '), strings[1].split(' '), cursor)
```
This would result in different behavior because the strings are being split on spaces instead of newline characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
diff(strings.flatMap(s => s.split(newline)), cursor)
```
This would result in different behavior because the strings are being flattened and split on newline characters before being passed to the diff method.

DONE.
