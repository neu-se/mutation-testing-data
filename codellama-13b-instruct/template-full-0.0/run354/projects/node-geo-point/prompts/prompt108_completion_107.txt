  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the power of 2, while the buggy code fragment uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the power of 2 with the `zoom` variable as the exponent. This would cause the code to produce different results for different values of `zoom`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the power of 2, while the buggy code fragment uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the power of 2 with the constant value of 10 as the exponent. This would cause the code to produce different results for different values of `zoom`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, 100)
```
