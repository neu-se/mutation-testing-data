  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error with the uppercase version of the buffer, which may be different from the original buffer and could cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the beginning of the db: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error with the string "Corrupted row at the beginning of the db" instead of "Corrupted row at the end of the db", which may cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new TypeError(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a TypeError instead of an Error, which may cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
