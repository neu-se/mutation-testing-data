  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because a string starting with `http://` or `https://` would be considered an absolute URL, and would not be rewritten with `http://`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(\/\/|www\.)/
```
This would result in different behavior because a string starting with `www.` or `//` would be considered a protocol-relative URL, and would be rewritten with `http://`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?<!(http|https):\/\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because a string not starting with `http://` or `https://` would be considered a relative URL, and would be rewritten with `http://`.

DONE.
