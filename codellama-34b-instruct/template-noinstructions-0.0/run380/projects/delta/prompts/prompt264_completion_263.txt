  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes || otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the attributes from `thisOp` if they exist, even if `otherOp` has different attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes || thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the attributes from `otherOp` if they exist, even if `thisOp` has different attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes && otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the attributes from `otherOp` if `thisOp` has attributes, and would use an empty object if `thisOp` does not have attributes.

DONE.
