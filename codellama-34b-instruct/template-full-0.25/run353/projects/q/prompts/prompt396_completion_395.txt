  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to always return `undefined`, regardless of the value of the `value` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to always return `null`, regardless of the value of the `value` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return !value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to return the negation of the `value` parameter, which could result in a different resolved value.

DONE.
