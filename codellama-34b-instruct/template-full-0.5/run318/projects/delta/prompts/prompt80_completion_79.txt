  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the insertion of a new op even if the last op is not an object, which is not allowed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the insertion of a new op even if the last op does not have a delete operation, which is not allowed in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the insertion of a new op even if the last op does not have any attributes, which is not allowed in the original code.

DONE.
