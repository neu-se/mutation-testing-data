  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```ruby
Object.values.forEach(getTimezone);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of all the values in the object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of all the keys in the object. This means that in the original code, the `getTimezone` function is called once for each key in the `data.timezones` object, while in this alternative code, it would be called once for each value in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```ruby
Object.keys.forEach(getTimezone);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function once for each key in the `data.timezones` object, which is the same behavior as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```ruby
Object.getOwnPropertySymbols.forEach(getTimezone);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getO
