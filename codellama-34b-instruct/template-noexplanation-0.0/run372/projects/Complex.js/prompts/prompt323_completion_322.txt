  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This change will cause the `csc` function to return the wrong value, as it will use the cosine function instead of the sine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This change will cause the `csc` function to return the wrong value, as it will use the tangent function instead of the sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This change will cause the `csc` function to return the wrong value, as it will use the arccosine function instead of the sine function.

DONE.
