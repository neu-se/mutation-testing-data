  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Failed to load database')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a custom error message instead of the expected 'load' event with a size of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'load' event with a negative size, which would indicate that the database is empty or corrupted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'load' event with a size that is one more than the actual size of the database, which could cause issues if the caller is expecting the correct size.

DONE.
