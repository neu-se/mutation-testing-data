  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of `nodeback`, causing the code to enter one branch of the `if` statement if `nodeback` is falsy, rather than the other branch if it is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would check if `nodeback` is strictly equal to `undefined`, rather than checking if it is truthy. This would cause the code to enter one branch of the `if` statement if `nodeback` is `undefined`, rather than the other branch if it is any other value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nodeback !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would check if `nodeback` is not a function, rather than checking if it is truthy. This would cause the code to enter one
