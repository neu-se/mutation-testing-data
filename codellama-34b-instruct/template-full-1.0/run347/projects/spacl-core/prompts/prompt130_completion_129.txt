  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1; index <= count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, which would cause the first element in the array to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index >= count; index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would count down instead of up, and the comparison operator would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count/2; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over half of the elements in the array, and the comparison operator would be different.

DONE.
