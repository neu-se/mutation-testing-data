  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the empty string as a placeholder, while the new code fragment uses a space character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the empty string as a placeholder, while the new code fragment uses the string 'undefined'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the empty string as a placeholder, while the new code fragment uses the null value.

DONE.
