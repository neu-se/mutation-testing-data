  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the output of the `Math.abs` function, causing the program to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the output of the `Math.abs` function, causing the program to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
~Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the output of the `Math.abs` function, causing the program to behave differently in certain cases.

DONE.
