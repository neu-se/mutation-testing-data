  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspected.state === "fulfilled") {
    return inspected.value;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false` since the `inspected.state` property is set to `"pending"` by default.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspected.state === "rejected") {
    return inspected.value;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` since the `inspected.state` property is set to `"rejected"` by default.
