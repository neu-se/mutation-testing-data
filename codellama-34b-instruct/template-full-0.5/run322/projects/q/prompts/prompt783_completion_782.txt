  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() {
    throw new Error("Intentional error");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, regardless of the outcome of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() {
    return Q.reject("Intentional rejection");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error message, regardless of the outcome of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() {
    return Q.resolve("Intentional resolution");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a specific value, regardless of the outcome of the original promise.

DONE.
