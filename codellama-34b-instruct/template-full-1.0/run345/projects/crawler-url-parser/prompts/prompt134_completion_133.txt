  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/,'/'

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+?/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement regular expression uses a lazy quantifier to match the file extension, specifically "?", which
