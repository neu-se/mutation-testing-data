 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the normal array slice method, while `array_slice` is an internal function that might have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.slice
