 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
newOp.attributes === lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for reference equality instead of deep equality. If the attributes objects have the same properties and values but are not the same object, this would cause the comparison to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
JSON.stringify(newOp.attributes) === JSON.stringify(lastOp.attributes)
