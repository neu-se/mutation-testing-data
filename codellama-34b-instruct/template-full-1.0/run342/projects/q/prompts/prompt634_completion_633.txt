  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `.dispatch` method would not be called, resulting in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `.dispatch` method would not be called, resulting in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello, world!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the value passed to `.dispatch` would be a string, not a `Promise` object, so the code would likely fail with a type error.

DONE.
