 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would now use the longitude of `point2` instead of its latitude, which would lead to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would now use a random number instead of the latitude of `point2`, which would lead to unpredictable and incorrect distance calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-point2.latitude
