 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code writes the `str` variable to the file, while the modified code would write the string 'x' to the file, which may cause the written data to be incorrect or corrupted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
str.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code writes the `str` variable to the file, while the modified code would write the length of the `str` variable to the file, which may cause the written data to be incorrect or corrupted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code writes the `str` variable to the file, while the modified code would write a random number to the file, which may cause the written data to be incorrect or corrupted.

DONE.
