  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function would return 0 instead of 10, causing the `places` variable to be assigned a value of 0 instead of 10.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function would return -1 instead of 10, causing the `places` variable to be assigned a value of -1 instead of 10.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function would return 2 instead of 10, causing the `places` variable to be assigned a value of 2 instead of 10.

DONE.
