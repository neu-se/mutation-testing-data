  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable that is not defined in the scope of the function, and it would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function that creates a new deferred object, which is not the same as the existing `deferred` object that is being used in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply()` is a function that applies a function to a list of arguments, but it does not return a promise like the existing code fragment does.

DONE.
