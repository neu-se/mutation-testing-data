Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the URL parsing to fail for any URL, as the `URL.parse` function would not be able to correctly interpret the URL string, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `URL.parse` would likely throw an error or return an invalid object, causing the subsequent code that relies on the parsed URL to malfunction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would lead to the same issues as `null`, potentially causing the `URL.parse` function to behave incorrectly, resulting in an invalid URL object and breaking the logic that follows.

DONE.
