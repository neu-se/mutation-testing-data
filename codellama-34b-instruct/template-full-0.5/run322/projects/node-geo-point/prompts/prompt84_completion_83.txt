  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse functions, so the resulting value would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/x
```
This would result in different behavior because `1/x` would produce a different result than `cos` for non-zero values of `x`.

DONE.
