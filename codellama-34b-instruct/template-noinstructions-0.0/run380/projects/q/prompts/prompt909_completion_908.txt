  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `Q.nfapply` function would be called with one argument, whereas the replaced code fragment would call the function with zero arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `Q.nfapply` function would be called with one argument, whereas the replaced code fragment would call the function with two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `Q.nfapply` function would be called with one argument, whereas the replaced code fragment would call the function with no arguments.

DONE.
