  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(true /* PLACEHOLDER */);
```
This would result in different behavior because `parser_exit()` would be called with an argument of `true`, which would return an error instead of the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(false /* PLACEHOLDER */);
```
This would result in different behavior because `parser_exit()` would be called with an argument of `false`, which would not return an error but would still exit the parser.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("PLACEHOLDER") /* PLACEHOLDER */
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the message "PLACEHOLDER" to the console, but still return the expected result.

DONE.
