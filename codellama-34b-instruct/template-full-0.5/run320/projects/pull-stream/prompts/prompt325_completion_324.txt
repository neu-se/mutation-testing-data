  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(end && true) !== end`, which is always `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has lower precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `end || (false !== end)`, which is always `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? false : true
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator `?:` has higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(end ? false : true) !== end`, which is always `false`.

DONE.
