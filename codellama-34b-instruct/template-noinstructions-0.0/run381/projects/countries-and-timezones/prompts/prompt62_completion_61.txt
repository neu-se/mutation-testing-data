  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive an invalid country ID, which would cause it to return `null` instead of a country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive a country ID of "0", which would cause it to return a country object with an ID of "0" instead of the expected country ID.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1234567890"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive a country ID that is not present in the `data.countries` object, which would cause it to return `null` instead of a country object.

DONE.
