  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `nextStream` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to the `cb` function as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_read` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to the `cb` function as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
  return _read;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `_read` function as an anonymous function, rather than passing it as an argument to the `cb` function as the original code does.

DONE.
