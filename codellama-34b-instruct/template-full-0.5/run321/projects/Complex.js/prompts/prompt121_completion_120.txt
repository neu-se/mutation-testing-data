  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator reverses the boolean value of the expression, so `!this['isInfinite']` would be true if `this['isInfinite']` is false, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a different method that checks if a number is a finite number, which is the opposite of `isInfinite`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is `NaN`, which is different from `isInfinite`.

DONE.
