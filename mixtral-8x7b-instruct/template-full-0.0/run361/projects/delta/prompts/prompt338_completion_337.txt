 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation in the current iterator instead of the base index. This could lead to incorrect offset calculations in the `transformPosition` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always start the slice at the beginning, ignoring the current position. This could lead to incorrect slices being created in the `invert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' ? 0 : thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different length based on the type of the next operation in the current iterator. This could lead to incorrect slices being created in the `invert` method, especially when dealing with deletions or retention operations.

DONE.
