  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `path` variable as-is, while the replaced code converts it to lowercase. This could cause the `query` method to return different results for the same input, depending on whether the `path` variable contains uppercase characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `path` variable as-is, while the replaced code extracts the last segment of the path using the `split` and `pop` methods. This could cause the `query` method to return different results for the same input, depending on whether the `path` variable contains a trailing slash or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `path` variable as-is, while the replaced code removes
