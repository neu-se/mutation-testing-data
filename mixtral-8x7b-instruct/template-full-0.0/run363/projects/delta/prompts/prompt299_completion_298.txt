 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of a single line, an empty array would be passed to the predicate function, causing unexpected behavior if the predicate function is not designed to handle arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'<div></div>'
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of a Delta object, a string would be passed to the predicate function, causing unexpected behavior if the predicate function is not designed to handle strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ insert: '\n', attributes: {} }
