  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` variable would now be the first argument to the `apply` method, which could potentially cause issues with the function's functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, ref, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` variable would now be the second argument to the `apply` method, and the function would now be called with three arguments, which could potentially cause issues with the function's functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref, null, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` variable would now be the second argument to the `apply` method, and the function would now be called with two arguments, which could potentially cause issues with the function's functionality.

DONE.
