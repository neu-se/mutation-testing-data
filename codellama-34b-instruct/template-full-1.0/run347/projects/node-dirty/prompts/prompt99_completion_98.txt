  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`, { stack: '' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any options to the `Error` constructor, while the mutated code fragment passes `{ stack: '' }`, which would prevent the error from including a stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`, { code: 'EINVAL' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any options to the `Error` constructor, while the mutated code fragment passes `{ code: 'EINVAL' }`, which would set the error code to "EINVAL" instead of the default "unknown".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`, { cause: new Error('some other error') })
```
This would result in different behavior
