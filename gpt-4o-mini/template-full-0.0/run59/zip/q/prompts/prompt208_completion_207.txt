Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the function with a specified `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` passes the arguments as an array, potentially leading to incorrect context or argument handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` as the `this` context means that the function will not have access to the correct context, which could lead to errors if the callback relies on `this` being set to a specific object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(this)();
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, but it does not pass the original arguments to the callback, which could lead to unexpected results or errors if the callback expects arguments.

DONE.
