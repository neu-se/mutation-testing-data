Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `baseOp` variable instead of the current operation `op`, potentially leading to incorrect deletions if `baseOp` does not match the intended operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the `inverted.delete` method to be called with an undefined length, which could lead to unexpected results or errors during the inversion process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete based on the retain value of the operation instead of its length, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operation's effects on the Delta structure.

DONE.
