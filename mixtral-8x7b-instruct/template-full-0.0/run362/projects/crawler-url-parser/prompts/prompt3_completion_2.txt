 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null values instead of checking if the `currentUrlStr` variable is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr === undefined || currentUrlStr === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it also checks for empty strings, which might not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!currentUrlStr
