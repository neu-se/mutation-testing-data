  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisIter.peekLength()` function returns the length of the current operation, while the original code fragment returns the length of the current operation minus the length of the previous operation. This change would cause the `compose` function to behave differently when the first operation in the `other` delta is a retain operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peekLength()` function returns the length of the current operation, while the original code fragment returns the length of the current operation minus the length of the previous operation. This change would cause the `compose` function to behave differently when the first operation in the `other` delta is a retain operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior
