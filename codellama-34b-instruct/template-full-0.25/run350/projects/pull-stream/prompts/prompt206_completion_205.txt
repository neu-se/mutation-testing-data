  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `aborted` variable, causing the code to execute the `else` block when `aborted` is `true`, and the `if` block when `aborted` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator evaluates to `true` if both `aborted` and `true` are `true`, and to `false` otherwise. This would cause the code to execute the `if` block when `aborted` is `true`, and the `else` block when `aborted` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator evaluates to `true` if either `aborted` or `false` is `true`, and to `false` otherwise. This would
