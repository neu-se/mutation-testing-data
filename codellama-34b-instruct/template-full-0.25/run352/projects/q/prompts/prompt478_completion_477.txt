  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would not remove any elements from the array, as the starting index is 0, and the number of elements to remove is 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove one element from the end of the array, as the starting index is -1, and the number of elements to remove is 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove all elements from the array, as the starting index is the length of the array, and the number of elements to remove is 1.

DONE.
