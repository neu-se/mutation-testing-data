  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer, whereas `parseFloat` returns the floating-point value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.parseInt` returns the integer value of a number, whereas `parseFloat` returns the floating-point value of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.prototype.slice` returns a new string that is a substring of the original string, whereas `parseFloat` returns the floating-point value of a number.

DONE.
