  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(null, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the current URL to `null`, effectively removing it from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value for the current URL to `undefined`, which would be a falsey value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the key and value for the current URL to the same value, effectively adding the URL as a self-referential link.

DONE.
