  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.constructor === Object
```
This code fragment checks if `s` is an object by checking if its constructor is the built-in `Object` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s === 'object' && s.constructor !== Object
```
This code fragment checks if `s` is an object by checking if its type is `'object'` and its constructor is not the built-in `Object` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s === 'object' && s.constructor === Array
```
This code fragment checks if `s` is an array by checking if its type is `'object'` and its constructor is the built-in `Array` constructor.

DONE.
