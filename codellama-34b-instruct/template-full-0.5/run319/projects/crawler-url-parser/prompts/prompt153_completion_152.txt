  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last part of the linkurl_path, which is not the intention of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "a")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the last part of the linkurl_path with "a", which is not the intention of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\1")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the last part of the linkurl_path with the first capture group, which is not the intention of the original code.

DONE.
