  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of a path, while `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.cwd` returns the current working directory, while `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(__dirname, '..')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, while `(__dirname, '..')` returns the parent directory of the current file.

DONE.
