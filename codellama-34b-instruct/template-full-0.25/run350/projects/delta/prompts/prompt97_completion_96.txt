  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with a `start` index of 1, instead of 0, which would cause the new element to be inserted at a different position in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with a `start` index of -1, which would cause the new element to be inserted at the end of the array, instead of at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with a `start` index of the length of the `ops` array, which would cause the new element to be inserted at the end of the array, instead of at the beginning.

DONE.
