  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property is not always defined on the `currentUrl` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property is not always defined on the `currentUrl` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.querycount
```
This would result in different behavior because the `querycount` property is not always defined on the `currentUrl` object.

DONE.
