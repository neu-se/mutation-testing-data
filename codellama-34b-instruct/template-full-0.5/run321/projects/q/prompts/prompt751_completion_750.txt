  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the rejection value, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the rejection value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise with the rejection value, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the rejection value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would reject the promise with the rejection value, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the rejection value.

DONE.
