  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `math.cos(b)` would return the cosine of `b`, whie `a` is not used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
math.sin(a+b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `math.sin(a+b)` would return the sine of `a+b`, whie `a` is not used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
math.tan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `math.tan(a)` would return the tangent of `a`, whie `a` is not used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
