  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot
```
This would result in different behavior because `filterNot` is a different function than `filter`, and it would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `filterNot` function with the `test` argument, which is not what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `filter` function with the `test` argument, which is not what the original code does.

DONE.
