  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the next value in the array, while this code fragment returns the current value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the next value in the array, while this code fragment returns the current value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i-1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the next value in the array, while this code fragment returns the previous value.

DONE.
