  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaced the protocol with "http://" if it was "//", but this new code fragment would replace the protocol with "http://" if it was "https://" as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!https?:\/\/).*/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaced the protocol with "http://" if it was "//", but this new code fragment would replace the protocol with "http://" if it was any other protocol (e.g. "ftp://", "mailto:", etc.).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!https?:\/\/).*/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaced the protocol with "http://" if it was "//", but this new code fragment
