  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method expects a `GeoPoint` object as the first argument, but `null` is not a valid `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method expects a `GeoPoint` object with non-zero latitude and longitude values, but `new GeoPoint(0, 0)` creates a `GeoPoint` object with latitude and longitude values of 0, which is not a valid destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method expects a `GeoPoint` object as the first argument, but `this.longitude` is not a valid `GeoPoint` object.

DONE.
