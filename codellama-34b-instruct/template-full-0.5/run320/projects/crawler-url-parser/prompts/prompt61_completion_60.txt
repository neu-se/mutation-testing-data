  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, {fragment: false})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fragment` option is set to `false`, which would remove the fragment from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, {search: true})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` option is set to `true`, which would include the query string in the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, {hash: 'foo'})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hash` option is set to `'foo'`, which would add a hash to the URL.

DONE.
