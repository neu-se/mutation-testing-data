  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterias'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replacement code fragment is a plural noun. The test suite should catch this difference in behavior, as it is a significant change to the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a plural noun, while the replacement code fragment is a singular noun. The test suite should catch this difference in behavior, as it is a significant change to the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a singular noun, while the replacement code fragment is a plural noun. The test suite should catch this difference in behavior, as it is a significant change to the code.

DONE.
