  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `nearer` function to return the fulfillment value even if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the value is a promise-like object, which could have different behavior than checking if it is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is fulfilled, which could cause the `nearer` function to return the fulfillment value even if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
