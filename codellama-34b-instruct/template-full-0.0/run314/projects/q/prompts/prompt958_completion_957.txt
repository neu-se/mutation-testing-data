  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is not called, and the promise is resolved with `undefined` instead of the bound function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is not called, and the promise is resolved with an empty function instead of the bound function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (x) { return x + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is not called, and the promise is resolved with a function that adds 1 to its argument instead of the bound function.

DONE.
