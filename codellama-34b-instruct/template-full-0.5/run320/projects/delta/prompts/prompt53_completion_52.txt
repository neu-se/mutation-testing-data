  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this code checks if it is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this code checks if it is not strictly equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof handler !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is an object, while this code checks if its type is not 'object'.

DONE.
