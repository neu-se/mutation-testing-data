  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if there are in-flight writes. This will prevent the `drain` event from being emitted, which could cause issues for code that relies on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if there are no in-flight writes. This will cause the `drain` event to be emitted more frequently than necessary, which could cause performance issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites === 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if there are in-flight writes. This will cause the `drain` event to be emitted more frequently than necessary, which could
