  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert()
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert()` is a method that inserts a new element into the delta, whereas `push()` is a method that adds an element to the end of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` is a method that removes and returns the last element of the delta, whereas `push()` is a method that adds an element to the end of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift()` is a method that adds an element to the beginning of the delta, whereas `push()` is a method that adds an element to the end of the delta.

DONE.
