  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === 'wrong'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return 'wrong' for all key-value pairs, causing the loop to break and the wrong result to be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(val, key) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would receive the key as the first argument and the value as the second argument, causing the function to return the opposite result for all key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null for all key-value pairs, causing the loop to break and the wrong result to be returned.

DONE.
