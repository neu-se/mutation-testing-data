  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `delete()` only removes the element with the specified key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` sets the value of the element with the specified key, whereas `delete()` removes the element with the specified key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `get()` returns the value of the element with the specified key, whereas `delete()` removes the element with the specified key.

DONE.
