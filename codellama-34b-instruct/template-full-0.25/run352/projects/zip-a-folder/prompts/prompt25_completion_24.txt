  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enable gzip compression even if the `archiverOptions` object is undefined or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions && { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enable gzip compression only if the `archiverOptions` object is defined and not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ gzip: archiverOptions?.gzip }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enable gzip compression only if the `gzip` property of the `archiverOptions` object is truthy.

DONE.
