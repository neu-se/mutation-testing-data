  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "Not" operator (!) to check if "countries" is falsey, while this code fragment checks if the length of the "countries" array is greater than 0. If the array is empty, the original code fragment would return false, while this code fragment would return true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "Not" operator (!) to check if "countries" is falsey, while this code fragment checks if the first element of the "countries" array is undefined. If the array is empty, the original code fragment would return false, while this code fragment would return true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!countries[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "Not" operator (!
