 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove two characters from the stack trace instead of one, changing the output of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("Error") + 6)
