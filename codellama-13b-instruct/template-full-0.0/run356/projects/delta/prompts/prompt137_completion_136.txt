  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `firstOther.attributes` check is now inverted, which would cause the code to behave differently when the `firstOther` object has attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `firstOther.attributes` check is now removed, which would cause the code to behave differently when the `firstOther` object has attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes === 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `firstOther.attributes` check is now comparing against a string literal `'foo'`, which
