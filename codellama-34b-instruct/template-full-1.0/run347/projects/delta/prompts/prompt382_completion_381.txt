  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<NULL-SAFE>);
```
This would result in different behavior because `NULL` is a valid value for `otherIter.next()`, but it is not a valid value for `thisIter.next()` and will result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<ANY-OBJECT>);
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` expects a value of type `OpIterator`, but `thisIter.next()` expects a value of type `OpIterator`. Passing a value of an incorrect type will result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<ANY-STRING>);
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` expects a value of type `OpIterator`, but `thisIter.next()` expects a value of type `String`. Passing a value of an incorrect type will result in
