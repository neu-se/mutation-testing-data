  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.get(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `request` function, which is a custom function that is not defined in the code snippet provided. The `request.get()` method is a method of the `request` object, which is not defined in the code snippet either.

DONE.
