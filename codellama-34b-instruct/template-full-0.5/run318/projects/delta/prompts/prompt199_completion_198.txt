  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate over the remaining ops in the iterator, rather than over the entire iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate over the remaining ops in the `other` iterator, rather than over the entire `this` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate over an empty iterator, which would not have the same behavior as iterating over the entire `this` iterator.

DONE.
