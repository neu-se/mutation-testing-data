Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the `stringify` function would likely cause it to throw an error or return a string representation of `null`, instead of serializing the actual object, leading to unexpected results when writing to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of the actual object would cause the `stringify` function to return the string "undefined", which is not a valid JSON representation, potentially leading to an error when the file is read back.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty object to the `stringify` function would serialize it as "{}", which is a valid JSON but does not represent the original object, leading to loss of data when the file is written.

DONE.
