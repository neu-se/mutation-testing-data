 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` value would be replaced with the `data` value, which might not be what the developer intended. This could cause issues if the `aborted` value is used for error handling or control flow later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` value would be replaced with `undefined`, which might not be handled correctly by the code that uses the `aborted` value. This could cause unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object would be passed to the callback instead of the `aborted` value. This could cause the error handling code to be triggered, even if the error was not actually caused by an aborted operation.

DONE.
