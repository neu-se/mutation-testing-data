  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `closed.resolve` function is called when the queue is closed, which resolves the `closed` promise and allows the consumer to read the value of the promise. However, replacing it with `closed.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected instead, which would cause the consumer to receive an error instead of the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `closed.resolve` function is called when the queue is closed, which resolves the `closed` promise and allows the consumer to read the value of the promise. However, replacing it with `closed.resolved` would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value, which would affect the behavior of the consumer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.then
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code
