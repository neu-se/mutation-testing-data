  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` is a different variable than `x`, and the `join` method would return a rejection instead of the value of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, and the `join` method would return a rejection instead of the value of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, and the `join` method would return a rejection instead of the value of `x`.

DONE.
