  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a function that schedules a callback to be called on the next tick of the event loop, whereas `process.nextTick()` calls the function immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` schedules a callback to be called after a specified delay (in this case, 0 milliseconds), whereas `process.nextTick` schedules a callback to be called on the next tick of the event loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` schedules a callback to be called on the next tick of the event loop, whereas `process.nextTick` schedules a callback to be called on the next tick of the event loop.

DONE.
