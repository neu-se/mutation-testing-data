  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && err
```
This would result in different behavior because when `end` is truthy, the original code would return `err` as the second argument to `cb`, which would be interpreted as an error. In contrast, the mutated code would return the result of `end && err`, which would be `err` if `end` is truthy, or `null` if `end` is falsy. This could potentially change the behavior of the program, depending on the context in which it is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || err
```
This would result in different behavior because when `end` is falsy, the original code would return `err` as the second argument to `cb`, which would be interpreted as an error. In contrast, the mutated code would return the result of `end || err`, which would be `err` if `end` is falsy, or `null` if `end` is truthy. This could potentially change the behavior of the program, depending on
