  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `basis` by 1, which could cause the `reduce` method to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of `basis` by 1, which could cause the `reduce` method to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `basis`, which could cause the `reduce` method to produce a different result.

DONE.
