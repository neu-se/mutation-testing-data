  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong verb to the `Python-style generator` case, causing an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"argument"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong verb to the `ES6 Generators` case, causing the generator to be called with an invalid verb.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value as the verb to both cases, causing an error to be thrown.

DONE.
