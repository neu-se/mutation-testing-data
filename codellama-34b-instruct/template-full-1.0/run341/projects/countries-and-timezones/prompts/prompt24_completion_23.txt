  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-zero value for the utcOffset, while the mutated code would always return a offset of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-zero value for the utcOffset, while the mutated code would use the dstOffset value instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-zero value for the utcOffset, while the mutated code would add 1 to the utcOffset and then use the getOffsetStr function to format the resulting value.

DONE.
