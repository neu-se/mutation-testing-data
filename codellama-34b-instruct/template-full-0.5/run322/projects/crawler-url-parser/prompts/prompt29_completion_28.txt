  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `currentUrlStr` to lowercase, which could potentially change the result of the `URL.parse()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first character of the `currentUrlStr`, which could potentially change the result of the `URL.parse()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the `currentUrlStr`, which could potentially change the result of the `URL.parse()` method.

DONE.
