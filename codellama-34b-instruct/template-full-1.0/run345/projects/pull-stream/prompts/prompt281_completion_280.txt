  Sure, I can help you with that! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
                       //Buggy Code Option 1
 mapper = prop(mapper).call(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `prop` function with `arguments` as the context, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
                       //Buggy Code Option 2
 mapper = prop(mapper).bind(this)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `prop` function to the current context and call it immediately, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
                       //Buggy Code Option 3
 mapper = prop(mapper)({})
```
This would result in different behavior because it
