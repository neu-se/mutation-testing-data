  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl, baseUrlStr)

This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter is not passed to the `parse` function, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter is not passed to the `parse` function, which could cause the function to return a different result.
