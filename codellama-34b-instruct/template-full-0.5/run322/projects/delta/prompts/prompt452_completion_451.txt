  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.hasNext` is a boolean value, and adding 1 to it would make it always evaluate to true, even when the iterator has no more elements. This would cause the `rest` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.length` is the number of elements in the `ops` array, and it is not related to the current index of the iterator. Using this value in the `rest` method would cause it to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.index` is the current index of the iterator, and it is not related to the number of elements in the `ops` array. Using this value in the `rest` method would cause it to return an incorrect result.
