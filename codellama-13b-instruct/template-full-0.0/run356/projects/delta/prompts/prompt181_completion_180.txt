  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by 1 element, rather than the entire element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not advance the iterator at all, and would therefore result in an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator to the end of the array, and would therefore result in an infinite loop.

DONE.
