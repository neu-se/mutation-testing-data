  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).when
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).all
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
