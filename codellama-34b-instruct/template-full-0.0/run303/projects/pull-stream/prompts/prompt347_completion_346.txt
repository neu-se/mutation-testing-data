  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, but `data[0]` would be the first character of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, but `data.length` would be the length of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, but `data.toUpperCase()` would be the string in uppercase.

DONE.
