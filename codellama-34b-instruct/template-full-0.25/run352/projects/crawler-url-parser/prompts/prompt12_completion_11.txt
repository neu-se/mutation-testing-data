  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `https` protocol would be used instead of `http`, which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + 'www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `www.` subdomain would be added to the URL, which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + 'example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `example.com` domain would be used instead of the original domain, which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting.

DONE.
