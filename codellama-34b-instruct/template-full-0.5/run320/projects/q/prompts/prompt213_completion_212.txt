  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the value as a promise-like object, even if it doesn't have a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only treat the value as a promise-like object if it has a `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the value as a promise-like object if it has a `then` method, and would not treat it as a promise-like object if it doesn't have a `then` method.

DONE.
