  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to '-', while this new code fragment checks if `c` is not equal to '-'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to '-', while this new code fragment checks if `c` is equal to '+'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to '-', while this new code fragment checks if `c` is equal to a space character.

DONE.
