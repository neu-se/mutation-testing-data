  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of the complex number, while this code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of the complex number, while this code fragment calculates the hyperbolic sine of the real part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh(a) * Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the tangent of the complex number, while this code fragment calculates the hyperbolic tangent of the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
