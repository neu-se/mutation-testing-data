  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
		attributes.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the revised code would always return the number of attribute keys in the map, rather than the actual attributes metadata.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
		attributes.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the revised code would always return an iterable of the attribute keys in the map, rather than the actual attributes metadata.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
		attributes.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the revised code would always return an iterable of the attribute values in the map, rather than the actual attributes metadata.

DONE.
