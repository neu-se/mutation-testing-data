  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("", "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is replacing the first occurrence of a substring with an empty string, while the new code fragment is replacing all occurrences of a substring with an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is replacing the first occurrence of a substring with a fixed string, while the new code fragment is replacing all occurrences of a substring with a fixed string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/(^\/?)/, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is replacing the first occurrence of a substring with an empty string, while the new code fragment is replacing all occurrences of a substring with an empty string.

DONE.
