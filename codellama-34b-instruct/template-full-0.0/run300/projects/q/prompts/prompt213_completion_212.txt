  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.then` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `isPromiseAlike(value)` is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether `value` is a promise or a thenable object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.catch` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the error that occurred in the original promise, whereas `isPromiseAlike(value)` is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether `value` is a promise or a thenable object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.finally` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, whereas `isPromiseAlike(value)` is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether `value` is a promise or a
