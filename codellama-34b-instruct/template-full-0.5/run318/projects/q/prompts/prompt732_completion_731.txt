  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable is only decremented when a promise is rejected, so it will never be less than zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable is only incremented when a promise is resolved, so it will never be equal to the length of the `promises` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable is only decremented when a promise is rejected, so it will never be greater than zero.

DONE.
