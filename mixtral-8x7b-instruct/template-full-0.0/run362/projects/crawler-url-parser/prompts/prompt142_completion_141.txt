 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will no longer have a replacement string, effectively removing the matched part instead of replacing it with '/'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/default\.[a-z]+$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will no longer have a replacement string, effectively preserving the matched part instead of replacing it with '/'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/default\.[A-Z]+$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-sensitive, and will not match strings with lowercase extensions.
