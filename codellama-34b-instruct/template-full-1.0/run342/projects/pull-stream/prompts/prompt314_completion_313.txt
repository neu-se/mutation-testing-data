  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, data]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return an array with the value `null` as its first element, even if the input data is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the length of the input data, rather than the number of items that meet the condition `test(data)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `NaN` as a result of the `Number` conversion, even if the input data is a number.

DONE.
