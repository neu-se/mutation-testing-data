  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] < 0 && Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a['abs']` is not finite and `a['arg']` is finite, while this code fragment checks if `a['abs']` is less than 0 and `a['arg']` is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite(a['abs']) && !Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a['abs']` is not finite and `a['arg']` is finite, while this code fragment checks if both `a['abs']` and `a['arg']` are not finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN(a['abs']) && Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior
