  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would be called twice, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would be called with a different argument, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would be called with a different argument, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
