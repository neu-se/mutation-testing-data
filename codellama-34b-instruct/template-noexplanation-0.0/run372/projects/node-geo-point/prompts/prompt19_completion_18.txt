  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && !Array.isArray(object.coordinates)
```
This code fragment checks if the `object` is an object and if its `coordinates` property is not an array. This change will cause the `fromObject` method to throw a `TypeError` if the `coordinates` property is not an array, which is different from the original behavior where it only checks if the `object` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && object.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This code fragment checks if the `object` is an object and if its `coordinates` property is not an array with two elements. This change will cause the `fromObject` method to throw a `TypeError` if the `coordinates` property is not an array with two elements, which is different from the original behavior where it only checks if the `object` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && object.
