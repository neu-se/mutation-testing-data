Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined` instead of the original value, potentially leading to unexpected results in promise chains.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the original value incremented by 1, altering the expected output of the promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("Intentional Error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning the value, causing the promise to be rejected rather than fulfilled.

DONE.
