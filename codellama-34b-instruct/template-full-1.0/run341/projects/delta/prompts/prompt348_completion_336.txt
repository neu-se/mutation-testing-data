  To test the `invert` method of the `Delta` class, you can replace the `PLACEHOLDER` with the following code fragments:

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
opData - baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opData` and `baseOpData` objects may have different values, leading to an incorrect result when the `AttributeMap.invert` method is called.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
opData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opData` object may have a different structure or values than the `baseOpData` object, leading to an incorrect result when the `AttributeMap.invert` method is called.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
[opData]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[opData]` object may have a different structure or values than the `baseOpData` object, leading to an incorrect result when the `AttributeMap.in
