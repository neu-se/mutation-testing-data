  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This change will cause the `post` method to receive one fewer argument than it should, which may cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This change will cause the `post` method to receive two fewer arguments than it should, which may cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This change will cause the `post` method to receive three fewer arguments than it should, which may cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
