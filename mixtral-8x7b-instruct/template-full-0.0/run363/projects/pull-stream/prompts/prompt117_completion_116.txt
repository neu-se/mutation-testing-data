 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length >= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition would allow the function to execute with 2 or more arguments, whereas the original condition only allowed it to execute with exactly 2 arguments. This could potentially cause unexpected behavior in the function if it is not designed to handle more than 2 arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always execute, regardless of the number of arguments provided. This could potentially cause unexpected behavior if the function is not designed to handle a lack of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reducer && acc && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only execute if all three variables (reducer, acc, and cb) are truthy. This could potentially cause the function to not execute in certain cases where it should, or to execute in cases where it should not.

DONE.
