  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key' in JSON.parse(rowStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because `key` would always return true, even if `rowStr` does not contain `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'val' in JSON.parse(rowStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because `val` would always return true, even if `rowStr` does not contain `val`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(rowStr).hasOwnProperty('key'').
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the property is on the object itself, not on the prototype chain, which could lead to different results if the object was inherited from another class.

DONE.
