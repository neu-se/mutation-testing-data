  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the string "index.html" but not the string "index.htm".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the string "index.html" but not the string "index.htm".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the string "index.html" but not the string "index.htm".

DONE.
