  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a resolved promise, regardless of the outcome of the original operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a rejected promise, regardless of the outcome of the original operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `fapply` method of the `Q` module, regardless of the outcome of the original operation.

DONE.
