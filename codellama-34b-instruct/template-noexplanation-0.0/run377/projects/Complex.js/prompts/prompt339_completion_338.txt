  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 1
```
This change will cause the `asec` function to return a different result than the original code, which is `new Complex(0, Infinity)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === -1
```
This change will cause the `asec` function to return a different result than the original code, which is `new Complex(0, -Infinity)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1 && b === 0
```
This change will cause the `asec` function to return a different result than the original code, which is `new Complex(Math.PI / 2, Infinity)`.

DONE.
