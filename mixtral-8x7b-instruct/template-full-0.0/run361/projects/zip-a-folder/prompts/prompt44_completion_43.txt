 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive['directory']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `directory` method using bracket notation instead of dot notation, which can lead to issues if the `directory` property is not defined in the `zipArchive` object or if it is defined as a getter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive.bulk([{src, dest: ''}])
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `bulk()` method with an array containing a single object, which has the `src` property set to the original `src` value and an empty `dest` property. This would cause the method to add all files from the `src` directory to the root of the archive, instead of preserving the directory structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive.directory(src, false, {date: new Date(0)})
