  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh + z['im'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the result would be flipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the result would be flipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh + z['im'] * arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the result would be increased by 1.

DONE.
