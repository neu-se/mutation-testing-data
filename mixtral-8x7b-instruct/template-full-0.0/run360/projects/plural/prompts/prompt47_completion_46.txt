 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'x' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now appends 'x' instead of 's' to the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() + 'S' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function converts the input word to uppercase and appends 'S' instead of appending 's' to the original word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function removes the last character of the input word instead of appending 's'.

DONE.
