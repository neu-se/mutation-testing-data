  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the argument to `cos` is inverted, which would cause the function to return the opposite angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is a different function and would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cot
```
This would result in different behavior because `cot` is a different function and would return a different value.

DONE.
