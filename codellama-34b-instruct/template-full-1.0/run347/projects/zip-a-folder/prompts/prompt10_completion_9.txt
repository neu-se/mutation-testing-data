  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isGlob` is the negation of `isGlob`, which means that the `zipArchive.glob()` method would be called even if `src` is not a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.indexOf('.') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `src.indexOf('.')` checks if the `src` string contains a dot, which is not necessarily the same as checking if it is a glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof src === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof src === 'string'` checks if `src` is a string, which is not necessarily the same as checking if it is a glob.

DONE.
