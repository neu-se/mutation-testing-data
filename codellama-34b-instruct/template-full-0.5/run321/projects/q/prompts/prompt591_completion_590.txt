  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` checks if any element of the array passes the test, while `all` checks if all elements of the array pass the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` creates a new array with all elements that pass the test, while `all` checks if all elements of the array pass the test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` creates a new array with the results of calling a function on every element, while `all` checks if all elements of the array pass the test.

DONE.
