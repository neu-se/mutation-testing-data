  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if there are no more elements in the iterator, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue only if there are more elements in the iterator and the next element is not an insert operation, leading to a different sequence of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue only if there are more elements in the iterator and the next element is an insert operation, leading to a different sequence of operations.

DONE.
