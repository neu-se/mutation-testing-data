Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'GET'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `verb` to a constant value ('GET'), which means that the method will always deny the 'GET' action regardless of the input, potentially leading to incorrect access control.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `verb` to the first element of the `verbs` array, which may not represent the current verb being processed in the loop, leading to incorrect denial of verbs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'POST' === 'GET' ? 'POST' : 'GET'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a conditional expression that will always assign 'GET' to `verb`, effectively denying all verbs since it does not consider the actual verbs being passed to the method.

DONE.
