  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the scope of the function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not modified, and the `+ 1` operation would not affect the result of the `cosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not modified, and the `* 2` operation would not affect the result of the `cosh` function.

DONE.
