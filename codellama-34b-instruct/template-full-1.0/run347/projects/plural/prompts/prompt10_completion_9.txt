  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern would no longer match the intended words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern would no longer match the intended words, and the flag "i" was removed, which makes the pattern case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern would no longer match the intended words, and the flag "i" was removed, which makes the pattern case-sensitive.

DONE.
