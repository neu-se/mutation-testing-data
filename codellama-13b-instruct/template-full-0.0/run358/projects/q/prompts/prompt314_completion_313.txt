  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `Q.race` function, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `Q.race` function with an additional argument. This would cause the `Q.race` function to be called with an additional argument, which could result in different behavior depending on how the function is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `Q.race` function, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `Q.all` function. This would cause the `Q.all` function to be called instead of the `Q.race` function, which could result in different behavior depending on how the functions are implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `
