  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getCountry` method with the `id` argument, which would return a country object, but it would not memoize the country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeCountry(country)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would memoize the country object, but it would not return it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deliverCountry(countries[id], options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would deliver the memoized country object, but it would not memoize it again.

DONE.
