  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.includes(country)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the truthiness of the `countries` array, while this code fragment checks if the `countries` array includes the `country` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.indexOf(country) >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the truthiness of the `countries` array, while this code fragment checks if the `country` variable is a member of the `countries` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!countries.split(",").includes(country)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the truthiness of the `countries` array, while this code fragment checks if the `country` variable is a member of the `countries` array, but first splits `countries` by commas into a new array.
