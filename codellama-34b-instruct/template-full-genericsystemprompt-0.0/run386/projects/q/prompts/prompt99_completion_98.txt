  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length; index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2; index < length; index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < length; index += 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over every third element in the array.

DONE.
