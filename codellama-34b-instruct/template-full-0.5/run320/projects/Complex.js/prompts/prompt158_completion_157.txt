  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero` checks if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0 && z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks if both the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are zero, while `isZero` only checks the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['abs']() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the absolute value of the complex number is zero, while `isZero` only checks the real part.

DONE.
