  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `encoding` property of the `options` object as the second argument to the `stringify` function, instead of the `obj` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `reviver` property of the `options` object as the second argument to the `stringify` function, instead of the `obj` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `throws` property of the `options` object as the second argument to the `stringify` function, instead of the `obj` object.

DONE.
