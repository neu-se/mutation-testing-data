Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(otherOp.delete);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove a specified number of operations from the `delta` instead of adding the `otherOp`, potentially leading to loss of data that should have been preserved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from `thisIter` instead of `otherOp`, which could lead to incorrect composition of operations and an unexpected result in the final `delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push({ delete: otherOp.delete });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new operation with only the `delete` property from `otherOp`, ignoring other properties and potentially altering the intended operation composition.

DONE.
