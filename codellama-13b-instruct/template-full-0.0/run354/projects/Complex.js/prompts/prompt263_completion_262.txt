  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is changed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is the same as the first argument.

DONE.
