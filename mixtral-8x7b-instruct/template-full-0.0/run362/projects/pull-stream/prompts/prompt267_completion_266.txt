 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextStream` function would continue executing even when the `read` function returns an 'end' signal, potentially causing the function to read past the end of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextStream` function to immediately call `nextChunk` with the current `stream` value, instead of waiting for the `read` function to return it. This could cause the function to skip the first chunk of data in the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values(stream) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextStream` function to always return `true` as the 'end' signal, even if the `values` function returns an error. This could cause the function to continue reading from the stream even when it has reached the end, potentially causing it to enter an
