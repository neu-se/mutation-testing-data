  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of the array, while `pop` removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` removes the first element of the array, while `pop` removes the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array with the first element removed, while `pop` removes the last element.

DONE.
