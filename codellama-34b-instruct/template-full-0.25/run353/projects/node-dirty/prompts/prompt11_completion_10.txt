  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `has` returns a boolean indicating whether the key exists in the map, whereas `get` returns the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` returns the number of key-value pairs in the map, whereas `get` returns the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` returns an iterator over the keys in the map, whereas `get` returns the value associated with the key.

DONE.
