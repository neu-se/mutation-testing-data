  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `options.dest` is strictly equal to `null`. If `options.dest` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or an empty string), the original code fragment would still evaluate to `true`, while this new code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
