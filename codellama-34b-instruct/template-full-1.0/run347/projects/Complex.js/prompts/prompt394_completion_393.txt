  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, whereas the original code fragment returns `a` which is a variable and can have different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string 'string', whereas the original code fragment returns `a` which is a variable and can have different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the complex number 1 + 2i, whereas the original code fragment returns `a` which is a variable and can have different values.

DONE.
