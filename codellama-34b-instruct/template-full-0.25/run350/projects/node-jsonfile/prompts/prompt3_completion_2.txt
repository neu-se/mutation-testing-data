  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing a file object to the `readFile` method, while the new code fragment is passing a string representation of the file object. This could cause the `readFile` method to behave differently, such as throwing an error if it expects a file object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing a file object to the `readFile` method, while the new code fragment is passing the name of the file as a string. This could cause the `readFile` method to behave differently, such as throwing an error if it expects a file object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing a file object to the `readFile` method, while the new code fragment is passing the size of the file as a number. This could cause
