Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves and removes the next operation from the iterator instead of just peeking at the current operation, potentially altering the state of the iterator and affecting subsequent operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `thisIter` iterator instead of the `iter` iterator, which may lead to inconsistencies in the operations being processed, as they are not guaranteed to be the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new empty `Delta` instance instead of referencing the current operation, which would mean that no operations are added to the line, effectively ignoring the current operation entirely.

DONE.
