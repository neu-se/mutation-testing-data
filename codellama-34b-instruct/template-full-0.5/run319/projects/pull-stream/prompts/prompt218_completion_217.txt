  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a different variable than `err`, and it may not be an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `aborted`, and it may not be an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a different variable than `err`, and it may not be an error.

DONE.
