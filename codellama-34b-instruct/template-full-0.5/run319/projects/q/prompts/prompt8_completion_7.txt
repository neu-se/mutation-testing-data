  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console instead of defining a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var x = 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a variable `x` with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(x);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the value of `x` to the console instead of defining a variable.

DONE.
