Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, whereas the original `Math.floor` rounds down, potentially changing the calculated hours in the offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer, which could produce different results than `Math.floor` for certain input values, affecting the hours in the offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset => offset / 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly divides by 60 without applying any rounding, which could lead to a non-integer value for hours, potentially causing issues when concatenated into the offset string.

DONE.
