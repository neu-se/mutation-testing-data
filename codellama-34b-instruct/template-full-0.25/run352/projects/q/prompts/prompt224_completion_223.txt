  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is the prototype of all objects in JavaScript, and replacing `Promise.prototype` with it would cause the `promise` object to inherit from `Object.prototype` instead of `Promise.prototype`. This could potentially cause issues with the `promise` object's behavior and functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value in JavaScript, and replacing `Promise.prototype` with it would cause the `promise` object to inherit from `null` instead of `Promise.prototype`. This could potentially cause issues with the `promise` object's behavior and functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value in JavaScript, and replacing `Promise.prototype` with it would cause the `promise` object to inherit
