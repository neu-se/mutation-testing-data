Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the latitude instead of using the longitude, which would lead to incorrect geographical positioning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the longitude value instead of using it as is, which would distort the intended geographical location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the absolute value of the longitude, potentially changing the sign and thus altering the geographical representation.

DONE.
