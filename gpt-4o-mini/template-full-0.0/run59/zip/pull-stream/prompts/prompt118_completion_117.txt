Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to only return the callback if `end` is explicitly `false`, which could lead to cases where the callback is not invoked when it should be, potentially causing silent failures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `data` is truthy instead of checking `end`, which could lead to the callback being invoked incorrectly based on the data received rather than the end signal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `end` is not `null`, which could lead to the callback being invoked even when `end` is a valid error signal, thus misinterpreting the end of the stream.

DONE.
