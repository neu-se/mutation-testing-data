  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `undefined` are not the same thing, and `resolver` may be `null` but not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `undefined` are not the same thing, and `resolver` may be `null` but not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolver !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolver` may be an object, but not a function.

DONE.
