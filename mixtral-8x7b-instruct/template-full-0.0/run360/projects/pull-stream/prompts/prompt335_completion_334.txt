 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would receive `null` as the data argument, instead of the original data value. This could cause issues if the code downstream is not expecting `null` and throws an error when it encounters it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && op(data) || data
```
This would result in different behavior because if `op` is falsy, the original data value would be returned instead of being passed through the `op` function. This could cause issues if the `op` function is expected to always be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the data value would be converted to a string before being passed to the `cb` function. This could cause issues if the downstream code is expecting a different data type and throws an error when it encounters a string.

DONE.
