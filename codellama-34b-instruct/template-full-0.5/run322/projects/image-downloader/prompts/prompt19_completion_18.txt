  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the `options.dest` path was not absolute, while this new code fragment checks if it is absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked if the `options.dest` path was not absolute, while this new code fragment checks if both the `options.dest` and `options.url` paths are not absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not check if the `options.url` path was absolute, while this new code fragment checks if both the `options.dest` and `options.url
