  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a different method than `array_slice`, and may return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `string_slice` is a different method than `array_slice`, and may return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
integer_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `integer_slice` is a different method than `array_slice`, and may return a different result.

DONE.
