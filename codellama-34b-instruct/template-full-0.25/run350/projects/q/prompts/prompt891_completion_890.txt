  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `args` variable is an array, and if it is, it will use the `args` variable as the arguments for the `nodeArgs` variable. If the `args` variable is not an array, it will use the `args` variable as the first argument for the `nodeArgs` variable, and the `args` variable will be the second argument. By replacing the `args` variable with `null`, the `nodeArgs` variable will always be an array with a single element, which is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `args` variable is an array, and if it is, it will use the `args` variable as the arguments for the `nodeArgs` variable. If the `args` variable is not an array, it will use the `args` variable as the first argument for the `nodeArgs` variable, and the `
