  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to `then` is reversed, causing the rejection handler to be called instead of the fulfillment handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because both the fulfillment and rejection handlers are replaced with `void 0`, causing the promise to never be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because both the fulfillment and rejection handlers are replaced with the same function, causing the promise to be rejected with the same reason as the original promise.

DONE.
