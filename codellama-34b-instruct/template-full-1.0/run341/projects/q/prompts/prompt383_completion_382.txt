  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the result of the `callback` Boolean expression. If `callback` was previously truthy, it would now be falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` operator is used to call a function. If `callback` was previously a function reference, it would now be called and return the result of that function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a function, and therefore cannot be called like one. If `callback` was previously a function reference, it would now be replaced with `null` and would not be callable.

DONE.
