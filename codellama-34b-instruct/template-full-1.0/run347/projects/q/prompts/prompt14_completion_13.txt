  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `ses` is an object and if it has an `ok` property, whereas replacing it with `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `ses.ok` is truthy, whereas replacing it with `false` would cause `ses.makeQ` to be undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello, world!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `makeQ` to be a function, whereas replacing it with a string would cause an error.

DONE.
