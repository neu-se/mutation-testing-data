 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the value at index 1 of the `ref` array is being multiplied by zero, effectively making it zero. The original code fragment returns the value at index 1 without any modifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the `ref` array and shifts all other elements to the left. The original code fragment returns the value at index 1, whereas this code fragment would return the value at index 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last element from the `ref` array. The original code fragment returns the value at index 1, whereas this code fragment would return the last element of the `ref` array.

DONE.
