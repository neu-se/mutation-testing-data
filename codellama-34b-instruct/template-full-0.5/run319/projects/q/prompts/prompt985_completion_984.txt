  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` would create a new function that is bound to `this`, but the original code `this.dispatch` is not bound to `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` would call `this.dispatch` with `this` as the context, but the original code `this.dispatch` does not have a context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this)` would call `this.dispatch` with `this` as the context, but the original code `this.dispatch` does not have a context.

DONE.
