  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` would delete the current item in the delta, rather than pushing a new item.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` would retain the current item in the delta, rather than pushing a new item.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.insert` would insert a new item into the delta, rather than pushing a new item.

DONE.
