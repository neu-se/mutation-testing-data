  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('src');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was selecting the `href` attribute of the current element, while the new code is selecting the `src` attribute, which may not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'http://example.com');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was selecting the `href` attribute of the current element, while the new code is changing the `href` attribute to a fixed value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', function () { return 'http://example.com'; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was selecting the `href` attribute of the current element, while the new code is changing the `href` attribute to a dynamically computed value.

DONE.
