  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable is not checked to be an object, which could lead to a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        error instanceof Error &&
        error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable is checked to be an instance of `Error`, which could result in a different outcome if the `error` variable is not an `Error` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable is not checked to be an object or an instance of `Error`, which could result in a type error or an unexpected outcome.

DONE.
