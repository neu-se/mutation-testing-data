 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, whereas `arguments` directly refers to the arguments object. This change may affect functions that rely on the mutability or identity of the arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of the enumerable property names of the arguments object, whereas `arguments` directly refers to the arguments object. This change may affect functions that rely on the direct access to the arguments object's properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.bind.apply(arguments.slice, [null, 1, 2])
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function bound to the context of `arguments` with the second and third arguments, whereas `arguments` directly refers to the arguments object. This change may
