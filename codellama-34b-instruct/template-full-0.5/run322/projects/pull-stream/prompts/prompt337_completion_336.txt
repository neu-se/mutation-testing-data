  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data, invert)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` argument is not passed to the `field` function, which could cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` argument is not passed to the `field` function, which could cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data, prop())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` function is not called with the correct arguments, which could cause the function to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
