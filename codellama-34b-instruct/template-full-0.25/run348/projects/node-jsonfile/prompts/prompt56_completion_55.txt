  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` replaces all occurrences of the search value, whereas `replace` only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace('\\n', EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only replace the first occurrence of the search value, whereas the original code replaces all occurrences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/\\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only replace the first occurrence of the search value, whereas the original code replaces all occurrences.

DONE.
