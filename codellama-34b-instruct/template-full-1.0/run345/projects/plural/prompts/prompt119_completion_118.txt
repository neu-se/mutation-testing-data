  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/igc$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will now match words that end with "igc", whereas the original regular expression only matches words that end with "ics".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics+/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will now match words that contain one or more "ics" anywhere in the word, whereas the original regular expression only matches words that end with "ics".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[cs]/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will now match words that contain either "c" or "s", whereas the original regular expression only matches words that end with "ics".

DONE.
