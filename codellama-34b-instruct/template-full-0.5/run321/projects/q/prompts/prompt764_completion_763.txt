  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `when` function with the `onProgress` callback, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress).then(function () {
    return promises[index];
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `then` method on the promise returned by `when`, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress).then(function () {
    return promises[index];
}, function () {
    return promises[index];
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `then` method on the promise returned by `when`, with
