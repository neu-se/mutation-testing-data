  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` method is used to retrieve a handler object for a given embed type, but replacing it with `null` would cause the `transform` method to return `null` instead of a new `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` method is used to retrieve a handler object for a given embed type, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `transform` method to return `undefined` instead of a new `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` method is used to retrieve a handler object for a given embed type, but replacing it with an empty object `{}` would cause the `transform` method to return an empty object instead of a new `Delta` object.

DONE.
