  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but the replacement code fragment `null` is not a function and does not take any arguments. This would cause the program to behave differently when the `terminate` function is called.

DONE.
