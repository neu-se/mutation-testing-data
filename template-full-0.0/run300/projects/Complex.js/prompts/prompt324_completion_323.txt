  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the variable `b` instead of the value of the variable `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of the values of the variables `a` and `b` instead of the value of the variable `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the values of the variables `a` and `b` instead of the value of the variable `a`.

DONE.
