  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This change will cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the keys in the database, but it will start from the second key instead of the first one. This may cause the method to skip over some keys and not apply the `fn` function to them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This change will cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the keys in the database, but it will start from the previous key instead of the current one. This may cause the method to apply the `fn` function to the same key multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + Math.random()
```
This change will cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the keys in the database, but it will start from a random key instead of the current one. This may cause the method to apply the `fn` function to different keys each time it is called.

DONE.
