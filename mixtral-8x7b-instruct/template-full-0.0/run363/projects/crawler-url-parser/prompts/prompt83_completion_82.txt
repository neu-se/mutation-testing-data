 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('body')
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects the `<body>` element instead of the current `<a>` element, potentially causing incorrect URL extraction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('a')[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the DOM element instead of using the jQuery object, potentially causing issues with chaining methods or incorrect URL extraction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('a').eq(i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a new jQuery object containing the selected element instead of using the original jQuery object, potentially causing issues with chaining methods or incorrect URL extraction.

DONE.
