  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(null, onRejected)` is a rejected promise, while `promise` is a pending promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(promise)` is a rejected promise, while `promise` is a pending promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve(promise)` is a fulfilled promise, while `promise` is a pending promise.

DONE.
