  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unique
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `unique` function, causing it to return `false` when the item is unique and `true` when it is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the items in the array, causing the first item to be returned when it is not unique.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array containing the items from the original array, starting from the second item. This would cause the first item to be returned when it is not unique.

DONE.
