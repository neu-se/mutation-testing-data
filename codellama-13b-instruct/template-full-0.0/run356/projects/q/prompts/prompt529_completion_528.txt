  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is called on the `Q` object, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is called on the `object` variable, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is called on the `Q` object, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
