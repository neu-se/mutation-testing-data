  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, generate()
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, generate()
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN, generate()
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
