  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with the given value, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with the given reason, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a new error object, whereas `Q.defer` would create a new deferred object without rejecting any promises.

DONE.
