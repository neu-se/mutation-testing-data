  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for the magnitude of a complex number is `a * a + 1`, not `a * a - 1`. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `a * a - 1`, the mutated code would calculate the wrong magnitude for complex numbers, potentially leading to floating-point errors or incorrect results in applications that rely on this code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for the magnitude of a complex number is `a * a + 1`, not `a + 1`. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `a + 1`, the mutated code would calculate the wrong magnitude for complex numbers, potentially leading to floating-point errors or incorrect results in applications that rely on this code.
