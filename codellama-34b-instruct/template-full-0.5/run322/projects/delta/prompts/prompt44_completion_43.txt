  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object or null, while this replacement checks if `a` is an object and not null. This would cause the code to throw an error if `a` is an object, even if it's not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null && typeof a === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object or null, while this replacement checks if `a` is not null and then checks if it's an object. This would cause the code to throw an error if `a` is null, even if it's an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a !== null && a.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not
