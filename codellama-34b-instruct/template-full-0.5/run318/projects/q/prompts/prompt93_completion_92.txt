  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is an integer, while `1 + 1` is an expression that evaluates to the integer `2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is an integer, while `"hello"` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is an integer, while `null` is a null value.

DONE.
