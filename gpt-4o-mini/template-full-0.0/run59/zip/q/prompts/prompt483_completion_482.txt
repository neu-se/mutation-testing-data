Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the one corresponding to the promise being untracked, potentially leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to remove the next element in the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the correct one, which could lead to mismatches between the reasons and the promises being tracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the first element of the `unhandledReasons` array, regardless of which promise is being untracked, leading to a loss of information about the actual reason for the rejection.

DONE.
