  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race(Ladder)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race` is a function that returns a promise for the first of an array of promises to become settled, while `Ladder` is an undefined variable. The resulting promise would thus be rejected with a `TypeError` exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.crater(Ladder)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.crater` is not a function, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Ladder.race(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Ladder` is an undefined variable, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` exception.

DONE.
