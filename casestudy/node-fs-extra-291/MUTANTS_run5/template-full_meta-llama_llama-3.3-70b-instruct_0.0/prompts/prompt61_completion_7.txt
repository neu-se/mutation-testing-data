Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'', ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not escape the '$' character, potentially leading to incorrect replacement in the `replace()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$', '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only escape the '$' character once, instead of twice, potentially leading to incorrect replacement in the `replace()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'_', '__'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all occurrences of '_' with '__' instead of escaping '$' characters, potentially leading to incorrect file paths.

DONE.
