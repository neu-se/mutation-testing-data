  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min()` will return the minimum value of `a` and `b`, whereas `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of its argument, which may be different if the argument is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max()` will return the maximum value of `a` and `b`, whereas `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of its argument, which may be different if the argument is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of its argument, which is always greater than or equal to 0.

DONE.
