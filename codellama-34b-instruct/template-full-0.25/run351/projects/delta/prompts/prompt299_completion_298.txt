  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.slice(0, 1)` would return the first character of the line, while `line` would return the entire line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.slice(1, 2)` would return the second character of the line, while `line` would return the entire line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.slice(0, 2)` would return the first two characters of the line, while `line` would return the entire line.

DONE.
