  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to replace the entire path with a single slash, rather than just the last part of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/" + linkurl_path.replace(/\/[^\/]+\.[a-z]+$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to replace the entire path with a single slash, followed by the path without the last part of the path, rather than just the last part of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/[^\/]+\.[a-z]+$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to replace the entire path with the path without the last part of the path, rather than just the last part of the path.

DONE.
