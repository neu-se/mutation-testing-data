 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'^\\/\\/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslashes are escaped with another backslash, making it a literal string instead of a regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'^//'
```
This would result in different behavior because the caret is moved outside the square brackets, changing the meaning of the regex pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'^/\\/'
