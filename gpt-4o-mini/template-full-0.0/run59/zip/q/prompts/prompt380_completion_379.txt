Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Promise instance instead of using the Q library's promise implementation, potentially leading to different handling of promise states and behaviors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with an undefined reason, bypassing the original promise's resolution and potentially causing unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with an undefined value, which could lead to unexpected results in the promise chain, especially if the original promise was meant to handle specific values.

DONE.
