  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `includes()`, which checks for the presence of a substring, while the new code uses `indexOf()`, which checks for the presence of a substring and returns the substring's index in the original string. If the substring is not present, `indexOf()` will return -1, while `includes()` will return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the link URL path includes the page URL path, while the new code checks if the link URL path starts with the page URL path. If the link URL path starts with the page URL path, the new code will return true, while the original code may return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.includes(linkurl_path)
```
This would
