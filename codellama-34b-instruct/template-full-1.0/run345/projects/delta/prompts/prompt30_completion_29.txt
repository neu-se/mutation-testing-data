  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] === attr[key] && attr[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code fragment, causing the invert function to return the opposite result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] == base[key] && attr[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `==` operator instead of the `===` operator, which could cause the invert function to behave differently for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the invert function to return `undefined` if the value of `attr[key]` is `undefined`, even if the value of `base[key]` is different.

DONE.
