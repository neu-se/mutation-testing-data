  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(value)` will resolve the promise with the value, while the original code fragment `deferred.reject(error)` will reject the promise with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject(error)` will reject the promise with the error, while the original code fragment `deferred.resolve(value)` will resolve the promise with the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Intentional failure"));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject(new Error("Intentional failure"))` will reject the promise with a new error, while the original code fragment `deferred.resolve(value)` will resolve the promise with the value.

DONE.
