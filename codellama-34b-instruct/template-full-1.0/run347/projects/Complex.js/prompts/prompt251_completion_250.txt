  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `b` is doubled, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `b` is incremented by 1, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `b` is negated, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
