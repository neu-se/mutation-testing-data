  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at `i=1` instead of `i=0`, causing the first element of the `arguments` array to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at `i=2` instead of `i=0`, causing the first two elements of the `arguments` array to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at `i=length-1` instead of `i=0`, causing the last element of the `arguments` array to be skipped.

DONE.
