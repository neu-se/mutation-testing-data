  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would not be called on the `Promise` object, which would cause the `del` method to return a promise that is resolved with `undefined` instead of the expected return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method is not defined on the `Promise` object, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown when the `del` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on the `Promise` object, but the `this` value would be bound to the `Promise` object instead of the `del` method, which would cause the `del` method to return a promise that is resolved with the wrong value.

DONE.
