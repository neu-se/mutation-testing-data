  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options.encoding)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is not being applied properly, and the file will be written with the wrong encoding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is not being passed to `fs.writeFileSync`, and the file will be written with the default options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options.encoding || 'utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is not being applied properly, and the file will be written with the wrong encoding.

DONE.
