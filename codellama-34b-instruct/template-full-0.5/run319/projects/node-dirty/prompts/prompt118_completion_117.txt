  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'read_close'` event when the read stream is closed, while the modified code would emit a `'read_error'` event, which may not be handled by the application and could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'read_close'` event when the read stream is closed, while the modified code would emit a `'write_error'` event, which may not be handled by the application and could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'read_close'` event when the read stream is closed, while the modified code would emit an `'error'` event, which may not be handled by the application and could result in unexpected behavior.

DONE.
