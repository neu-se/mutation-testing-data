  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.set(key)}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key in the `_data` object to `undefined`, instead of getting the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) + 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of the key in the `_data` object, instead of just getting the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) * 2}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of the key in the `_data` object by 2, instead of just getting the value.

DONE.
