  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `array_map` returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` applies a function to each element in the array and returns a single value, while `array_map` returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_some
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_some` returns `true` if at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function, while `array_map` returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array.

DONE.
