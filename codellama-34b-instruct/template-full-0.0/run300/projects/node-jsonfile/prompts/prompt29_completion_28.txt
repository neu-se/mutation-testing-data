  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + 'bug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the added string `'bug'` would cause the resulting JSON string to be invalid, which would cause the `JSON.parse` call to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + '}'
```
This would result in different behavior because the added string `'}'` would cause the resulting JSON string to be invalid, which would cause the `JSON.parse` call to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + '}' + 'bug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the added string `'}' + 'bug'` would cause the resulting JSON string to be invalid, which would cause the `JSON.parse` call to throw an error.

DONE.
