  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only extract the first word of the text, rather than the entire text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").slice(1).join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only extract the text after the first word, rather than the entire text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").slice(0, -1).join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only extract the text before the last word, rather than the entire text.

DONE.
