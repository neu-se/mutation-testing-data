  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.warn` is a different function than `console.log`, and it may not have the same behavior or functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` is a different function than `console.log`, and it may not have the same behavior or functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.info` is a different function than `console.log`, and it may not have the same behavior or functionality.

DONE.
