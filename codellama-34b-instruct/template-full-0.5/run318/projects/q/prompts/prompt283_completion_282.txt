  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `array_slice` method is not the same as the first argument, which is the array to be sliced.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `array_slice` method is not the same as the first two arguments, which are the array to be sliced and the index at which to start slicing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument of the `array_slice` method is not the same as the first three arguments, which are the array to be sliced, the index at which to start slicing, and the index at which to end slicing.

DONE.
