  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.bind(null, 'unhandledRejection', reason, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the `emit` method with the given arguments, rather than passing a function to run after the next tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.call(null, 'unhandledRejection', reason, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the `emit` method with the given arguments, rather than passing a function to run after the next tick.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.apply(null, ['unhandledRejection', reason, promise])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the `emit` method with the given arguments, rather than passing a function to run after the next tick.

DONE.
