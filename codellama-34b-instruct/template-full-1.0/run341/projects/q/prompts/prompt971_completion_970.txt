  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"placeholder"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `args` which is an array, but the new fragment is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `args` which is an array, but the new fragment is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `args` which is an array, but the new fragment is `undefined`.

DONE.
