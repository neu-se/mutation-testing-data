  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable is used to calculate the index of the newline character in the string, and adding 1 to it would cause the index to be off by 1, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable is used to calculate the index of the newline character in the string, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the index to be off by -1, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable is used to calculate the index of the newline character in the string, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the index to be off by a factor of 2, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
