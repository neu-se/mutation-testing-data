  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `this` to refer to the global object, instead of the `defer` function being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned value to always be a promise that is already resolved with the given value, instead of a new pending promise that can be resolved or rejected later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned value to always be a rejected promise, instead of a new pending promise that can be resolved or rejected later.

DONE.
