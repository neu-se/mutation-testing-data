  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function is no longer being called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function is no longer being called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function is no longer being called with the correct arguments.

DONE.
