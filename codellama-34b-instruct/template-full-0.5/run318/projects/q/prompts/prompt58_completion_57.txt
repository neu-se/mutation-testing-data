  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would assume that `setImmediate` is not a function, even if it is available in the environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would assume that `setImmediate` is not defined, even if it is available in the environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would assume that `setImmediate` is an object, even if it is a function in the environment.

DONE.
