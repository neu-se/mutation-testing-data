  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while the new code fragment checks if it is a string. This would cause the `push` method to behave differently when `lastOp` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while the new code fragment checks if it is undefined. This would cause the `push` method to behave differently when `lastOp` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while the new code fragment checks if it is a function. This would cause the `push` method to behave differently when `lastOp` is a function.
