  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return an empty array, which is not the same as the original behavior where the method would return an array containing all the arguments starting from the 2nd argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would contain the `name` argument, which is not the same as the original behavior where the array would contain the 1st argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would contain `undefined`, which is not the same as the original behavior where the array would contain the 1st argument.

DONE.
