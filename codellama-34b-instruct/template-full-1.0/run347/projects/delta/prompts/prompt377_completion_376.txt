  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next value in the iteration, whereas `peekType()` only returns the type of the next value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` returns a boolean indicating whether there are more values in the iteration, whereas `peekType()` returns the type of the next value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because `length()` returns the number of values in the iteration, whereas `peekType()` only returns the type of the next value.

DONE.
