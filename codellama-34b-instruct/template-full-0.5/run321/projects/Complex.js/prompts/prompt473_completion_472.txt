  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im']` refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `this['re']` refers to the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re'] + this['im']` would return the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while `this['re']` returns only the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re'] * this['im']` would return the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while `this['re']` returns only the real part.

DONE.
