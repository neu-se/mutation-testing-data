  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a function that checks if an object is a promise-like object, which is different from `isPromise` which checks if an object is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise` would check if an object is not a promise, which is different from `isPromise` which checks if an object is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` checks if an object is a fulfilled promise, which is different from `isPromise` which checks if an object is a promise.

DONE.
