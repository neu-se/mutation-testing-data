  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.missingKey
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` object does not have a `missingKey` property, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` instead of returning the `object` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.valueOf()` returns the object itself, so the code would return the `object` object instead of throwing a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access its properties instead of returning the `object` object.

DONE.
