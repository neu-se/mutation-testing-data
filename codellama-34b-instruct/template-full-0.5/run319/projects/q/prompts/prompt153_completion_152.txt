  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that returns a new array with the concatenated elements of the original array, whereas `join` is a method that returns a string with the elements of the array separated by a specified separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method that adds one or more elements to the end of an array, whereas `join` is a method that returns a string with the elements of the array separated by a specified separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a method that removes the last element of an array and returns that element, whereas `join` is a method that returns a string with the elements of the array separated by a specified separator.

DONE.
