  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the stack trace, which may not include the desired information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second part of the stack trace, which may not include the desired information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the third part of the stack trace, which may not include the desired information.

DONE.
