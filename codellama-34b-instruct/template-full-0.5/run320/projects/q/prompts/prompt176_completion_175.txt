  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be concatenated without any separation, making it difficult to read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with a tab character, which may not be appropriate for all use cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<br>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with a HTML line break, which may not be appropriate for all use cases.

DONE.
