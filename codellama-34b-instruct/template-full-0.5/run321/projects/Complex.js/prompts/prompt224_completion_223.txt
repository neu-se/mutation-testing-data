  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a >= 0` includes the case where `a` is equal to zero, while the new code fragment `a > 0` excludes this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a >= 0` includes the case where `a` is equal to zero, while the new code fragment `a != 0` excludes this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a >= 0` checks if `a` is greater than or equal to zero, while the new code fragment `a * a >= 0` checks if `a` squared is greater than or equal to zero, which is a different condition.

DONE.
