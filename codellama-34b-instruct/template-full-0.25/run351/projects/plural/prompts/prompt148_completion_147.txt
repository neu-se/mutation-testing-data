  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement would convert the word to lowercase before applying the pluralization rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement would return the length of the word instead of the pluralized form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement would split the word into an array of individual characters instead of applying the pluralization rules.

DONE.
