 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` calculates the cosine of a number in radians, while `cosh` calculates the hyperbolic cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` calculates the base of the natural logarithm (e) raised to the power of a number, while `cosh` calculates the hyperbolic cosine of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 / Math.sin` calculates the reciprocal of the sine of a number, while `cosh` calculates the hyperbolic cosine of a number.

DONE.
