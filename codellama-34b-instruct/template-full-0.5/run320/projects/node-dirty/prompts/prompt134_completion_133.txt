  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `JSON.stringify` method to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `JSON.stringify` method to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + key
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is concatenated with the string "key", which would cause the `JSON.stringify` method to produce a different output.

DONE.
