  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the `extractFilename` variable, which is used to determine whether the filename should be extracted from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of the value of `extractFilename`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename || false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `extractFilename`.

DONE.
