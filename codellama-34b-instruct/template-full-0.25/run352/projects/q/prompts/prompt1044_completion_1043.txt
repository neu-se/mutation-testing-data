  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the "tail" property of the promise, rather than the "head" property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head").then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the "head" property of the promise, but would also add a then() method to the returned value, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head").catch(function(error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the "head" property of the promise, but would also add a catch() method to the returned value, which would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
