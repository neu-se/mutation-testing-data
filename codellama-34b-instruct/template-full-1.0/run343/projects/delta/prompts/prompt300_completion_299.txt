  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.next(2)` method is called instead of `.next(1)`, which changes the number of characters consumed from the current iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.next(-1)` method is called instead of `.next(1)`, which changes the direction of iteration from forward to backward.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.next(0)` method is called instead of `.next(1)`, which does not consume any characters from the current iterator.

DONE.
