  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because an unhandled error would be thrown, causing the program to terminate with an error message. In contrast, the original code fragment called the `Q.onerror` function, which would execute any error handlers that had been registered with the `Q` instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(promise)[0].throw();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly throw an error from the promise, whereas the original code fragment simply called the `reject` method on the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.throw();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly throw an error from the promise, whereas the original code fragment simply called the `reject` method on the promise.

DONE.
