  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would now decrease the value of `i` instead of increasing it, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would now increase the value of `i` by 2 on each iteration, potentially causing the loop to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would now increase the value of `i` by a factor of 2 on each iteration, potentially causing the loop to skip over certain elements in the array.

DONE.
