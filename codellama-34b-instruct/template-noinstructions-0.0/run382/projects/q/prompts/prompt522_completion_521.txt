  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the exception if the promise is rejected, while this new code fragment would throw the exception regardless of whether the promise is rejected or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns a rejected promise if the promise is rejected, while this new code fragment would return a rejected promise regardless of whether the promise is rejected or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns a promise for the exception if the promise is rejected, while this new code fragment would return a promise for the exception regardless of whether the promise is rejected or not.

DONE.
