Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the URL in the map instead of retrieving the associated value, which would lead to a logical error in the subsequent code that expects to manipulate the retrieved object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl.url + 'wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to retrieve a value using a modified key that does not exist in the map, resulting in `undefined` instead of the expected object, which would cause an error when trying to access properties on `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the length of the `text` property directly instead of the object itself, which would lead to a type error if `currentUrl.url` is not found in the map, as it would attempt to access `length` on `undefined`.

DONE.
