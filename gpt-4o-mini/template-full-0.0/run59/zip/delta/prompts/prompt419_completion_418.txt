Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat insert operations as if they were delete operations, potentially leading to incorrect index calculations and transformations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow all types except delete to be processed, which could lead to unintended transformations and incorrect handling of delete operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over delete operations entirely, causing the index to be adjusted incorrectly and potentially omitting necessary transformations for delete operations.

DONE.
