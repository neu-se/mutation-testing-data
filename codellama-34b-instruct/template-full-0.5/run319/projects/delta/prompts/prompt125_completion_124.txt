  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.peek();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is not defined for the `OpIterator` class, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method advances the iterator and returns the next value, rather than just returning the next value without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.peek();
if (firstOther != null) {
  otherIter.next();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next value without advancing the iterator, but the `next` method is called unconditionally, which could result in the iterator advancing beyond the end of the iterable.

DONE.
