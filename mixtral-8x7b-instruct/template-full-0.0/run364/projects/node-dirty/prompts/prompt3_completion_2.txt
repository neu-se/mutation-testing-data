 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` performs type coercion, allowing values like `null` and empty strings to be considered equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a common way to represent `undefined`, but it is not exactly the same as the `undefined` keyword, and could potentially lead to different behavior in some edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `undefined`, and this change would cause the function to only delete keys with a value of `null`.

DONE.
