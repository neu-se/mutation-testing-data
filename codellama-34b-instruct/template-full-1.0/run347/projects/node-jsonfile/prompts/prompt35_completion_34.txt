  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `str === ''` expression returns a boolean value indicating whether `str` is an empty string, while the original `str` expression returns a string value. This change would cause the `writeFile` function to behave differently when the function is called with an empty string as the `obj` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof str === 'object' && str !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof str === 'object' && str !== null` expression returns a boolean value indicating whether `str` is a non-null object, while the original `str` expression returns a string value. This change would cause the `writeFile` function to behave differently when the function is called with a non-string object as the `obj` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` expression returns a null value, while the
