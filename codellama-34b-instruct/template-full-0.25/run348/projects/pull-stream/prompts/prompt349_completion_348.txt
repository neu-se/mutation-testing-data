  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a simple variable reference, while `data + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a simple variable reference, while `data.length` is an expression that returns the length of the `data` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a simple variable reference, while `data[0]` is an expression that returns the first element of the `data` array.

DONE.
