  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request timed out.')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `TimeoutError` class is not being used, and the error message is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request failed.')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different, and the `TimeoutError` class is not being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request timed out.', { code: 'ETIMEDOUT' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different, and the `code` property is set to a different value.

DONE.
