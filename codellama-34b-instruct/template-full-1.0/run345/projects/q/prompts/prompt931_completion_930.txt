  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.npost
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.npost` is a different function from `Q.denodeify`, and it may not have the same behavior or functionality as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.napply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.napply` is a different function from `Q.denodeify`, and it may not have the same behavior or functionality as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nmcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nmcall` is a different function from `Q.denodeify`, and it may not have the same behavior or functionality as the original code.

DONE.
