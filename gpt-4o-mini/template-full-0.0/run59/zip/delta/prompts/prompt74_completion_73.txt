Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` method to return the current instance of `Delta` without pushing the new operation to the `ops` array, effectively ignoring the `retain` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `attributes` of the new operation to `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior when the `push` method checks for equality of attributes, potentially merging operations incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the new operation to the end of the `ops` array, ignoring any logic that determines the correct position based on the type of the last operation, which could disrupt the intended order of operations.

DONE.
