 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(promises) === '[object Array]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the object's internal `[[Class]]` property instead of the `length` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the object's prototype chain instead of the `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Array.isArray` function, which is a more reliable way to check if an object is an array. However, it might not be supported in older browsers.

DONE.
