  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the method to be called with the arguments in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array, which would cause the method to be called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.concat([1])]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method concatenates the elements of the array with the elements of another array, which would cause the method to be called with an additional argument.

DONE.
