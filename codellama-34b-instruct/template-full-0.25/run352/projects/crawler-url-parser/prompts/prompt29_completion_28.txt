  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would return a new string that is a subset of the original string, starting from the second character. In the original code, the `replace` method is used to replace the first character of the string with an empty string, effectively removing the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a new string that is a subset of the original string, starting from the second character and ending at the end of the string. In the original code, the `replace` method is used to replace the first character of the string with an empty string, effectively removing the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substr method would return a new string that is a subset of the original string, starting from the second
