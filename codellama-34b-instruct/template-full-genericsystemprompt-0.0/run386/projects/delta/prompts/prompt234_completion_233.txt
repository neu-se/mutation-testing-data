  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `push` are different methods of the `Delta` class, and they have different effects on the delta's internal state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `push` have different effects on the delta's internal state, and `retain(0)` would not have the same effect as `push` in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` and `push` have different effects on the delta's internal state, and `delete(0)` would not have the same effect as `push` in this context.

DONE.
