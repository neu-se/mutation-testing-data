  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is expected to take two arguments: `err` and `data`. Returning `null, null` would result in both `err` and `data` being `null`, which could cause the program to behave differently or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`. The `undefined` value represents the absence of any value, and using it in place of `null` could cause the program to behave differently or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb("Error", null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is expected to take two arguments: `err` and `data`. Returning a string value `"Error"` for the `err` argument would cause the program to behave differently or produce incorrect results.
