 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be logged to the console instead of emitting an 'error' event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would not be handled and the callback would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of emitting an 'error' event, the corrupted row would be added to the internal data structure.

DONE.
