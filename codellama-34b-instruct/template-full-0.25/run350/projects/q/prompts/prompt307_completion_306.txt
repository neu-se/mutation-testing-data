  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value returned by the `then` method, rather than the value returned by the `join` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(reject, resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the value returned by the `then` method, rather than the value returned by the `join` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value returned by the `then` method, rather than the value returned by the `join` method.

DONE.
