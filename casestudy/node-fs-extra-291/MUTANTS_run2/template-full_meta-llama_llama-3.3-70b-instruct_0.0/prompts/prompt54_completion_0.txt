Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.join(targetPath, path.basename(file.name))
```
This would result in different behavior because it constructs the target path by joining the target directory with the base name of the file, rather than replacing the source path with the target path in the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file.name + targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the file name with the target path, rather than replacing the source path with the target path, potentially resulting in an incorrect target path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.resolve(basePath, file.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the file name to an absolute path based on the base path, rather than replacing the source path with the target path, potentially resulting in a different target path than intended.

DONE.
