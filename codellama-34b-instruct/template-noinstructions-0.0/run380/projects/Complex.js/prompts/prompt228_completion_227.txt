  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2 * (r - a))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.sqrt(2 * (r + a))` which is the correct formula for the complex square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2 * (r + a))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.sqrt(2 * (r - a))` which is the correct formula for the complex square root.

```
Math.sqrt(2 * (r + a))

DONE.
