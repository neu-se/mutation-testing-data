Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.thenResolve` function to attempt to resolve `null` instead of the original promise, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to resolve a value that is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` to the `Q.thenResolve` function, which may lead to errors or unexpected results when the promise is resolved, as it would not be a valid promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string literal instead of a promise, causing the `thenResolve` method to treat the string as a resolved value, which could lead to incorrect handling of promise resolution in the subsequent chain.

DONE.
