  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue == promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, causing the `promise` to be resolved recursively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(nearerValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original condition, causing the `promise` to be rejected if `nearerValue` is not a promise, and resolved if it is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `nearerValue` is a promise that is pending, and would cause the `promise` to be resolved or rejected accordingly.

DONE.
