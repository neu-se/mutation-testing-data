  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the `op.delete` property, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `op.delete`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would check for strict equality between `op.delete` and `true`, causing the `if` statement to only evaluate to `true` if `op.delete` is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would check for strict inequality between `op.delete` and `false`, causing the `if` statement to only evaluate to `true` if `op.delete` is strictly unequal to `false`.

DONE.
