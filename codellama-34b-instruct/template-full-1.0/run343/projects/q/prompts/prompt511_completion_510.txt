  Sure, I can do that! Here are my three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the "this" value passed to the "apply" method would be the value of the promise, rather than the global object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the "this" value passed to the "apply" method would be null, rather than the global object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the "this" value passed to the "apply" method would be undefined, rather than the global object.

DONE.
