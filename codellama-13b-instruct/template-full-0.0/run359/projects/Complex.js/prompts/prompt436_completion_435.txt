  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `floor` method would return a different value when the `places` argument is not 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `floor` method would return a different value when the `places` argument is not 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `floor` method would return a different value when the `places` argument is not 0.

DONE.
