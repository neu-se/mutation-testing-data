  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deleteUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `deleteUnhandledRejections` is not a known method in the code snippet, whereas `resetUnhandledRejections` is a method defined in the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would not track unhandled rejections, whereas the original code would continue to track unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections` is a variable defined in the code snippet, and assigning it a value of `null` would cause a null reference exception when the code attempts to access the `unhandledRejections` variable.

DONE.
