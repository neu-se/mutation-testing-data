  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This change will cause the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant to be initialized to the character with ASCII value 1, which is the start of heading (SOH) control character. This may cause issues in the `diff()` function if it is used to compare strings that contain this character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This change will cause the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant to be initialized to the character with ASCII value -1, which is the delete (DEL) control character. This may cause issues in the `diff()` function if it is used to compare strings that contain this character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This change will cause the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant to be initialized to a space character. This may cause issues in the `diff()` function if it is used to compare strings that contain spaces.

DONE.
