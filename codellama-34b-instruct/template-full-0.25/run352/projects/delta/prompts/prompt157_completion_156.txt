  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this modified code fragment checks if it is not an insert. This would cause the `compose` method to behave differently when the next operation in the other iterator is not an insert.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator has a non-zero length, while this modified code fragment checks if the length is greater than zero. This would cause the `compose` method to behave differently when the next operation in the other iterator has a length of zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert
