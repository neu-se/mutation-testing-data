  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `window` or `self` is defined, while this new code fragment checks if both are defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined" || typeof self === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `window` or `self` is defined, while this new code fragment checks if neither is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined" && typeof self === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `window` or `self` is defined, while this new code fragment checks if neither is defined.

DONE.
