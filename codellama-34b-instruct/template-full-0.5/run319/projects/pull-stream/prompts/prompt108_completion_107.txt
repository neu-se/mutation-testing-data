  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (!) to check if cb is falsy, while this code fragment uses the strict equality operator (===) to check if cb is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (!) to check if cb is falsy, while this code fragment uses the strict equality operator (===) to check if acc is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (!) to check if cb is falsy, while this code fragment uses the strict equality operator (===) to check if sink is null.

DONE.
