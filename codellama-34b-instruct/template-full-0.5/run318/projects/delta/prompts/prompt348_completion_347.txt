  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opData` and `baseOpData` values would be swapped, which could cause the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opData` and `baseOpData` values would be added together, which could cause the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData * baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opData` and `baseOpData` values would be multiplied together, which could cause the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
