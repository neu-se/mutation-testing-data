  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is called twice, which could cause the file streams to be closed prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('close')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted twice, which could cause the file streams to be closed prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is called twice, which could cause the file streams to be closed prematurely.

DONE.
