  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromObject` method to use the wrong property name, leading to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromObject` method to use a different property name, leading to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' - '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromObject` method to use a different property name, leading to an error.

DONE.
