 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
progressListeners = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because it resets the progress listeners, causing the `notify` method to have no effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
progressListeners = {push: function() {}};
