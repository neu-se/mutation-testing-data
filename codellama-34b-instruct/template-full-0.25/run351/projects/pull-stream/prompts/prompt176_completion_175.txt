  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `array` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `array.length` property, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `array` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `array[0]` element, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `array` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `array[i]` element, which is a different value.

DONE.
