 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection of the promise is replaced with its resolution, potentially causing tests to pass even when the code should have rejected the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection function is replaced with an empty function, which would not reject the promise, causing tests to pass even when the code should have rejected the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection of the promise is replaced with a progress notification, which would not indicate a failure to the test suite, causing tests to pass even when the code should have rejected the promise.

DONE.
