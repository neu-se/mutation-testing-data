  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first line of the stack trace, which may be important for debugging purposes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first two lines of the stack trace, which may be important for debugging purposes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 3);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first three lines of the stack trace, which may be important for debugging purposes.

DONE.
