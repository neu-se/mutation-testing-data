Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.open
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.open` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise or uses a callback, whereas `this.openSync` is a synchronous function that returns the file descriptor immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.openSync.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind(null)` changes the context of the `openSync` function to the global object, potentially affecting how it behaves if it relies on its `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename => this.openSync(filename, 'w')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the file mode from 'r' to 'w', potentially overwriting the file instead of just reading it.

DONE.
