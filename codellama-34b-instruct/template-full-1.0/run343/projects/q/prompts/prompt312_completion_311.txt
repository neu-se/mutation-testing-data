  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the first promise in the array, instead of checking all of them as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the length of the array, instead of checking the fulfillment of each promise in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the index variable `i` before using it to access the next promise in the array, instead of using the same index for all promises.

DONE.
