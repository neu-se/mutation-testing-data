  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a number in the original code, but we are checking if it is null in the replaced line. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to true when it should be false, and the code inside the `if` block would be executed even though it shouldn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a number in the original code, but we are checking if it is NaN in the replaced line. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to true when it should be false, and the code inside the `if` block would be executed even though it shouldn't.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a number
