  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to consider insert operations instead of delete operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to consider retain operations instead of delete operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain' && thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to consider retain operations with a length greater than 0 instead of delete operations.

DONE.
