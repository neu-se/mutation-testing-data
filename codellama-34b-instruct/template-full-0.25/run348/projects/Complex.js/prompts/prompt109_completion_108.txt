  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, while the `!isNaN` function checks if a value is not NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks if a value is a finite number, while the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, while the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN.

DONE.
