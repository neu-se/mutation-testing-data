  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, so if `cb` is truthy, it will become falsy, and if `cb` is falsy, it will become truthy. This could cause the function to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will return the second operand if the first operand is truthy, and `null` is a falsy value. This could cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will return the first operand if it is truthy, and `null` is a falsy value. This could cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected value.
