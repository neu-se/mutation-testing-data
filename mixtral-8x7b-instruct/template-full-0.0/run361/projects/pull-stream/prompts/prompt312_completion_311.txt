 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would terminate the entire Node.js process instead of just calling the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the second argument to the callback instead of the actual data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(ended, cb)
