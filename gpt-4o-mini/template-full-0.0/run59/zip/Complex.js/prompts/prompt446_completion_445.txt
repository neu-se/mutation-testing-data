Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` always rounds down to the nearest integer, while `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer based on the fractional part, potentially leading to different results for values that are not whole numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(this['re'] * places) / places
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Math.ceil` instead of `Math.round` will always round up to the nearest integer, which can significantly alter the output for values that are not whole numbers, especially when the fractional part is less than 0.5.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because omitting the rounding entirely will return the raw product of `this['re'] * places`, which can lead to non-integer values being returned instead of the rounded result, thus changing the intended output of the function.

DONE.
