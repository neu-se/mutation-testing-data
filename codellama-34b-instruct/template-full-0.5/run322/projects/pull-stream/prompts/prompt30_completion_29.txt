  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[3]` is a different element in the `ref` array than `ref[2]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[2] + 1` would be a different value than `ref[2]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.length` is a different value than `ref[2]`.

DONE.
