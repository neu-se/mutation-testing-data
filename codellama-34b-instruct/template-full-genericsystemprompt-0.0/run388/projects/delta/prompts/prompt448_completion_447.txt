  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a property that is not defined in the `Op` class, and it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a property that is not defined in the `Op` class, and it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a property that is not defined in the `Op` class, and it would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
