  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseUrlStr` parameter to the `parse` function, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass the `baseUrlStr` parameter to the `parse` function, which is present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr, embedBaseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `embedBaseUrlStr` parameter to the `parse` function twice, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
