  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, and adding 1 to it would change its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, and multiplying it by 2 would change its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, and subtracting 1 from it would change its value.

DONE.
