  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and not equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and not equal to `false`. This change would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `end` is a non-boolean value, such as `0` or `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and not equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and not equal to `null`. This change would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `end` is a non-null object, such as an empty object or an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if
