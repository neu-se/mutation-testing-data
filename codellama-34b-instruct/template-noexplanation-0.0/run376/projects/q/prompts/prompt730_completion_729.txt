  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This change will cause the `all` function to reject the promise instead of notifying it, which will result in different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This change will cause the `all` function to resolve the promise instead of notifying it, which will result in different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify({ index: index, value: progress })
```
This change will cause the `all` function to notify the promise with a different value than the original code, which will result in different behavior.

DONE.
