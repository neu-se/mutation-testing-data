  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different string representation of the complex number, which may cause issues with the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different string representation of the complex number, which may cause issues with the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== Infinity
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different string representation of the complex number, which may cause issues with the test suite.

DONE.
