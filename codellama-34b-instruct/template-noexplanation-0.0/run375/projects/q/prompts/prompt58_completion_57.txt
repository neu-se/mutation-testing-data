  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate !== "function"
```
This change will cause the `else if` block to be executed, which sets `requestTick` to `setImmediate.bind(window, flush)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate === "undefined"
```
This change will cause the `else if` block to be executed, which sets `requestTick` to `setImmediate.bind(window, flush)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate === "object"
```
This change will cause the `else if` block to be executed, which sets `requestTick` to `setImmediate.bind(window, flush)`.

DONE.
