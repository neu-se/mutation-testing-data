  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would receive `undefined` as the initial value, which would cause it to skip over the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would receive `null` as the initial value, which would cause it to skip over the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would receive the current object as the initial value, which would cause it to include the current object in the reduced value.

DONE.
