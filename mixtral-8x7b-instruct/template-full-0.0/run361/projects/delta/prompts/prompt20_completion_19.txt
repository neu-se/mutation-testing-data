 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(<any>b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it may cause a runtime error when `b` is not an object. The original code assumes `b` to be an object, but this change would allow `b` to be any value, causing a possible type assertion error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert `b` to a string, which would then be concatenated with the keys of `a`. The original code simply concatenates the keys of `a` and `b` as arrays, but this change would result in a different data type, causing unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b || []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array if `b` is falsy. The original code returns `undefined` if `b` is fals
