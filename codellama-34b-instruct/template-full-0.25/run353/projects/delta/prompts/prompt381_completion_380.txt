  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over the next iteration of the `otherIter` loop, potentially missing a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over two iterations of the `otherIter` loop, potentially missing necessary operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over the entire `otherIter` loop, potentially missing necessary operations.

DONE.
