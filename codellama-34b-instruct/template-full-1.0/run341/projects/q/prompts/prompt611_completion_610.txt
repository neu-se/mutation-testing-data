  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `get` operation is performed on the provided object, but in the modified code, the `set` operation is performed, which would result in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the operation is performed on the provided object, but in the modified code, the operation is performed on `void 0`, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the operation is performed on the provided object, but in the modified code, the operation is performed on an empty object, which would result in the return value being undefined.

DONE.
