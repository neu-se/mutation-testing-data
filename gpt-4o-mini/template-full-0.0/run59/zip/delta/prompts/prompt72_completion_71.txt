Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `newOp.attributes` has any keys instead of checking if `attributes` has any keys, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when `newOp.attributes` is defined but empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `newOp` to be created even when `attributes` is explicitly set to `null`, which would bypass the intended check for an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the condition to pass even when `attributes` is an empty object, which is not the intended logic since it should only proceed if `attributes` has keys.

DONE.
