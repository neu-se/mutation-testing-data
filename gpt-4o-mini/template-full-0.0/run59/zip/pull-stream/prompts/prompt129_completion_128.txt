Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument passed to the callback from `null` to `false`, which may alter how the callback handles the response, potentially leading to incorrect processing of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` before passing it to the callback, which means the value of `i` sent to the callback will always be one greater than the current value, potentially causing off-by-one errors in the logic that relies on the value of `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value of `i` by multiplying it by 2 before passing it to the callback, which could lead to unexpected results if the callback is designed to handle the original value of `i` directly.

DONE.
