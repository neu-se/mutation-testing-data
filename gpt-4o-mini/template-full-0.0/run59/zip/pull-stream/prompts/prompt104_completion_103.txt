Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(null, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an asynchronous delay in the execution, which may cause the `done` callback to be called after a delay, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in tests that expect immediate execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(42, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument passed to the `drain` function from `null` to `42`, which may cause the function to behave differently if it expects a specific type or value for its first parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(undefined, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument from `null` to `undefined`, which may lead to different handling within the `drain` function if it has specific checks or logic for `null` versus `undefined`.

DONE.
