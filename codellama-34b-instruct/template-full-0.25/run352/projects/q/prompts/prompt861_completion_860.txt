  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` would always be truthy, even if it was not provided as an argument to `Q.delay`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` would be falsy if it was not provided as an argument to `Q.delay`, but it would also be falsy if it was explicitly set to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` would be falsy if it was not provided as an argument to `Q.delay`, but it would also be falsy if it was explicitly set to `undefined`.

DONE.
