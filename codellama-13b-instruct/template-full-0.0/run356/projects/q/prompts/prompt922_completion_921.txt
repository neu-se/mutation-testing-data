  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` statement would be replaced with `deferred.resolve`, which would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it. This could potentially cause the test to pass when it should fail, which could indicate that the test suite is not effective in detecting the presence of bugs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` statement would be replaced with `deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"))`, which would reject the promise with a custom error message. This could potentially cause the test to fail with a different error message than the one that was expected, which could indicate that the test suite is not effective in detecting the presence of bugs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred
