  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance * 2, bearing
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to calculate the destination point using a distance that is twice the original distance, which will result in a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing + 180
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to calculate the destination point using a bearing that is 180 degrees different from the original bearing, which will result in a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing * 2
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to calculate the destination point using a bearing that is twice the original bearing, which will result in a different destination point.

DONE.
