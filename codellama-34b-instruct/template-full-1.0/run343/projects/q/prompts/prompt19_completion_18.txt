  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"buggy code fragment"
```
This would result in different behavior because the purpose of the code is to evaluate the line number of the captureLine function, but by replacing it with a different string, the result will be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unexpected behavior"
```
This would result in different behavior because the purpose of the code is to evaluate the line number of the captureLine function, but by replacing it with a different string, the result will be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the purpose of the code is to evaluate the line number of the captureLine function, but by replacing it with null, the result will be different.

DONE.
