  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error, while `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would not reject the promise, while `deferred.reject` would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would not reject the promise, while `deferred.reject` would.

DONE.
