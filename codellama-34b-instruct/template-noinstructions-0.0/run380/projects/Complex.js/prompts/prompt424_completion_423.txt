  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the number is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the number is finite, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` negates the result of `isInfinite`, so if the number is infinite, it would return `false`, and if the number is not infinite, it would return `true`.

DONE.
