  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method expects an array as an argument, and passing `null` would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is not an array, and passing it as an argument to `promiseDispatch` would cause a runtime error or incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because a string is not an array, and passing it as an argument to `promiseDispatch` would cause a runtime error or incorrect behavior.

DONE.
