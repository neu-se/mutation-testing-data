  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `length` property, unlike `args || []`, which would return an empty array if `args` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `length` property, unlike `args || []`, which would return an empty array if `args` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array does not have a `length` property, unlike `args || []`, which would return an empty array if `args` is falsy.

DONE.
