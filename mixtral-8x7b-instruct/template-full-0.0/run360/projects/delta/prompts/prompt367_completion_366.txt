 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'='
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison operator from `===` (strict equality) to `=` (assignment), which would always evaluate to `true` and potentially skip some iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'!=='
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison operator from `===` (strict equality) to `!==` (inequality), which would cause the loop to skip iterations when the types are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'<>'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the not-equal operator `<>`, which is not a standard JavaScript operator and would cause a syntax error. This change would break the code and cause it to fail during execution.

DONE.
