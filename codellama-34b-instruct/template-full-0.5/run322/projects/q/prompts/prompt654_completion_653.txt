  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with the wrong arguments, causing the `post` method to be called with incorrect parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with the wrong arguments, causing the `post` method to be called with incorrect parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with the wrong arguments, causing the `post` method to be called with incorrect parameters.

DONE.
