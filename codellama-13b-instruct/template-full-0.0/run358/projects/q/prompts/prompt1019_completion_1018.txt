  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `dispatch` method of the `Promise` object, while the buggy code fragment uses the `dispatch` method of the `Q` object. This could cause the code to behave differently, depending on the specific implementation of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `dispatch` method of the `Promise` object, while the buggy code fragment uses the `dispatch` method of the `Q` object, but with the `this` context bound to the `Promise` object. This could cause the code to behave differently, depending on the specific implementation of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `dispatch
