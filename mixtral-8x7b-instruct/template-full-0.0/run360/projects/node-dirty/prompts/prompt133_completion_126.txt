 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.has` checks if the key exists in the Map, but it doesn't delete the key-value pair. The original code fragment `this._queue.delete` removes the key-value pair, which can impact the further execution of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.clear
