 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy defer'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a thrown error would prevent the promise from being resolved or rejected as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise, rather than waiting for the Node-style callback to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return null; }
