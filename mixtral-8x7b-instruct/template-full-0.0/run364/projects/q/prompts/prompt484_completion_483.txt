 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array, while `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the original array. This means that modifying the returned array from `concat` would not affect the original `unhandledReasons` array, unlike with `slice`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.filter(x => true)
