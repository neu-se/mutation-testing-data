  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not always present in the `options` object, and the `readFileSync` method would throw an error if it is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throws` property is not always present in the `options` object, and the `readFileSync` method would throw an error if it is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property is not always present in the `options` object, and the `JSON.parse` method would throw an error if it is not provided.

DONE.
