Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the specific reason for the rejection at the index `at`, leading to incorrect information being emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the next element in the `unhandledReasons` array, which may not exist, resulting in `undefined` being emitted instead of the actual reason for the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the first reason in the `unhandledReasons` array, regardless of which promise is being untracked, potentially leading to misleading information about the rejection being handled.

DONE.
