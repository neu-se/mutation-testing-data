  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `a`. This change would cause the `log` function to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `b` is a different variable. This change would cause the `log` function to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a * b` is an expression that multiplies `a` by `b`. This change would cause the `log` function to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in
