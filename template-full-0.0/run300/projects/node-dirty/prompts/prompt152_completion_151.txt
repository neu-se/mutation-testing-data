  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `this._waitForDrain`, causing the `break` statement to be executed even if `this._waitForDrain` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the `break` statement would only be executed if `this._waitForDrain` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the `break` statement would be executed if `this._waitForDrain` is not `true`.

DONE.
