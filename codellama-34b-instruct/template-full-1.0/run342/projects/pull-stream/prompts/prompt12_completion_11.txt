  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator is used instead of `<` which would cause the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially leading to index out of bounds errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator is used instead of `<` which would cause the loop to never execute, leading to the function returning `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i != length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator is used instead of `<` which would cause the loop to iterate until the index is no longer equal to the length of the array, potentially leading to infinite loops.

DONE.
