  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.fail()` method is called twice, which would cause the rejection handler to be called twice, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve).then(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.then()` method is called twice, which would cause the resolution handler to be called twice, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject).then(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.then()` method is called twice, which would cause the rejection handler to be called twice, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
