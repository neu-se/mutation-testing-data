  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason, whereas `resolve` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error()` will throw an error and cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `resolve` will resolve the promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a promise that is rejected with no reason, whereas `resolve` will resolve the promise with the given value.

DONE.
