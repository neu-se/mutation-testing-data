  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `substr` method to start at the wrong index, potentially returning an incorrect substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `substr` method to start at the wrong index, potentially returning an incorrect substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `substr` method to return a substring that is too long, potentially causing the `next` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
