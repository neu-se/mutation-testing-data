  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the return value of the function it is called with, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value it is called with.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value it is called with, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value it is called with.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the value it is called with, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value it is called with.

DONE.
