  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Symbol.match` method on the `super` object, which is not the same as calling the `Symbol.match` method on the `Matcher` instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[Symbol.match](string)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Symbol.match` method on the `Matcher` instance, but it would not use the `super` object as the `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Matcher.prototype[Symbol.match].call(this, string)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Symbol.match` method on the `Matcher` prototype object, which is not the same as calling the `Symbol.match` method on the `Matcher` instance.

DONE.
