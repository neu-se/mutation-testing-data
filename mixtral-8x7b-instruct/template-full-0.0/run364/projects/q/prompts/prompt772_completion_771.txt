 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return []; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always resolve to an empty array, instead of an array of states for the input promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return Q.resolve('always resolved'); }
