 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to join a relative path to the `decodedBasename`, changing the destination directory to the current directory instead of using the original `options.dest`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `options.dest` with a meaningless empty function, causing the file write operation to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the URL as the destination path, causing the file to be written to an unexpected location, possibly outside of the project's directory.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing process can help identify potential gaps in the test suite's coverage, allowing developers to improve their tests and ensure the code's correctness and robustness.
