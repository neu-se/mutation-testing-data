  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with the same elements as the original, while `null` is a primitive value that cannot be called as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with the same elements as the original, while `undefined` is a primitive value that cannot be called as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with the same elements as the original, while `123` is a primitive value that cannot be called as a function.

DONE.
