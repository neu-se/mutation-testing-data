Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file(src, { name: 'wrongName.txt' });
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of adding the directory specified by `src`, it attempts to add a file with a hardcoded name 'wrongName.txt', which would not include the contents of the directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument `true` indicates that the directory should be stored with its full path, which may lead to incorrect file paths in the resulting archive compared to the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.append('dummy content', { name: 'dummy.txt' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a file with dummy content instead of the actual directory specified by `src`, leading to an empty or incorrect archive.

DONE.
