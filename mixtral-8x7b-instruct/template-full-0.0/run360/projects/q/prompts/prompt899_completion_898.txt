 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function. This change would cause the `fapply` method to fail, as it expects a function as its last argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function. This change would cause the `fapply` method to throw a TypeError, as it expects a function as its last argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a property, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function. This change would cause the `fapply` method to fail, as it expects a function as its last argument. Additionally, the `resolve` method
