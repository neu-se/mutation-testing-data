  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array that is the concatenation of the `args` array and any additional arguments passed to it, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array that contains the `args` array as its only element, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
