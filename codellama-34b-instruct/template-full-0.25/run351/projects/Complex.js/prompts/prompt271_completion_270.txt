  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the angle in the range of -π/2 to π/2, but adding `Math.PI` would shift the range to π/2 to 3π/2, which would cause the `arg` function to return incorrect values for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the angle in the range of -π/2 to π/2, but subtracting `Math.PI` would shift the range to -3π/2 to -π/2, which would cause the `arg` function to return incorrect values for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) * 2
```
This
