  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different verb than "throw", and it would cause the generator to yield a value instead of throwing an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because "next" is a different verb than "throw", and it would cause the generator to yield a value instead of throwing an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because "return" is a different verb than "throw", and it would cause the generator to return a value instead of throwing an exception.

DONE.
