Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `z` is zero instead of checking if `z` is infinite, which could lead to incorrect results when adding two complex numbers that are not both infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines two conditions, checking if `this` is infinite and if `z` is zero, which changes the logic of the addition operation and may not handle cases where only one of the numbers is infinite correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for infinity, meaning that the addition will incorrectly proceed even if `this` is infinite, potentially leading to erroneous results.

DONE.
