 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `args` if it is not falsy, while this change always passes an empty array. This could cause issues if the `nodeArgs` array relies on the values within `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `args` if it is not falsy, while this change passes `null` instead. This could cause issues if the `nodeArgs` array relies on the values within `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.args || []
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `args` if it is not falsy, while this change uses `global.args` if it exists, and falls back to an empty array. This could cause issues if the `nodeArgs` array relies on the values within `args`, and the code is running
