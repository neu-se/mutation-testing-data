  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(array_slice(arguments, 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `args` array with the `arguments` array starting from the second element, whereas the original code fragment concatenates the `args` array with the `arguments` array starting from the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(array_slice(arguments, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `args` array with the `arguments` array starting from the third element, whereas the original code fragment concatenates the `args` array with the `arguments` array starting from the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(array_slice(arguments, 3))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `args` array with the `arguments` array starting from the fourth element, whereas the original code fragment concatenates the `args`
