  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function, while `null` is not a function and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `var` is a keyword for declaring variables and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"cb"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `"cb"` is a string literal and would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
