  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return rejected("override");
```
This would result in different behavior because passing the string "override" as the first argument to the `rejected` function would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message, potentially causing tests to fail that were relying on the original error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve("override");
```
This would result in different behavior because passing the string "override" as the first argument to the `resolve` function would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value, potentially causing tests to fail that were relying on the original fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject("override");
```
This would result in different behavior because passing the string "override" as the first argument to the `reject` function would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message, potentially causing tests to fail that were relying on the original error message.

DONE.
