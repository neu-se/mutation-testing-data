Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase(), rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the input word to uppercase before testing it against the regular expression, potentially causing mismatches if the regex is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's', rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 's' to the word before testing it against the rule, which would always return true for words that do not already end with 's', leading to incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the second element of the rule array (the result) instead of the first (the match), which would cause the function to return the wrong value regardless of whether the word matched the rule.

DONE.
