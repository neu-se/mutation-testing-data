  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would not be assigned to `acc` when `!acc` is evaluated to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would only be assigned to `acc` when `acc` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would only be assigned to `acc` when `cb` is falsy.

DONE.
