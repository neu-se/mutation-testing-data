  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a `SyntaxError` while this code fragment throws an `Error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw 'Invalid Param';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a `SyntaxError` while this code fragment throws a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw 42;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a `SyntaxError` while this code fragment throws the number 42.

DONE.
