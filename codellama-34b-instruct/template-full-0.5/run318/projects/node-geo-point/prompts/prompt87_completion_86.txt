  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Number(distance) / radius) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDestination` method to calculate the angular distance in radians twice, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Number(distance) / radius) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDestination` method to add an extra degree to the angular distance, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Number(distance) / radius) * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDestination` method to calculate the angular distance in radians using the wrong formula, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
