  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the index would always be greater than the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, as the index would be equal to the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, as the index would be equal to the length of the array.

DONE.
