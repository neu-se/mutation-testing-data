  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops[this.index + 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if there is a next operation by checking if the current index is less than the length of the operations array, but this replacement code always returns the operation at the next index, regardless of whether it exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops[this.index] - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if there is a next operation by checking if the current index is less than the length of the operations array, but this replacement code always returns the operation at the previous index, regardless of whether it exists or not.
