  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] = a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a['abs']` property would be overwritten with the value of `a['arg']`, which could cause an error in the subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] = NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a['abs']` property would be set to `NaN`, which would cause any subsequent calculations to return `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a['abs']` property would be deleted, which could cause an error in the subsequent calculations.

DONE.
