 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_toString` would now return `[object Object]` instead of the expected string representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return "string"; }
