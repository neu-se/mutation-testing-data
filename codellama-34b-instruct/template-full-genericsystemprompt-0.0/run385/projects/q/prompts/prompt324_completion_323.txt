  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback.call(promise, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fallback` function with the `promise` object as the context, which would allow the `fallback` function to access the `promise` object's properties and methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback.apply(promise, [op, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fallback` function with the `promise` object as the context and pass the `op` and `args` arguments as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback.bind(promise, op, args)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to the `promise` object and calls the `fallback` function with the `op` and `args` arguments.

DONE.
