  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the size of the queue, while the new code fragment returns the size of the queue if it is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the size of the queue, while the new code fragment returns the length of the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.isEmpty()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the size of the queue, while the new code fragment returns whether the queue is empty or not.

DONE.
