  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `ops` is a non-empty array, regardless of whether `ops` is an array or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` if `ops` is not an array, regardless of whether `ops` is a non-empty array or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(ops) === '[object Array]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `ops` is an array, regardless of whether `ops` is a non-empty array or not.

DONE.
