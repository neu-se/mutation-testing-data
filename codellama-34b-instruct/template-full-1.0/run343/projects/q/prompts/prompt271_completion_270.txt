  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `notify` function to always return without doing anything, which would likely cause unintended side effects in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `notify` function to always return without doing anything, which would likely cause unintended side effects in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isPending()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the promise is still pending or not, and if it is, it would return without doing anything, which would likely cause unintended side effects in the surrounding code.

DONE.
