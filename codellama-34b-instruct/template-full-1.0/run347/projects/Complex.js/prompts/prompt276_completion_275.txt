  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `a + 1`
This would result in different behavior because the value of `a` would be incremented, which could change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `b`
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is different from `a`, so the result of the calculation would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `a * b`
This would result in different behavior because the result of the calculation would now be a product of `a` and `b`, rather than just `a`.

DONE.
