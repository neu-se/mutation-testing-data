 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length()` method expects an `Op` object, but it would receive a string instead, causing unexpected behavior or an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length()` expects a non-null object, and using `null` would cause an error, revealing that the code does not handle this edge case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
