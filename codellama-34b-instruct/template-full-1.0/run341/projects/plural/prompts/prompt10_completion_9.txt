  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|[quyz]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a different set of words, including those that end in "quyz" in addition to "quy".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$|[quyz]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would include an additional alternation branch to match words that end in "quyz" in addition to "quy".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$|[quyz]+$|^.{3}$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would include an additional alternation branch to match words that are exactly 3 characters long, regardless of whether they end in "quy" or "quyz".

DONE.
