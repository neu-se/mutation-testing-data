  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = iter.next(start - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different amount than the original code, potentially skipping or duplicating operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = iter.next(end - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different amount than the original code, potentially skipping or duplicating operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = iter.next(end - start);

DONE.
