  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This change will cause the `splice` method to insert the `newOp` object at the second index of the `ops` array, instead of the first index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp
```
This change will cause the `splice` method to insert the `newOp` object at the first index of the `ops` array, which is the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, -1, newOp
```
This change will cause the `splice` method to insert the `newOp` object at the last index of the `ops` array, which is the same as the original code.

DONE.
