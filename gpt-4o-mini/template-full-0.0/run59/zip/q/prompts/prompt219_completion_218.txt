Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of the original `value` would cause the function to return a non-promise value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when the caller expects a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of the original `value` would also result in a non-promise being returned, which could break the promise chain if the caller is expecting a promise to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"not a promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a string instead of the original `value` would cause the function to return a non-promise value, which would not fulfill the expected promise behavior and could lead to errors in promise handling.

DONE.
