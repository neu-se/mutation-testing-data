  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/^javascript:/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not replace the "javascript:" protocol in the href attribute, while the modified code fragment would remove it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/^mailto:/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not replace the "mailto:" protocol in the href attribute, while the modified code fragment would remove it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/^ftp:/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not replace the "ftp:" protocol in the href attribute, while the modified code fragment would remove it.

DONE.
