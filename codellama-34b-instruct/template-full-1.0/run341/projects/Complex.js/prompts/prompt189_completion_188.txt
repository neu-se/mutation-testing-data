  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true if `a` is not equal to zero, whereas the original code fragment would return true only if `a` is equal to zero.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true if the absolute value of `a` is less than zero, whereas the original code fragment would return true only if `a` is equal to zero.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true if `b` is not equal to zero, whereas the original code fragment would return true only if `a` is equal to zero and `b` is zero.

DONE.
