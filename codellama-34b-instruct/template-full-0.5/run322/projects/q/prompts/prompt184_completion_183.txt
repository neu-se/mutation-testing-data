  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the string "a" to a number, whereas the original code fragment would convert the number to a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return null, whereas the original code fragment would return a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined, whereas the original code fragment would return a number.

DONE.
