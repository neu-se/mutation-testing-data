  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `resolve` was not called, which would cause the promise to never be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(_rejected(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `resolve` was not called, which would cause the promise to never be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(_progressed(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `resolve` was not called, which would cause the promise to never be notified.

DONE.
