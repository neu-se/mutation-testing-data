  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function expects a non-null value for the `id` argument, but passing `null` would cause the function to return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function expects a non-zero value for the `id` argument, but passing `0` would cause the function to return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function expects a non-empty string value for the `id` argument, but passing an empty string would cause the function to return `undefined`.

DONE.
