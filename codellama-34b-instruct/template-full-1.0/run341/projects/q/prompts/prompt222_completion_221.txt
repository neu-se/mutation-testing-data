  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `resolve` property of the `defer` object, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `reject` property of the `defer` object, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
