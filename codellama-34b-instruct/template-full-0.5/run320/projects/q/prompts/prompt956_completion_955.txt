  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while the original code fragment returns a reference to the same array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new array that is a concatenation of the original array and the provided arguments, while the original code fragment returns a reference to the same array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.map(function(x) { return x })
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` returns a new array that is the result of applying the provided function to each element of the original array, while the original code fragment returns a reference to the same array.

DONE.
