  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.splice(0, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.reverse().push(newOp).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` reverses the order of the elements in an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
