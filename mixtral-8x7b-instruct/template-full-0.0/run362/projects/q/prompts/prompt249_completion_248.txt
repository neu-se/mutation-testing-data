 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` uses a regular expression and can return -1 if there is no match, whereas `indexOf` returns the index or -1 if the string is not found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split('\n').length
