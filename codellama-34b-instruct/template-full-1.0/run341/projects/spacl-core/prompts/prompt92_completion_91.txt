  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment is iterating over the policies themselves, while this code fragment is iterating over the key-value pairs of the policies map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment is iterating over the policies in the same order as the array, while this code fragment is iterating over the policies in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment is iterating over all the policies, while this code fragment is iterating over the policies starting from the second one (skipping the first policy).

DONE.
