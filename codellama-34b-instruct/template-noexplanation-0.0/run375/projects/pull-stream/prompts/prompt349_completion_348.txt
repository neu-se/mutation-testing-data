  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This change will cause the test to fail if the `test.test` function is not able to handle the additional argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This change will cause the test to fail if the `test.test` function is not able to handle the `length` property of the `data` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This change will cause the test to fail if the `test.test` function is not able to handle the `toString` method of the `data` object.

DONE.
