  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crise/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is no longer case-insensitive, meaning it will only match the exact text 'thesis' or 'crisis', and not 'Thesis' or 'CRISIS' as the original code did.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/g, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now uses the 'global' flag, meaning it will match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first occurrence as the original code did.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/, function(w) { return w.
