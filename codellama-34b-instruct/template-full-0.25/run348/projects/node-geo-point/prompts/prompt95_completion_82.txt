  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinφ1` is the sine of the latitude of the first point, while `sinφ2` is the sine of the latitude of the second point. Using `sinφ1` instead of `sinφ2` would result in a different calculation of the bearing between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosφ1` is the cosine of the latitude of the first point, while `sinφ2` is the sine of the latitude of the second point. Using `cosφ1` instead of `sinφ2` would result in a different calculation of the bearing between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1 + φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(φ1 + φ2)` is the sine of the sum of the latitudes of
