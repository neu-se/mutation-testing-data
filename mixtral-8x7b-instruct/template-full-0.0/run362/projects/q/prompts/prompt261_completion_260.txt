 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function would always return before calling `become`, and the `resolvedPromise` would not be updated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function would always return before calling `become`, and the `resolvedPromise` would be set to `null` instead of the new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function would always return before calling `become`, and the `resolvedPromise` would be set to the `deferred` object instead of the new promise.

DONE.
