  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to iterate one more time than it should, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to iterate one fewer time than it should, potentially leading to an incorrect result or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to use the length of the `otherIter` iterator instead of the `thisIter` iterator, potentially leading to an incorrect result or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
