  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let opLength = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `opLength` would be initialized to 0 in this option, whereas in the original code fragment it was initialized to the return value of `otherIter.peekLength()`, which could be any positive integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let opLength = Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because `opLength` would be initialized to `Infinity` in this option, whereas in the original code fragment it was initialized to the return value of `otherIter.peekLength()`, which could be any positive integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let opLength = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `opLength` would be initialized to `null` in this option, whereas in the original code fragment it was initialized to the return value of `otherIter.peekLength()`, which could be any positive integer.

DONE.
