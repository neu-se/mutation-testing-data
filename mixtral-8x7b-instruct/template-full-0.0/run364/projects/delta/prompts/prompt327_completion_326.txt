 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted.ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly manipulates the `ops` array of the `inverted` Delta object, bypassing any internal logic or checks that the original `inverted.push` might have.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes `null` into the `inverted` Delta object, which might not be handled correctly in the subsequent code, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted.push(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the `op` object from the outer scope into the `inverted` Delta object, which might not be the intended behavior. The original code fragment `inverted.push` is supposed to push a new, empty Op object, but this change would push an existing Op object
