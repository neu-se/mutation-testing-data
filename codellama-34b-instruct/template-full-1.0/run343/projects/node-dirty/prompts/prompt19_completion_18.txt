  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._queue` property is a Map object, and using it as a key in the `_queue` Map would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._queue.get(key)` method is a synchronous function that returns the value associated with `key` in the `_queue` Map, or `undefined` if the key is not found. Using it as a key in the `_queue` Map would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._queue.set(key)` method is a synchronous function that sets the value of `key` in the `_queue` Map to the value returned by the callback function. Using it as a key in the `_queue` Map would cause an error
