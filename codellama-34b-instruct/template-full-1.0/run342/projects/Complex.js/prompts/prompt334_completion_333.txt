  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to `0`, but this replacement checks if `b` is equal to `1`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should evaluate to `true`, leading to incorrect results in the calculation of `atan`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to `0`, but this replacement checks if `b` is equal to `NaN` (not a number). This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should evaluate to `true`, leading to incorrect results in the calculation of `atan`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
