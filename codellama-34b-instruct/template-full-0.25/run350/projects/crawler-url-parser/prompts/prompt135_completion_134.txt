  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would replace the last part of the URL path with a slash, which would change the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would replace the last part of the URL path with an empty string, which would change the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would replace the last part of the URL path with a space, which would change the URL.

DONE.
