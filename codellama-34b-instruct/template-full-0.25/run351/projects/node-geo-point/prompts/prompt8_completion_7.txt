  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `point` object has a `coordinates` property, while this new code checks if the `point` object has a `coordinates` property that is not inherited from its prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `point` object has a `type` property, while this new code checks if the `point` object has a `type` property that is not inherited from its prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `point` object has a `latitude` property, while this new code checks if the `point` object has a `latitude` property that is not inherited from its prototype.
