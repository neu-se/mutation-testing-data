  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a number, but `otherOp` itself is an object with `delete` and `retain` properties, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.ops[0].delete.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.ops` is an array of ops, but `thisIter.ops[0]` is an object with `delete` and `retain` properties, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0].delete.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.ops` is an array of ops, but `delta.ops[0]` is an object with `delete` and `retain` properties, so it would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
