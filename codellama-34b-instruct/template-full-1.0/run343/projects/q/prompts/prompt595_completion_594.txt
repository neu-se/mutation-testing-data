  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would try to pass the string "foo" as the value of 
the x variable, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would pass an undefined value as the value of
the x variable, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would pass a null value as the value of
the x variable, which would cause different behavior than the original code fragment.
