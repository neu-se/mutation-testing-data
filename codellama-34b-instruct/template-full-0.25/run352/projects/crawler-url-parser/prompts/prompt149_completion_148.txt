  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split(/\//).filter(function (elem, index, array) {
	return elem.length > 0
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `\/` is not escaped, which would cause the `split` method to return an array with a single element, rather than an array of substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split(/\//).filter(function (elem, index, array) {
	return elem.length > 1
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the filter function would only return elements that have a length greater than 1, which would exclude any substrings that are only a single character long.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split(/\//).filter(function (elem, index, array) {
	return elem.length > 2
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the
