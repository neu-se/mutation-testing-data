 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` immediately resolves the deferred object, bypassing the intended behavior of `deferred.notify` which is used to handle progress notifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise
