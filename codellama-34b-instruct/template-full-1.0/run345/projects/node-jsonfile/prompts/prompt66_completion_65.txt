  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0001/
```
This would result in different behavior because `\u0001` is not the same as `\uFEFF` and would not match the UTF-8 BOM.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[^]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except the UTF-8 BOM, whereas the original code fragment would only match the UTF-8 BOM.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag would cause the regex to match multiple occurrences of the UTF-8 BOM, whereas the original code fragment would only match the first occurrence.

DONE.
