  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are different variables representing different latitude values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` and `φ1` are different variables representing different longitude and latitude values, respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ2` and `φ1` are different variables representing different longitude and latitude values, respectively.

DONE.
