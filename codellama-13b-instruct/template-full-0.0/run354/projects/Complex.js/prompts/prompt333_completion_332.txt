  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would return `0` instead of `Infinity` when `b` is `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would return `0` instead of `Infinity` when `b` is `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would return `0` instead of `Infinity` when `b` is `-1`.

DONE.
