  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a SyntaxError with the message "Invalid Param", while this modified code fragment throws a SyntaxError with the message "Invalid Param1".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a SyntaxError with the message "Invalid Param", while this modified code fragment throws a SyntaxError with the message "Invalid Param" concatenated with the value of the variable `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a SyntaxError with the message "Invalid Param", while this modified code fragment throws a SyntaxError with the message "Invalid Param" concatenated with the value of the variable `b`.

DONE.
