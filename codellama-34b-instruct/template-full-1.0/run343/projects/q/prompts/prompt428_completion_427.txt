  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method returns an object that contains information about the promise's state, and the `state` property would return the fulfillment value of the promise if it is fulfilled or the rejection reason if it is rejected. By checking for the `state` property to be equal to "rejected", this code would detect whether the promise is in the rejected state, which is different from the original code that checked whether the `state` property is equal to "rejected" and the `reason` property is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
object.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `state` property is a string that indicates the promise's state, either "fulfilled", "rejected", or "pending". By checking whether the `state` property is equal to "rejected" without using the `inspect()` method, this code would detect
