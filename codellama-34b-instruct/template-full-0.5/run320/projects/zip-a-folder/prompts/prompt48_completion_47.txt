  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is not called, which would cause the archive to not be properly finalized and closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with `null` as the argument, which would cause the archive to be finalized and closed with an invalid argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with `undefined` as the argument, which would cause the archive to be finalized and closed with an invalid argument.

DONE.
