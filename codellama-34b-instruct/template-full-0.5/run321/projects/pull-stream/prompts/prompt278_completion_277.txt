  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper !== mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because `!mapper` will always evaluate to `false` if `mapper` is a function, while `mapper !== mapper` will only evaluate to `true` if `mapper` is a function that returns `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!mapper` will always evaluate to `false` if `mapper` is a function, while `!mapper(data)` will evaluate to `true` if `mapper` is a function that returns a falsy value for the given input `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) === mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!mapper` will always evaluate to `false` if `mapper` is a function, while `mapper(data) === mapper(data
