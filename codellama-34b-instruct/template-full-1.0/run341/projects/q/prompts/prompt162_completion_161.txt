  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method returns a portion of a string, whereas the `split` method returns an array of substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement, whereas the `split` method returns an array of substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new string that is the result of combining two or more strings, arrays, or other objects, whereas the `split` method returns an array of substrings.

DONE.
