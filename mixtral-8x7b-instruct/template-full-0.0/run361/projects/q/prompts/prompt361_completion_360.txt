 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved promise would be rejected instead, causing the chained `.then()` to not receive the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the `resolve` method on the promise object itself, which is not guaranteed to exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to resolve a new promise instead of resolving the existing deferred promise, causing the chained `.then()` to not receive the expected value.

DONE.
