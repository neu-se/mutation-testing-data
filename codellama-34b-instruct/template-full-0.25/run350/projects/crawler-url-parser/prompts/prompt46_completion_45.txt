  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns a URL object, while `URL.format` returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a URL object, while `URL.format` returns a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.toString` returns a string representation of the URL object, while `URL.format` returns a formatted string.

DONE.
