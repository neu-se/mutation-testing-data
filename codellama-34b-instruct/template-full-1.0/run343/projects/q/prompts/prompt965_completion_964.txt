  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (){}
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function is created without the ability to bind the correct "this" context for the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the "this" context of the function to the promise, instead of the correct "this" context for the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.call
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "nbind" function with the "this" context of the function, instead of the correct "this" context for the callback.

DONE.
