  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0] !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, whereas the `===` operator checks for equality. This means that the code would execute the `return` statement if the `type` of `rule[0]` is not a string or if `rule[0]` is not equal to `word`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0] === word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method converts the `word` to lowercase, which may not be the desired behavior. Additionally, the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the types of the operands must be the same. In this case, the `type` of `rule[0]` is a string, but the `type` of `word.toLowerCase()` is a string
