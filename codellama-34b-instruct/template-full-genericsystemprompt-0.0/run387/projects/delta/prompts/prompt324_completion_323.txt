  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to decrease by the length of the current operation, which could lead to incorrect results in the `eachLine` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to increase by the length of the current operation plus one, which could lead to incorrect results in the `eachLine` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to increase by the length of the current operation multiplied by two, which could lead to incorrect results in the `eachLine` method.

DONE.
