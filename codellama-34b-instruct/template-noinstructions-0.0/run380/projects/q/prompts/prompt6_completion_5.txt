  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "undefined" && typeof module === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `else` block, which would execute the `throw new Error()` statement, resulting in an error being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block, which would execute the `module.exports = definition();` statement, resulting in the `definition` function being exported as a module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "undefined" && typeof module === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block, which would execute the `module.exports = definition();` statement, resulting in the `definition` function being exported as a module.

DONE.
