  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "function" and never "RegExp", even when the rule[0] is a RegExp object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the constructor name of the rule[0] object, rather than checking whether it is a RegExp object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the toString representation of the rule[0] object, rather than checking whether it is a RegExp object.

DONE.
