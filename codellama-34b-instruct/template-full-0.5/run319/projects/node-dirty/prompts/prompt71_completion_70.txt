  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of 1, indicating that the database has one key, even if it is actually empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of -1, indicating that the database has -1 keys, which is not a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of null, indicating that the database is empty, even if it is not.

DONE.
