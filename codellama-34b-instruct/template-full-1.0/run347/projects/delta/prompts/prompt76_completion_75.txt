  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` and `{}` are different objects, even if they have the same keys and values. In this case, this would cause the function to return an empty object instead of the expected output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a number and `{}` is an object, so they are not equal and the function would return `false` instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a special value in JavaScript that means "not defined" or "no value", so it would cause the function to return `false` instead of `true`.

DONE.
