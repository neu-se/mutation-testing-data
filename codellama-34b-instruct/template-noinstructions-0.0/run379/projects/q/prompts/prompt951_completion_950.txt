  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to the function, while `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to the function, while `undefined` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any defined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to the function, while `[]` is an empty array that does not contain any arguments.

DONE.
