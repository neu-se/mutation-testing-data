Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return promise.reject(new Error("Forced rejection")); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the promise to be rejected with a specific error message, instead of returning the state of the promise, which could lead to the caller not receiving the expected state information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return promise.then(function() { return "Success"; }); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the return value to a string "Success" instead of the promise's state, which could mislead the caller into thinking the promise was fulfilled successfully when it may not have been.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return promise.inspect().state; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns only the state of the promise (e.g., "fulfilled" or "rejected") instead of the entire inspection object, which may omit important details such as the value or reason for rejection.

DONE.
