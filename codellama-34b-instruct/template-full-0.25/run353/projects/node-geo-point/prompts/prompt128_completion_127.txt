  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDistance` method to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `longitude` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDistance` method to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `longitude` property of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, { longitude: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a distance of 0, regardless of the actual distance between the two points.

DONE.
