Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always push the first operation into the line regardless of its position, effectively ignoring the actual index of the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the index by 1 each time, potentially causing the predicate to be called with an incorrect index value, leading to unexpected results in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the attributes of the next operation instead of the current operation, which could lead to incorrect attribute handling in the resulting Delta.

DONE.
