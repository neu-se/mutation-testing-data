  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw e;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment re-throws the error synchronously, while this replacement throws the error asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw e + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment re-throws the error with the same message, while this replacement throws the error with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("A different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment re-throws the error with the same message, while this replacement throws a different error with a different message.

DONE.
