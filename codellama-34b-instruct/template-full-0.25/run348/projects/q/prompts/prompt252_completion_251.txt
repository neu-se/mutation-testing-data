  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the context of the function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, and it would change the context of the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(newPromise, [message])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `message` argument as an array, which would change the behavior of the `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
