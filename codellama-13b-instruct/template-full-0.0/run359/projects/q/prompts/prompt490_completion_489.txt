  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` variable is not defined in the original code, and therefore the `untrackRejection` function would not be called. This would cause the unhandled rejection to be tracked, which would result in the `unhandledRejection` event being emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called, which would cause the unhandled rejection to be untracked. This would result in the `rejectionHandled` event being emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, which would cause the unhandled rejection to be tracked. This would result in the `unhandledRejection` event being emitted.

DONE.
