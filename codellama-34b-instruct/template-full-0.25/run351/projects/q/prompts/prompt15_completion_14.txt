  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var a = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is not defined in the original code, and its value would be `undefined` instead of `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var b = 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is not defined in the original code, and its value would be `undefined` instead of `2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var c = 3;
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is not defined in the original code, and its value would be `undefined` instead of `3`.

DONE.
