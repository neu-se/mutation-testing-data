  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|death/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "death" is not a valid irregular noun that needs to be pluralized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|jos/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "jos" is not a valid word that should be pluralized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|death/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "death" is not a valid irregular noun that needs to be pluralized.

DONE.
