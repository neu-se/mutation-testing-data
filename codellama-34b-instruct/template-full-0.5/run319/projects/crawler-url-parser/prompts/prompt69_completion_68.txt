  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `sourceUrl` as the base URL for parsing, while the new code uses a hardcoded URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `sourceUrl` to be a string, while the new code sets it to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `sourceUrl` to be a valid URL, while the new code sets it to an invalid URL.

DONE.
