Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, causing the block of code to execute when `extractFilename` is false instead of true, potentially leading to incorrect file path generation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.filename
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a non-existent property `filename` on the `options` object, which would always evaluate to false, thus skipping the file path generation logic entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks if `extractFilename` is false, which would allow the block to execute only when `extractFilename` is set to false, rather than when it is true, leading to potential issues in file path handling.

DONE.
