Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'load' event with a value of 1 instead of 0, which could mislead listeners into thinking that one item was loaded instead of none.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('No path provided'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits an error event instead of a load event, which could disrupt the normal flow of the application by signaling an error condition rather than indicating that loading has completed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'load' event with a null value instead of 0, which may not be handled correctly by listeners expecting a number, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
