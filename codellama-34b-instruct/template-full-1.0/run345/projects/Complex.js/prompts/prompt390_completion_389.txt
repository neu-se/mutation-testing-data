  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error, which is not the case in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the imaginary part, which is not the case in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the real part, which is not the case in the original code fragment.

DONE.
