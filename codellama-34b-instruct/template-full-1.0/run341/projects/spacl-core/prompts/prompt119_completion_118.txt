  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb
```
This would result in different behavior because `verb` is a property of the `Rule` class, but `path` is a parameter of the `matches` method. Using `verb` instead of `path` would change the way the rule is applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex.test(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `regex.test(path)` returns a boolean, but `path` is a string. Using `regex.test(path)` would change the way the rule is applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof path
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof path` returns a string, but `path` is a parameter of the `matches` method. Using `typeof path` would change the way the rule is applied.

DONE.
