  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `baseUrlStr` has illegal characters, while the new code checks if `baseUrlStr` converted to lowercase has illegal characters. This could cause some edge cases to be missed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `baseUrlStr` has illegal characters, while the new code checks if `baseUrlStr` converted to uppercase has illegal characters. This could cause some edge cases to be missed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr.replace(/[a-z]/g, c => String.fromCharCode(c.charCodeAt(0) +
