  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first word of the stack line, which may not be the file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the last word of the stack line, which may not be the file name and line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ").slice(1).join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second and subsequent words of the stack line, which may not be the file name and line number.

DONE.
