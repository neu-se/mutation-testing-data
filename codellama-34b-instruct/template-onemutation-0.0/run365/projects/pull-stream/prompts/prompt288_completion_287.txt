  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `end` argument is truthy, while the new code fragment always passes `null` as the second argument to the `cb` function, which may cause the function to behave differently in certain cases.
