  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would close the write stream immediately, whereas `uncork()` would flush any remaining data in the buffer and then stop flushing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` would close the write stream and emit an error, whereas `uncork()` would simply flush any remaining data in the buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` would write an empty string to the stream, whereas `uncork()` would flush any remaining data in the buffer.

DONE.
