  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit('drain')` will emit the 'drain' event immediately, whereas `this.close()` will close the dirty db file streams.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('close');
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit('close')` will emit the 'close' event immediately, whereas `this.close()` will close the dirty db file streams.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('drain'));
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit('error', new Error('drain'))` will emit an 'error' event with a message 'drain', whereas `this.close()` will close the dirty db file streams.

DONE.
