  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl` is a different variable than `currentUrl`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl` is a different variable than `currentUrl`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid URL and would cause the `gettype` function to throw an error.

DONE.
