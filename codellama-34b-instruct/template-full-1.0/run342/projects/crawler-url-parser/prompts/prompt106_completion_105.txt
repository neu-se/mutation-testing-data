  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.add
```
This would result in different behavior because the `add` method is only used to add a key-value pair to the map, while the `set` method is used to set the value associated with a particular key, overwriting any existing value. In this case, using `add` instead of `set` would cause the program to treat each URL as unique, even if it has already been visited, and would add a new entry to the map for every visited URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is used to remove the value associated with a particular key from the map, while `set` is used to set the value associated with a particular key. In this case, using `delete` instead of `set` would cause the program to remove any previously visited URLs from the map, effectively resetting the list of visited URLs every time a new URL is found.
