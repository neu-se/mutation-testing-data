  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<AttributeMap>){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the brackets are optional when using the `AttributeMap` type, but including them would make the code more explicit and protect against incorrect usage.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(AttributeMap.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create` creates a new object with the specified prototype, whereas the `AttributeMap` type is an extension of the `Map` type and provides additional functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<AttributeMap>){...attributes}
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread operator (`...`) would spread the attributes into a new object, whereas the `AttributeMap` type expects a single object as its parameter.

DONE.
