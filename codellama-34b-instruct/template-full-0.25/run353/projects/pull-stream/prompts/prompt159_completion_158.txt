  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `_value`, while the mutated code fragment returns the value of `_value` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `_value`, while the mutated code fragment returns the value of `_value` multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `_value`, while the mutated code fragment returns the value of `_value` minus 1.

DONE.
