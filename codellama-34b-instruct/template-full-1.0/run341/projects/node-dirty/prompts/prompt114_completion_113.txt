  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'drain' is never emitted by the `Dirty` class, while 'load' is emitted when the data is loaded from the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'error' is emitted when there is an error loading the data from the database, while 'load' is emitted when the data is successfully loaded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'write_close' is emitted when the write stream is closed, while 'load' is emitted when the data is loaded from the database.

DONE.
