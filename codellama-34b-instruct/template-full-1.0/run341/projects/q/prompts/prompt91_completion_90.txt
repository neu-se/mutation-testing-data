  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method of `String` objects, not `Array` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` is a method of `Array` objects that executes a function on each element of the array, while `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether an element is present in the array, while `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

DONE.
