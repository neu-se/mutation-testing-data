  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` parameter is being incremented by 1, which would cause the `delete` operation to delete one more character than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` parameter is being decremented by 1, which would cause the `delete` operation to delete one fewer character than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` parameter is being multiplied by 2, which would cause the `delete` operation to delete twice as many characters as the original code.

DONE.
