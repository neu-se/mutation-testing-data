  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because `finish` is emitted when the compression process is complete, while `close` is emitted when the output stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is emitted when the output stream has been ended, while `close` is emitted when the output stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because `error` is emitted when there is an error in the compression process, while `close` is emitted when the output stream is closed.

DONE.
