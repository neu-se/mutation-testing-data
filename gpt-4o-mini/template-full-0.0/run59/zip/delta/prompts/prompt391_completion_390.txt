Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the iterator to advance by one operation regardless of the length of the current operation, potentially skipping over important operations that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, which means the same operation could be processed multiple times instead of moving forward in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively does nothing to advance the iterator, leading to an infinite loop if the current operation is not a 'delete', as it would keep processing the same operation repeatedly.

DONE.
