Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality of the `insert` properties of `thisOp` and `otherOp`, which may not account for cases where the two objects are structurally equal but not the same reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the `isEqual` function, meaning that the condition will now be true when the two `insert` properties are not equal, potentially leading to incorrect handling of equal operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `thisOp.insert` is not null, ignoring the value of `otherOp.insert`, which could lead to incorrect logic when both `insert` values are relevant for the equality check.

DONE.
