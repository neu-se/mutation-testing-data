  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `slice()` to create a shallow copy of the `ops` array, while `reverse()` would mutate the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `slice()` to create a shallow copy of the `ops` array, while `concat()` would create a new array with the elements of the original array and the additional elements passed as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(op => op)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `slice()` to create a shallow copy of the `ops` array, while `map()` would create a new array with the results of calling the provided function on each element of the original array.

DONE.
