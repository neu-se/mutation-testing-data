  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with the value passed to it, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the value passed to it, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.notify` is a function that notifies the promise with the value passed to it, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a new promise.

DONE.
