  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, while `exception` is an object, and the code expects an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error(exception)` throws a new error with the original error as the message, while the original code just throws the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.stack` is a string, while `exception` is an object, and the code expects an object.

DONE.
