  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the argument `a` to be multiplied by pi, which would result in a different output for the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `cosh` function with the `sin` function, which would change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the division to be done with `a` instead of `2*a`, which would result in a different output for the function.

DONE.
