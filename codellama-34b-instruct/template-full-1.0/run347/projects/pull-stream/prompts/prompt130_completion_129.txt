  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the value of `i` to the console, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `i`, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment `i` by 1 and then return the value of `i`, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

DONE.
