 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty array instead of slicing the `base` Delta, causing unexpected results or errors in the rest of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
base.ops.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `ops` property of the `base` Delta and tries to slice it, but it doesn't create a new iterator for the slice, which might cause issues if the original iterator has side effects or if the code relies on the iterator's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
base.ops.slice(0, 10).concat(base.ops.slice(10))
