  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1` and `point2` are different objects, and the longitude value of `point2` may not be the same as the longitude value of `point1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be shifted by 180 degrees, which could result in a different calculation for the distance and bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be shifted by 180 degrees in the opposite direction, which could also result in a different calculation for the distance and bearing.

DONE.
