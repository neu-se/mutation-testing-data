  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule.clone(null)` would create a new `Rule` object with a `null` value for the `name` property, whereas the original code fragment would create a new `Rule` object with the same `name` property as the original `rule`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(rule.name + " (cloned)")
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule.name + " (cloned)"` would create a new `Rule` object with a modified `name` property, whereas the original code fragment would create a new `Rule` object with the same `name` property as the original `rule`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(rule.name, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule.clone(rule.name, false)` would create a new `Rule` object with the same `name`
