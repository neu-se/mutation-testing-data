  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` calculation would be incorrect, potentially resulting in an infinite loop or incorrect output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - (index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` calculation would be incorrect, potentially resulting in an infinite loop or incorrect output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - (index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` calculation would be incorrect, potentially resulting in an infinite loop or incorrect output.

DONE.
