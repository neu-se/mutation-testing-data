  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `parse(url, baseUrlStr)`. This would result in different behavior because the original `parse(url)` call expects a single argument, but the modified call passes two arguments, which could cause errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `parse(url, baseUrl)`. This would result in different behavior because the original `parse(url)` call expects a single argument, but the modified call passes two arguments, which could cause errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `urlMap.values().next().value.url`. This would result in different behavior because the original `parse(url)` call expects a single argument, but the modified call passes a different argument, which could cause errors.

DONE.
