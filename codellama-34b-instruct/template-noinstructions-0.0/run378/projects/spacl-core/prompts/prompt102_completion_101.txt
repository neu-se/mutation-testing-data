  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ctx` is used to pass the query context to the `query` method of the `Policy` object, while replacing it with `null` would cause the `query` method to receive a `null` context instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ctx` is used to pass the query context to the `query` method of the `Policy` object, while replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `query` method to receive an `undefined` context instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ctx` is used to pass the query context to the `query` method of the `Policy` object, while replacing it with an empty object `{}` would cause the `query` method to receive an empty context instead.

DONE.
