  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, { deprecated: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverTimezones` function would return all timezones, including deprecated ones, instead of only non-deprecated ones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, { deprecated: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverTimezones` function would return only non-deprecated timezones, instead of all timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverTimezones` function would return only non-deprecated timezones, instead of all timezones, and would not include the `deprecated` property in the returned object.

DONE.
