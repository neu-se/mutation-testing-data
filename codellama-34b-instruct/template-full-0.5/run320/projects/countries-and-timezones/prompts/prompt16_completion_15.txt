  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push()` adds a new element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different array than `current`, so adding an element to `all` would not affect the `current` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.push(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because `id` is a different value than `tz.r`, so adding a different value to the `current` array would change the resulting object.

DONE.
