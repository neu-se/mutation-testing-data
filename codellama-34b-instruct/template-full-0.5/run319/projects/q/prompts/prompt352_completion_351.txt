  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `rejected` function with the `exception` argument, while this new code fragment would throw an error with the message "rejected".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `rejected` function with the `exception` argument, while this new code fragment would return a resolved promise with the `exception` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `rejected` function with the `exception` argument, while this new code fragment would return a rejected promise with the `exception` value.

DONE.
