  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, "extra arg"]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the `args` array, which could potentially cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `args` array is removed, which could potentially cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(["extra arg"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the end of the `args` array, which could potentially cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

DONE.
