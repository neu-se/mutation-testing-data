  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline + start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `newline` and `start` variables, rather than using them as separate arguments to the `indexOf` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - newline
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the `newline` variable from the `start` variable, rather than using them as separate arguments to the `indexOf` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + newline
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `newline` variable to the `start` variable, rather than using them as separate arguments to the `indexOf` method.

DONE.
