  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options)
```
This code fragment is a function call to the `stringify` function, which is defined in the `utils` module. It takes two arguments: `obj`, which is the object to be stringified, and `options`, which is an object that contains options for the stringification process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, options)
```
This code fragment is a function call to the `JSON.stringify` function, which is a built-in JavaScript function that takes two arguments: `obj`, which is the object to be stringified, and `options`, which is an object that contains options for the stringification process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This code fragment is a function call to the `toString` method of the `obj` object, which is a built-in JavaScript method that returns a string representation of the object.

DONE.
