  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be comparing the length of the operations in the two deltas, rather than the length of the operations in the same delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding the length of the operations in the two deltas together, rather than comparing them.

DONE.
