  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would round the latitude and longitude values to the next higher integer, which could result in a different geographic location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would round the latitude and longitude values to the next lower integer, which could result in a different geographic location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would round the latitude and longitude values to twice the original precision, which could result in a different geographic location.

DONE.
