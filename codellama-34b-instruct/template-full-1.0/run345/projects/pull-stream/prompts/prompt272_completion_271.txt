  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream` is a function that is not called in the original code, and calling it would return a new stream instead of the original one.
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream + 1` would return a new stream with the value of the original stream plus 1, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is not a stream, and the original code assumes that the `stream` variable is a stream.
DONE.
