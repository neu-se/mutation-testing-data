  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args || []` would return an empty array if `args` is falsy, but `null` would be returned instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args || []` would return an empty array if `args` is falsy, but `undefined` would be returned instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args || []` would return an empty array if `args` is falsy, but `0` would be returned instead.

DONE.
