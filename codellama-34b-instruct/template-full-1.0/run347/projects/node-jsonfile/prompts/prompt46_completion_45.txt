  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is a asynchronous function that returns a promise, while `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that does not return any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync("some-other-file", str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write the data to a different file than the specified `file` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, "some-other-data", options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write different data to the specified file than the `obj` parameter.

DONE.
