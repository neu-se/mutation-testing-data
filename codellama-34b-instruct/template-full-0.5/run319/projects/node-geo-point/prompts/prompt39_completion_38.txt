  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the bitwise AND operator, while this replacement uses the addition operator. The bitwise AND operator will only return 1 if both operands are 1, while the addition operator will return the sum of the operands.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the bitwise AND operator, while this replacement uses the subtraction operator. The bitwise AND operator will only return 1 if both operands are 1, while the subtraction operator will return the difference of the operands.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the bitwise AND operator, while this replacement uses the multiplication operator. The bitwise AND operator will only return 1 if both operands are 1, while the multiplication operator will return the product
