  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekLength() > length) { thisIter.next(length); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking the peek length against a different value, causing the iteration to stop at a different point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherIter.peekLength() < length) { otherIter.next(length); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking the peek length against a different value, causing the iteration to stop at a different point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (length > 0) { length += 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking the length against a different value, causing the iteration to stop at a different point.

DONE.
