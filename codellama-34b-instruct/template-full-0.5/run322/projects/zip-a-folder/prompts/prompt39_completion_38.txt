  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first element of the split array, whereas the original code fragment considers all elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider all elements except the first one, whereas the original code fragment considers all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').filter((part) => part.length > 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider only the elements that have a length greater than 1, whereas the original code fragment considers all elements.

DONE.
