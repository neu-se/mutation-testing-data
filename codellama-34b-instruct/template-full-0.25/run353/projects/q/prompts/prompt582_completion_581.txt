  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method returns a new function with a bound context, but the context is not used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method returns a new function with a bound context, which is then used in the `verb` parameter of the `generator[verb]` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(generator, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method returns a new function with a bound context, which is then used in the `verb` parameter of the `generator[verb]` method.

DONE.
