  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `undefined`, and the original code fragment checks for the presence of the `b` variable, while the new code fragment checks for the presence of the `b` variable and its value being not `null`.

DONE.
