  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `ops.push()`. The original code fragment is pushing a new operation onto the `ops` array, whereas this code fragment is pushing `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `ops.push()`. The original code fragment is pushing a new operation onto the `ops` array, whereas this code fragment is pushing `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.splice(0, 0, ops.pop());
```
This would result in different behavior because it is inserting a new operation at the beginning of the `ops` array instead of pushing it onto the end.

DONE.
