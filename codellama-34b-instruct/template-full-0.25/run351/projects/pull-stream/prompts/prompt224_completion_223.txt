  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the result of the `test` function. If the `test` function returns `true`, the `!test` expression would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with a different argument. The original code fragment passed `data` as an argument, but the new code fragment passes `data` as a parameter to the `test` function. This could potentially change the behavior of the `test` function, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.call(this, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is being used to call the `test` function with a different `this` value. The original code fragment did not use `call`, so the
