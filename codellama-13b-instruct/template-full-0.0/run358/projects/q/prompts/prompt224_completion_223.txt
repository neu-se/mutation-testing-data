  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to return a promise that is already resolved, rather than a promise that is not yet resolved. This could cause issues if the promise is used in a way that expects it to be unresolved, such as in a `then` or `catch` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to return a promise that is already resolved, rather than a promise that is not yet resolved. This could cause issues if the promise is used in a way that expects it to be unresolved, such as in a `then` or `catch` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to return a promise that is already resolved, rather than a promise that is not yet resolved
