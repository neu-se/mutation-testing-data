Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch(function () { throw reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the handling of the rejection; instead of throwing the reason directly, it uses the `catch` method, which may alter the promise chain and how rejections are propagated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { return undefined; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with `undefined` instead of throwing the rejection reason, effectively swallowing the error and not propagating it to the next handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { return Promise.resolve(reason); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the rejection reason in a resolved promise, which changes the nature of the rejection handling, as it would not throw an error but instead resolve to a promise containing the reason.

DONE.
