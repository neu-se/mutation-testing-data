  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is a different variable than `y`, and it may not have the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosθ` is a different value than `y`, and it may not have the same effect on the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinθ` is a different value than `y`, and it may not have the same effect on the calculation.

DONE.
