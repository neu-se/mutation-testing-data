  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(null, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with `null` as the context, which would cause the `this` keyword to be bound to `null` inside the `pull` function. This would result in a different behavior than the original code, where `this` is bound to the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(undefined, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with `undefined` as the context, which would cause the `this` keyword to be bound to `undefined` inside the `pull` function. This would result in a different behavior than the original code, where `this` is bound to the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(window, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with `window` as the
