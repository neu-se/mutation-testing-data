 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.trim.call( $(this).text() )
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `call` method to explicitly set the `this` context to an empty string, which would remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the result of `$(this).text()`. The original code uses the `trim` method directly on the jQuery object, which may not work as expected if the `text` method returns a non-string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).html().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `html` method to get the inner HTML of the element, and then calls the `trim` method on the result. This could potentially include extra whitespace or HTML tags that were not present in the original code, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).text().replace(/\s+/g, ' ')
