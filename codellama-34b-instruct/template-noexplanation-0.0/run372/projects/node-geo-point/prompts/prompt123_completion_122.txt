  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to use the longitude of the `point` object instead of the latitude, which will result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude + 1
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to use the latitude of the `point` object plus 1 degree, which will result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude + 1
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to use the longitude of the `point` object plus 1 degree, which will result in a different bearing calculation.

DONE.
