  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.isBuffer()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the argument is a buffer, and the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `Buffer.isBuffer(content) === false` expression would always evaluate to `false`, even if `content` is a buffer, because the `Buffer.isBuffer()` method would return `true` and the `===` operator would compare `true` to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `Buffer.isBuffer()` method, so if `content` is a buffer, the expression would evaluate to `false`, and if `content` is not a buffer, the expression would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) !==
