Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive value for the imaginary part, regardless of the sign indicated by `minus`, thus potentially altering the intended sign of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1]) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of the imaginary part, which could lead to incorrect calculations when adding or manipulating complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1]) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the parsed value of the imaginary part, which would change the actual value being assigned and could lead to incorrect results in subsequent calculations.

DONE.
