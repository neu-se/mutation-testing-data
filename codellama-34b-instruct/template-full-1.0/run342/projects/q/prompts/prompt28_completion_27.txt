  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task()
```
This would result in a different behavior because `task` is a function, so calling it without arguments would execute the function, which may have different side effects than passing the `task` function object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tail.task()
```
This would result in a different behavior because `tail.task` is a function, so calling it without arguments would execute the function, which may have different side effects than passing the `tail.task` function object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
someOtherTask()
```
This would result in a different behavior because `someOtherTask` is a different function than `task` or `tail.task`, so calling it would execute a different function altogether.

DONE.
