  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(hypot(a, b))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` takes a single argument, whereas `logHypot` takes two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` takes a single argument, whereas `logHypot` takes two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` takes a single argument, whereas `logHypot` takes two arguments.

DONE.
