  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `options` object to the `countries[id]` property, instead of returning it as the function's return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] + options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform an addition operation on the `countries[id]` property and the `options` object, instead of returning the `countries[id]` property as the function's return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] * options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a multiplication operation on the `countries[id]` property and the `options` object, instead of returning the `countries[id]` property as the function's return value.

DONE.
