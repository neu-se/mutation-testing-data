 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
['', '', ctx]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty string for `path` and `verb`, which may not match the original policy's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, undefined, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `undefined` for `verb`, which may not match the original policy's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `undefined` for `ctx`, which may not match the original policy's behavior when dealing with context-dependent paths.

DONE.
