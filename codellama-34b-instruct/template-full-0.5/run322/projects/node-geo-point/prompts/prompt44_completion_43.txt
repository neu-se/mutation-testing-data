  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(point1Rad, point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` returns the arctangent of the ratio of its arguments, whereas `acos` returns the arccosine of its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(point1Rad) * Math.sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of its argument, whereas `acos` returns the arccosine of its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(point1Rad * point1Rad + point2Rad * point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of its argument, whereas `acos` returns the arccosine of its argument.

DONE.
