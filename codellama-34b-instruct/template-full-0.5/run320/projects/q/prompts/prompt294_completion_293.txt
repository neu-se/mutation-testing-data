  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called instead of `deferred.reject`, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would be called instead of `deferred.reject`, which would cause the promise to notify progress instead of reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would be called instead of `deferred.reject`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message.

DONE.
