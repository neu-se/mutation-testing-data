  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"@@"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the "@" symbol is used to match any single character in a regular expression, but in this modified code, it would match the literal string "@@".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"%"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the "@" symbol is used to match any single character in a regular expression, but in this modified code, it would match the literal string "%".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the "@" symbol is used to match any single character in a regular expression, but in this modified code, it would match the literal string "#".

DONE.
