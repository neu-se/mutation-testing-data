  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `nodeback`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` and the `else` block to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the value of `nodeback`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `then` block to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the value of `nodeback`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `then` block to be executed.

DONE.
