  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next` returns the next value in the iteration, whereas `iter.peek` returns the next value without advancing the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek - 1` returns the previous value in the iteration, whereas `iter.peek` returns the next value without advancing the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek + 1` returns the next value after the next value in the iteration, whereas `iter.peek` returns the next value without advancing the iteration.

DONE.
