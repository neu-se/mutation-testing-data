 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method of the returned promise would behave differently when called with `null` thisp.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method of the returned promise would behave differently when called with an empty array thisp.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method of the returned promise would behave differently when called with a resolved promise thisp.

DONE.
