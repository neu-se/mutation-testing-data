  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method is not defined in the `Q` object, and it would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` method is not defined in the `Q` object, and it would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfbind(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfbind` method is not defined in the `Q` object, and it would cause a reference error.

DONE.
