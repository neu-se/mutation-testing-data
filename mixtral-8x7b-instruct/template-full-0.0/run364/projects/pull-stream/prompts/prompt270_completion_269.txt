 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it no longer checks if `stream` is an object. It only checks if `stream` is not null, which would cause the `once` function to always be used, even if `stream` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && typeof stream === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the conditions has been changed. In the original code, if `stream` is falsy, it would still check the type of `stream`. In this mutated code, if `stream` is falsy, it will not check the type and will always use the `once` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && typeof stream.constructor === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `stream` is an instance of an object with a constructor function, rather than just checking if it's an object.
