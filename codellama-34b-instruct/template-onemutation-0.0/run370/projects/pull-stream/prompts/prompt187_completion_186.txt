  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. In the original code, the `if` statement checks if `abort` is truthy, and if so, it returns `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)`. If `abort` is `undefined`, the `if` statement would not be executed, and the function would return `cb(true)`. By replacing `null` with `undefined`, we are changing the behavior of the function to always return `cb(true)`, even if `abort` is truthy.

DONE.
