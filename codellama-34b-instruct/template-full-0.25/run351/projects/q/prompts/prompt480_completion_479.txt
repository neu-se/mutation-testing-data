  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the array, whereas `splice()` removes an element at a specific index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of the array, whereas `splice()` removes an element at a specific index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array, whereas `splice()` removes an element at a specific index.

DONE.
