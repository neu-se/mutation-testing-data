  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, and therefore would not have a `promiseDispatch` method that could be called. However, in the original code, `self` is an object that has a `promiseDispatch` method, which is called with the resolved value of `self` as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and therefore would not have a `promiseDispatch` method that could be called. However, in the original code, `self` is an object that has a `promiseDispatch` method, which is called with the resolved value of `self` as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object `{}` does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, which would cause an error when trying to call it. However,
