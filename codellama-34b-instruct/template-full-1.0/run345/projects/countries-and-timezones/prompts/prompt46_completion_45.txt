  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const options = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer accept any options passed to it, while the original code would have allowed options to be passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const options = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer accept any options passed to it, while the original code would have allowed options to be passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const options = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would interpret 0 as a falsy value, while the original code would have accepted it as a truthy value.

DONE.
