  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `1`, instead of the actual number of loaded keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a negative value, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that handles the `load` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 'foo');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a string value, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that handles the `load` event.

DONE.
