  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally return a promise, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER> || null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if the promise is rejected, causing the `Promise.all` function to resolve with an array of `null` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER> || Q(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new promise that resolves with `null` if the original promise is rejected, allowing the `Promise.all` function to resolve with an array of promises that all resolve with `null` values.

DONE.
