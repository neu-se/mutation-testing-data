  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would initialize the `current` property with the `id` value, instead of an empty array. This would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different object, which might not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would initialize the `all` property with the `id` value, instead of an empty array. This would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different object, which might not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would initialize both the `current` and `all` properties with the `id` value, instead of empty arrays
