  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was intended to return the value of the variable `b`, while the replacement code fragment would return the value `0` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was intended to return the value of the variable `b`, while the replacement code fragment would return the value `b + 1` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was intended to return the value of the variable `b`, while the replacement code fragment would return the value `b - 1` instead.

DONE.
