Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedBaseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `parsedBaseUrl` instead of `parsedUrl`, which means it will always resolve the base URL against itself rather than the current URL, leading to incorrect URL resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, 'http://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a hardcoded URL ('http://example.com') instead of the dynamically parsed `parsedUrl`, which would ignore the actual current URL being processed and always resolve to the same endpoint.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it formats the base URL instead of resolving it with the current URL, which means the function would return the base URL as a string rather than a resolved URL object, potentially breaking the expected output structure.

DONE.
