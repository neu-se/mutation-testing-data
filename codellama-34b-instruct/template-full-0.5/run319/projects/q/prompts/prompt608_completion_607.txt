  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, and `Q.dispatch` assumes that `args` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an array, and `Q.dispatch` assumes that `args` is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array `[]` is not the same as the original `args` array, and `Q.dispatch` may rely on the specific elements in the `args` array.

DONE.
