 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 201
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now checks for a status code of 201 (Created) instead of 200 (OK), potentially causing the function to reject valid responses.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode > 299
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now rejects any response with a status code higher than 299 (including 3xx redirects and 4xx client errors), which might not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.headers['content-length'] !== '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now checks the 'content-length' header instead of the status code, potentially causing the function to reject responses with a body or rejecting valid responses with an empty body.

DONE.
