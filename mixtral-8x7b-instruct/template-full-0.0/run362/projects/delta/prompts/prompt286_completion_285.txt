 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'', start
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would be used as the index for the newline character, potentially causing issues in the code that relies on the correct index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newline, thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the current operation would be used as the index for the newline character, which could cause issues if the length is not equal to the expected index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'', 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be set to 0, which could cause issues in the code that relies on the correct index.

DONE.
