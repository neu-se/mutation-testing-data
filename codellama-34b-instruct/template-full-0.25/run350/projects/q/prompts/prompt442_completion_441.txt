  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the event name to be "unhandledRejectionfoo" instead of "unhandledRejection", which could cause the event to not be handled properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "bar"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the event name to be "unhandledRejectionbar" instead of "unhandledRejection", which could cause the event to not be handled properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "baz"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the event name to be "unhandledRejectionbaz" instead of "unhandledRejection", which could cause the event to not be handled properly.

DONE.
