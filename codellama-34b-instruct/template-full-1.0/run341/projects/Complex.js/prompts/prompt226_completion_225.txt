  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` expects two arguments, while `Math.sqrt` only expects one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` calculates the exponential function, while `Math.sqrt` calculates the square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` calculates the sine function, while `Math.sqrt` calculates the square root.

DONE.
