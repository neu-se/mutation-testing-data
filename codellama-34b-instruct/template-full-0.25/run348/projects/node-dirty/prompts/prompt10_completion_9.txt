  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `path` property is truthy, while this replacement checks if the `_data` map has any elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `path` property is truthy, while this replacement checks if the `_queue` map has any elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `path` property is truthy, while this replacement checks if there are any in-flight writes.

DONE.
