  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 + 540) % 360 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert the longitude value from radians to degrees, but the new code fragment uses a different formula that is not equivalent. The `rad2deg` function is a standard function from the `Math` library, and it is widely used in geospatial applications to convert between radians and degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 + 180) % 360 - 180
