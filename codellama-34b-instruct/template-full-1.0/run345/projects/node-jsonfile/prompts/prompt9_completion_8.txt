  Here are three options for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than the original `data`, which is a string. The `stripBom` function would not change `undefined` to the same value as `data`, resulting in a different return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than the original `data`, which is a string. The `stripBom` function would not change `null` to the same value as `data`, resulting in a different return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` method would parse the `data` string and return an object, whereas the original code did not parse the `data` string. This would result in a different return value.

DONE.
