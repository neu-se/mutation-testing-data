  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `end` and `data` arguments, whereas the original code only called `cb` with the `data` argument. This could cause the `next` function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with an additional argument, `1`, whereas the original code only called `cb` with the `end` and `data` arguments. This could cause the `next` function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data, "test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with an additional argument, `"test"`, whereas the original code only called `cb` with
