  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout()` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick()` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
