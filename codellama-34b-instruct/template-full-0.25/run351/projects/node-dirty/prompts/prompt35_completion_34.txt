  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `undefined`, and it would cause the `set` method to behave differently when the value is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 'foo', cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `'foo'` is a different value than `undefined`, and it would cause the `set` method to behave differently when the value is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 0, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `undefined`, and it would cause the `set` method to behave differently when the value is a number.

DONE.
