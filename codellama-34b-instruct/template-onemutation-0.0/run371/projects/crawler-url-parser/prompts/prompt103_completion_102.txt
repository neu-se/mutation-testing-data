  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the result of the `includes` method, while the new code fragment does not negate the result. This means that the new code fragment would return `true` if the `text` variable is included in the `tmpUrl.text` string, while the original code fragment would return `false` in the same scenario.
