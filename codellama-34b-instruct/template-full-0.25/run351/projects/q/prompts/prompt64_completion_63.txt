  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function would delay the execution of the `flush` function by 1000 milliseconds, whereas the original code executed the `flush` function immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setInterval` function would execute the `flush` function every 1000 milliseconds, whereas the original code executed the `flush` function only once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setImmediate` function would execute the `flush` function immediately, whereas the original code executed the `flush` function after a delay of 1000 milliseconds.

DONE.
