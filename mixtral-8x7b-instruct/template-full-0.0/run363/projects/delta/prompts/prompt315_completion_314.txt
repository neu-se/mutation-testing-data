 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the length of the `ops` array in the current instance, rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max(...op)
