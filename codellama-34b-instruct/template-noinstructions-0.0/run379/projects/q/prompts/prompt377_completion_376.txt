  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `newValue` is used to propagate progress notifications, while `null` would not propagate any notifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `newValue` is used to propagate progress notifications, while `undefined` would not propagate any notifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `newValue` is used to propagate progress notifications, while `throw new Error("test")` would throw an error and not propagate any notifications.

DONE.
