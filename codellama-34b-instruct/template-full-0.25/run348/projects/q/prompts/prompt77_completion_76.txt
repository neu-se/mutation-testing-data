  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is a function that repeatedly calls a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds), while `setTimeout` is a function that calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout(flush, 1)` would call the `flush` function after 1 millisecond, while `setTimeout(flush, 0)` would call the `flush` function as soon as possible after the current thread of execution has been completed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout(flush, -1)` would call the `flush` function after -1 milliseconds, which would be a negative value and would likely result in an error.
