 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPending` function would always return false, regardless of the input's promise status.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPending` function would throw a TypeError when called with `null` as the input, as it checks if the input is an instance of Promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Proxy({}, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPending` function would return `false` when called with a Proxy object, even if it's a pending promise. The Proxy object intercepts the default behavior of the original object, so the `instanceof Promise` check would fail.

DONE.
