  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `array_map` function to skip over the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `array_map` function to iterate over the array in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable would be subtracted from the `index` variable, which would cause the `array_map` function to iterate over the array in the reverse order.

DONE.
