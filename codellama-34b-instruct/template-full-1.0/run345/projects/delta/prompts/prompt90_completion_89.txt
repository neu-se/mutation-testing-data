  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'string' && typeof lastOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because now the retain type is being checked for both newOp and lastOp.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'string' && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because now the delete type is being checked for newOp and the retain type is being checked for lastOp.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'object' && typeof lastOp.attributes === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because now the attributes type is being checked for both newOp and lastOp.

Please note that this is just a suggestion, and it's important to thoroughly evaluate the context and purpose of the code before making any changes to it.

DONE.
