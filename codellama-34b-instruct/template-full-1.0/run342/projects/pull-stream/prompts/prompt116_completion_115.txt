  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with `null` as the first argument, which is not the expected behavior. If an error occurs, the `cb` function should be called with the error as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not called with the `acc` variable as the second argument. If an error occurs, the `cb` function should be called with the error as the first argument and the `acc` variable as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with `null` as the second argument, which is not the expected behavior. If an error occurs, the `cb` function should be called with the error as the first argument and the `acc` variable as the second argument.

DONE.
