  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``` 
for (const verb of [])
```
This would result in a empty loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of ["Allow","Deny"])
```
This would result in only "Allow" and "Deny" get added to the `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of [...verbs])
```
This would result in a copy of `verbs` object, and only this copy get added to `this.verbs` object.

DONE
