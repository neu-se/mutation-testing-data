  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
```
This change replaces the original code fragment with a call to the `reducer` function, which is the intended behavior of the `reduce` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data
```
This change replaces the original code fragment with a simple assignment of the `data` variable to the `acc` variable, which is not the intended behavior of the `reduce` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = acc + data
```
This change replaces the original code fragment with an addition assignment of the `data` variable to the `acc` variable, which is not the intended behavior of the `reduce` function.

DONE.
