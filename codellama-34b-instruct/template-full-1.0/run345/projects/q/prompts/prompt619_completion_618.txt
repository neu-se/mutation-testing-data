  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```			
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "delete" method is different from the "get" method, and it would delete the property with the given key from the object instead of returning its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```		
"post", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "post" method is different from the "get" method, and it would post a message with the given key to the object instead of returning its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```		
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "set" method is different from the "get" method, and it would set the property with the given key to undefined instead of returning its value.

DONE.
