  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the `cb` variable, so the callback would only be called if `cb` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator only evaluates the second operand if the first operand is truthy, so the callback would only be called if `cb` is truthy and `false` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator only evaluates the second operand if the first operand is falsy, so the callback would only be called if `cb` is falsy or `true` is truthy.

DONE.
