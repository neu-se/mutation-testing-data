  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections` is a different array than `reportedUnhandledRejections`, and it would not have the same elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would not have any elements to search for, and the `array_indexOf` function would always return -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, and the `array_indexOf` function would throw an error when trying to access its `length` property.

DONE.
