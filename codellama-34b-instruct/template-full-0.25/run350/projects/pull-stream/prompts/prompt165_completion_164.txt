  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called with the `cb` function as its first argument, which is not the intended behavior. The `abortCb` function is designed to be called with the `abort` and `onAbort` arguments as its first and second arguments, respectively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called with an additional `true` argument, which is not expected. The `abortCb` function is designed to be called with only three arguments: `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the
