  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'error'` instead of `'drain'`, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'close'` instead of `'drain'`, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'end'` instead of `'drain'`, which could cause the application to behave differently.

DONE.
