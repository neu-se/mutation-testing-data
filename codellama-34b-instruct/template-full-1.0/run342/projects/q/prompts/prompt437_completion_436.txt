  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!array_indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `array_indexOf` function, which searches for the first occurrence of a value in an array. When the result is negated, the function would search for the first occurrence of a value that is not in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_includes` is a different function that checks if a value is included in an array, whereas `array_indexOf` checks if a value is at a specific index in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_findIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_findIndex` is a different function that searches for the first index of a value in an array that satisfies the provided predicate function, whereas `array_indexOf` searches for the first occurrence of a value in an array.

DONE.
