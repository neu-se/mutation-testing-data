  Option 1: The <PLACEHOLDER> can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because negating the value of `x` would change the direction of the bearing.

Option 2: The <PLACEHOLDER> can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the value of `y` would change the value of the bearing.

Option 3: The <PLACEHOLDER> can be replaced with:
```
Number(y) * 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying the value of `y` by 0.5 would change the value of the bearing.

DONE.
