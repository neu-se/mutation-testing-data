  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `!ended` is the logical negation of `ended`, which means that the code would return the opposite result of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because `ended && !end` is a different condition than `ended`, and it would cause the code to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a different variable than `ended`, and it would cause the code to return a different result.

DONE.
