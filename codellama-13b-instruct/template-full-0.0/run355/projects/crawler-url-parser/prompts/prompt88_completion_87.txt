  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the text content of the current element, while the new code fragment returns the trimmed text content of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the text content of the current element, while the new code fragment returns the text content of the current element without trimming it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the text content of the current element, while the new code fragment returns the uppercase text content of the current element.

DONE.
