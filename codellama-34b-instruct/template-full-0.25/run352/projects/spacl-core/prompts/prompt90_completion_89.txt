  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy` variable would be set to `null` instead of the expected `Policy` object, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` instead of the expected `boolean` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy` variable would be set to `undefined` instead of the expected `Policy` object, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` instead of the expected `boolean` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = new Policy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy` variable would be set to a new `Policy` object instead of the expected `Policy` object, which would cause the `query` method to return a different result than expected.

DONE.
