  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which is a truthy value, but `1 + 1` is a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which is a truthy value, but `2` is a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which is a truthy value, but `3` is a falsy value.

DONE.
