  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(regression)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regression` function is not defined in the code and would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(1 / 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1 / 0` expression would be evaluated as `Infinity` instead of `regression`, which would cause the `allSettled` function to return a rejected promise with a ` ReferenceError` instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as an argument to the `inspect` method instead of `regression`, which would cause the `allSettled` function to return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` instead of a fulfilled one.
