  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the value of `result`, whereas `when` would resolve the promise with the value of `result`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would reject the promise with the value of `result`, whereas `when` would resolve the promise with the value of `result`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would resolve the promise with the value of `result`, whereas `when` would resolve the promise with the value of `result`.

DONE.
