  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `timezonesMap` object instead of checking if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.hasOwnProperty('length')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `timezonesMap` object has a `length` property, which it does not have in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.keys().length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `timezonesMap` object's keys, which would be empty if the object is empty.

DONE.
