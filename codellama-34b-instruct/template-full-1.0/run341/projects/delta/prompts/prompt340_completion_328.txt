  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset used in the slice method would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset used in the slice method would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length, baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset used in the slice method would be different.

DONE.
