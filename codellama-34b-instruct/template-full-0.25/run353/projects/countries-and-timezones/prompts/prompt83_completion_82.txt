  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` returns a timezone object, while `getCountry` returns a country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getAllCountries
```
This would result in different behavior because `getAllCountries` returns an object with all countries, while `getCountry` returns a single country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getAllTimezones
```
This would result in different behavior because `getAllTimezones` returns an object with all timezones, while `getCountry` returns a single country object.

DONE.
