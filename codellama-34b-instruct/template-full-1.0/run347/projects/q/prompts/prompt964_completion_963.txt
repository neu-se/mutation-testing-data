  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{".q"}
```
This would result in different behavior because `.q` is not a valid keyword in JavaScript and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `return Q` would return the `Q` object, whereas the original code returns `this`, which is a reference to the object that the `delay` method belongs to.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid function and would cause an error when trying to use the resulting object as a function.

DONE.
