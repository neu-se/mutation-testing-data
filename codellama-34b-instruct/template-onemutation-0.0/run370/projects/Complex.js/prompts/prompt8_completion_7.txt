  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.abs()` function to ensure that the argument is positive, while the replaced code fragment does not have this check and could potentially result in a negative value being passed to `Math.log()`.
