  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.get(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return undefined, whereas `this.set(<PLACEHOLDER>, undefined, cb)` would set the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>` to undefined in the cache and potentially write it to disk depending on the value of `this.path`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>()
```
This would result in different behavior because `<PLACEHOLDER>()` would return undefined, whereas `this.set(<PLACEHOLDER>, undefined, cb)` would set the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>` to undefined in the cache and potentially write it to disk depending on the value of `this.path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior
