  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` operator is used to return undefined, which is different from null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` constant is used instead of the `void 0` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is changed from `void 0` to `null`.

DONE.
