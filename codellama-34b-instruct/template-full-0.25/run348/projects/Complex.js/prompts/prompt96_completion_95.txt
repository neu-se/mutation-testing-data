  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with an argument of `1`, which would cause the function to exit with a non-zero status code, indicating an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with an argument of `0`, which would cause the function to exit with a zero status code, indicating success.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with an argument of `2`, which would cause the function to exit with a status code of `2`, indicating a different type of error.

DONE.
