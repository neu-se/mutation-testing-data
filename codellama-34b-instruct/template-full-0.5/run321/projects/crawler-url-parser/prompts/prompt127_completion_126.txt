  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` property of the `linkurl` object would be used, which may not be the same as the `url` property that is used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property of the `linkurl` object would be used, which may not be the same as the `url` property that is used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property of the `linkurl` object would be used, which may not be the same as the `url` property that is used in the original code.

DONE.
