  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.baseurl` is a different property than `currentUrl.url`, and it may not be set in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol + "//" + currentUrl.host + currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would construct a URL string that is different from `currentUrl.url`, which may not be what the code is expecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.href` is a different property than `currentUrl.url`, and it may not be set in all cases.

DONE.
