  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring` would return a substring of the original word, whereas `w.substr` would return a portion of the original word starting from a specified position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice` would return a portion of the original word starting from a specified position, whereas `w.substr` would return a portion of the original word starting from a specified position and ending at a specified position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr(1)` would return a portion of the original word starting from the second position, whereas `w.substr` would return a portion of the original word starting from the first position.

DONE.
