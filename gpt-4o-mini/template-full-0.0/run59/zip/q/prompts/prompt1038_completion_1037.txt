Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` immediately resolves a promise with a value, whereas `Q.defer()` creates a deferred object that allows for manual resolution and rejection, which is essential for the queue's functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Queue closed"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a promise that is already rejected, which would prevent any further operations on the queue and lead to immediate failure when trying to get values from the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` would mean that `closed` is not a promise at all, leading to potential runtime errors when the code attempts to access properties or methods on `closed`, which would not be defined.

DONE.
