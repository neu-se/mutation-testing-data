  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.set` sets a new value for the key, whereas `urlMap.get` retrieves the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.has` checks if the key exists in the map, whereas `urlMap.get` retrieves the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.size` returns the number of key-value pairs in the map, whereas `urlMap.get` retrieves the value associated with the key.

DONE.
