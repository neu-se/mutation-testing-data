  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to receive one fewer argument than it expects, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to receive one more argument than it expects, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to receive three more arguments than it expects, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
