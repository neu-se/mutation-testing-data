  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the line number by 1, which could cause the code to reference the wrong line in the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the line number by 1, which could cause the code to reference the wrong line in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the line number, which could cause the code to reference the wrong line in the stack trace.

DONE.
