  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.concat(illnesses)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the `illnesses` array once, while the modified code fragment includes it twice, resulting in a different set of words being added to the `rules` array.
