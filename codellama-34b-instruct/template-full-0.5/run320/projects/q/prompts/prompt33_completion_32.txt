  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `runSingle` function would receive a null value as its first argument, which would cause it to throw an error when trying to invoke the null value as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `runSingle` function would receive an undefined value as its first argument, which would cause it to throw an error when trying to access a property on an undefined object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `runSingle` function would receive a number (0) as its first argument, which would cause it to throw an error when trying to invoke the number as a function.

DONE.
