  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + π
```
This would result in different behavior because a phase shift of π (180 degrees) would be applied to λ2, resulting in a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because a phase shift of π (180 degrees) would be applied to λ2, resulting in a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + sin(λ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because a phase shift of sin(λ2) would be applied to λ2, resulting in a different destination point.

DONE.
