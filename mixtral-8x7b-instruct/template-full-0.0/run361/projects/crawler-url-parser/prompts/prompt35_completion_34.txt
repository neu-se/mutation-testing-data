 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr || 'http://example.com', true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because if `currentUrlStr` is falsy, it will use a default URL instead of returning null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` options are set to `false`, disabling query string parsing and preserving the original case of URL components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse('https:' + currentUrlStr, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the protocol to be 'https:', which might not match the original `currentUrlStr` protocol.

These changes would help reveal potential weaknesses in the test suite by introducing different behaviors compared to the original code. DONE.
