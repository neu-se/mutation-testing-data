  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This would result in different behavior because if the rule's query method returns true, the code would return false instead of true, which would result in the opposite behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!res
```
This would result in different behavior because the exclamation mark would invert the boolean value of `res`, so if `res` was true, it would become false, and if it was false, it would become true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!res
```
This would result in different behavior because the double exclamation mark would coerce the value of `res` into a boolean, so if `res` was a truthy value, it would become true, and if it was a falsy value, it would become false.

DONE.
