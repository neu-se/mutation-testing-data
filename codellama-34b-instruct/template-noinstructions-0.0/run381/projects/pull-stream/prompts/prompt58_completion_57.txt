  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `done` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `done` is null. If `done` is null, the original code would still consider it falsy and execute the `if` block, while this new code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `done` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `done` is undefined. If `done` is undefined, the original code would still consider it falsy and execute the `if` block, while this new code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `done` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `done` is false. If `done` is false,
