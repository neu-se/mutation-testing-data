  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val, row.key
```
This change will cause the key and value to be swapped in the data object, which may cause issues if the code relies on the key-value pairs being in a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val + 1
```
This change will cause the value to be incremented by 1, which may cause issues if the code relies on the exact values being stored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val * 2
```
This change will cause the value to be doubled, which may cause issues if the code relies on the exact values being stored.

DONE.
