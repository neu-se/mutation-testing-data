  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` will cause the promise to be rejected, which is the opposite of the original code that was intended to resolve the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rejected promise, which would be different from the original code that was intended to resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `result`, which is not the same as the original code that was intended to resolve the promise with `rejection`.

DONE.
