  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the real part of the complex number, regardless of whether it is finite or infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a value that is one greater than the imaginary part of the complex number, regardless of whether it is finite or infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return infinity, regardless of whether the complex number is finite or infinite.

DONE.
