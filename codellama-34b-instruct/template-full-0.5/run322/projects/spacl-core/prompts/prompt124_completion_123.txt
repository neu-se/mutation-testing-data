  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `match` is `null`, while this new code fragment checks if `match` is not `null`. If `match` is not `null`, the new code fragment would return `false`, while the original code fragment would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `match` is `null`, while this new code fragment checks if `match` is an empty string. If `match` is an empty string, the new code fragment would return `true`, while the original code fragment would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `match` is `null`, while this new code fragment checks if `match` is a non-empty string. If `match`
