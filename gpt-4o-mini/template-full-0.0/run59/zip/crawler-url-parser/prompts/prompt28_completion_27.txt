Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/|^localhost/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly allows URLs that start with a single forward slash or are from the localhost domain, which should not be treated as absolute URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/|^(?!127\.0\.0\.1)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows URLs that start with a single forward slash or are from the IP address 127.0.0.1, which should also not be treated as absolute URLs, thus potentially leading to incorrect URL parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/|^(?!\w+:)./.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows any URL that starts with a single forward slash or any character followed by a colon, which would incorrectly classify many relative URLs as absolute, leading to parsing errors.

DONE.
