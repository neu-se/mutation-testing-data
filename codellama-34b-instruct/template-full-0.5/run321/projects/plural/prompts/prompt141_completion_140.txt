  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the `rule` array is a function, and passing `word` as an argument to that function would result in a different output than passing `word, rule[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0], word
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is a regular expression, and passing `word` as an argument to its `test()` method would result in a different output than passing `word, rule[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because concatenating `word` with `rule[0]` would result in a different output than passing `word, rule[0]` to the `replace()` method.

DONE.
