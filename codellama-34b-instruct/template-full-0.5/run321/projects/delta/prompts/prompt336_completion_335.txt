  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to return a different result when the `op.retain` property is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to return a different result when the `op.retain` property is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to return a different result when the `op.retain` property is null.

DONE.
