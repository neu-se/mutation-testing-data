  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the Delta to be 0, which is not the expected behavior for this code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the Delta to be NaN, which is not a valid number and would cause the program to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the Delta to be negative infinity, which is not a valid number and would cause the program to throw an error.

DONE.
