  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstLeft = firstOther.retain - firstLeft;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `firstLeft` variable would be reassigned with a different value, potentially causing the loop to terminate early or continue longer than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstLeft = firstOther.retain + firstLeft;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `firstLeft` variable would be reassigned with a different value, potentially causing the loop to terminate early or continue longer than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstLeft = firstOther.retain * firstLeft;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `firstLeft` variable would be reassigned with a different value, potentially causing the loop to terminate early or continue longer than intended.

DONE.
