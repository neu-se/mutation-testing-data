  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.finalize(false)` would prevent the actual finalization of the archive, resulting in a partial or corrupted archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(true, { force: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because `force: true` would force the archive to be finalized even if there are still files being added to the archive, resulting in a different archive content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(function(err) { console.log(err); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `finalize` would be called with an error object when finalization is finished, potentially resulting in different log output.

DONE.
