  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && this['isZero']
```
This code fragment checks if the complex number is both infinite and zero, which is a contradiction and will always return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] || this['isZero']
```
This code fragment checks if the complex number is either infinite or zero. If the number is infinite, the second condition will not be evaluated and the function will return Complex['ZERO']. If the number is zero, the first condition will not be evaluated and the function will return Complex['INFINITY'].

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite'] && !this['isZero']
```
This code fragment checks if the complex number is neither infinite nor zero. If the number is infinite, the second condition will not be evaluated and the function will return Complex['ZERO']. If the number is zero, the first condition will not be evaluated and the function will return Complex['
