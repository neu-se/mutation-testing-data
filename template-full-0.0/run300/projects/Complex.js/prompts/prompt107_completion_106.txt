  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with both real and imaginary parts set to NaN, while this code returns a single value of NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with both real and imaginary parts set to Infinity, while this code returns a single value of Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with both real and imaginary parts set to NaN, while this code returns a single value of NaN.

DONE.
