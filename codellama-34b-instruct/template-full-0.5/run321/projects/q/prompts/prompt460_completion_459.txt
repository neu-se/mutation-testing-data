  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator will always return `true` if `at` is a positive number, whereas the `!==` operator would return `false` if `at` is a positive number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator will always return `true` if `at` is a negative number, whereas the `!==` operator would return `false` if `at` is a negative number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator will return `true` if `at` is equal to `-1`, whereas the `!==` operator would return `false` if `at` is equal to `-1`.

DONE.
