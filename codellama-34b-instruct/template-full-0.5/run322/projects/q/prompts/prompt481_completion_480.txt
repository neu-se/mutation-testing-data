  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the `at` index, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to remove the wrong element from the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `at` index, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to remove the wrong element from the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 2 from the `at` index, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to remove the wrong element from the `unhandledReasons` array.

DONE.
