  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the real part of the complex number is zero, rather than if the imaginary part is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `false` if the imaginary part of the complex number is not zero, rather than if it is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the real part of the complex number is less than zero, rather than if the imaginary part is zero.

DONE.
