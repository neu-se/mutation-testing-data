  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
}).catch(() => {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only throws the reason when `callback.fcall()` is rejected, while the modified code always throws the reason after calling `callback.fcall()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
}).then(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only throws the reason when `callback.fcall()` is rejected, while the modified code always throws the reason after calling `callback.fcall()`.
