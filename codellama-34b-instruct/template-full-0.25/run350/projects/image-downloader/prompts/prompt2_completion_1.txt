  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise. In this case, the function would return a resolved promise with the error message as its value, which may not be desirable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all of the input promises have resolved. In this case, the function would return a promise that resolves with an array containing the error message, which may not be desirable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.race` takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves or rejects when any of the input promises have resolved or rejected. In this case, the function would return a promise
