  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the array, rather than the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the array, rather than the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the specified number of elements from the array, starting from the given index.

DONE.
