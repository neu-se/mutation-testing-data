  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', 'foo');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'write_close' event without any arguments, while the new code emits the event with the argument 'foo'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._data);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'write_close' event without any arguments, while the new code emits the event with the argument `this._data`, which is an object that contains the data stored in the dirty database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'write_close' event without any arguments, while the new code emits the event with the argument `this._writeStream`, which is a writable stream that is used to write data to the dirty database
