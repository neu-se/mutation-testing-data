  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the original condition was `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `1` to the value of `embedType`, potentially causing it to be different from the value returned by `Object.keys(otherData)[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(otherData)[0] - embedType === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the value of `embedType` from the first element of the array returned by `Object.keys(otherData)`, potentially causing the result to be different from the original condition.

DONE.
