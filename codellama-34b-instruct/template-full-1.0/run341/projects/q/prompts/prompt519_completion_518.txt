  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```deferred.reject```
This would result in different behavior because `.reject` is a different method than `.notify`, which could potentially cause unintended consequences in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```deferred.get(null)```
This would result in different behavior because `.get(null)` is a different method than `.notify`, which could potentially cause unintended consequences in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```deferred.post(null, false)```
This would result in different behavior because `.post(null, false)` is a different method than `.notify`, which could potentially cause unintended consequences in the code.

DONE.
