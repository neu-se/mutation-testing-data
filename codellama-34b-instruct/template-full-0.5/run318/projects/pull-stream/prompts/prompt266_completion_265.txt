  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `if (err === true)` block to be skipped, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb(err)` line to be called with `null` as the error argument, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb(err)` line to be called with `data` as the error argument, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
