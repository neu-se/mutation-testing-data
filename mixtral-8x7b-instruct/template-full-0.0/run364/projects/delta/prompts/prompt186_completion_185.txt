 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the exact value of `undefined` instead of using the loose equality check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(thisOp).includes('retain')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'retain' property exists in the 'thisOp' object, rather than checking its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof thisOp.retain !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `typeof` operator to check if 'retain' is not `undefined`, which is a more explicit way of checking for the existence of a property.

DONE.
