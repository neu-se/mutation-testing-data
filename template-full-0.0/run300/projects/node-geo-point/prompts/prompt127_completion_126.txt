  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the `point` object instead of the latitude, which could cause the `calculateDistance` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude of the `point` object, which could cause the `calculateDistance` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the longitude of the `point` object by 2, which could cause the `calculateDistance` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
