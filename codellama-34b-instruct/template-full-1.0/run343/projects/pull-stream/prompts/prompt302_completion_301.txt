  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
            read(false, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is called with `false` instead of `null`, which may cause the function to behave differently when it encounters a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
            read(true, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is called with `true` instead of `null`, which may cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
            read(ended, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is called with the value of `ended` instead of `null`, which may cause the function to return a different value or behave differently when it encounters a falsy value.

DONE.
