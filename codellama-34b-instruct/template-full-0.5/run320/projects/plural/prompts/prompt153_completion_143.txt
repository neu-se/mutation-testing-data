  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"this"
```
This would result in different behavior because "this" is a string, while the original code fragment refers to the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + num
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not perform any arithmetic operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not perform any arithmetic operations.

DONE.
