  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would not be called, and the code would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would not be called, and the code would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would not be called, and the code would not be executed.

DONE.
