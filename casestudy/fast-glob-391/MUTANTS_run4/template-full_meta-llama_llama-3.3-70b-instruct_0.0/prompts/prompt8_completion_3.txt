Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
positive
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the positive patterns for the negative filter, which could lead to incorrect filtering results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
negative, this._micromatchOptions
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not override the `dot` property of the `micromatchOptions` to `true`, potentially affecting the matching of dot files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not convert any negative patterns to regular expressions, effectively disabling the negative filtering.

DONE.
