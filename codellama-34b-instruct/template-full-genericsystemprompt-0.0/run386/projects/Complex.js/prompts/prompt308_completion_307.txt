  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square of the real part of the complex number, rather than the square of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of the square of the imaginary part of the complex number, rather than simply squaring the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the result of the square of the imaginary part of the complex number, rather than simply squaring the imaginary part.

DONE.
