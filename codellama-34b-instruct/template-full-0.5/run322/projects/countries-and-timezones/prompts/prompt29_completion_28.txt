  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses integer division to calculate the number of hours, while the new code fragment uses modulo to calculate the number of minutes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 60.0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses integer division to calculate the number of hours, while the new code fragment uses floating-point division to calculate the number of hours.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 60 + 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses integer division to calculate the number of hours, while the new code fragment uses floating-point division and adds 0.5 to the result.

DONE.
