  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the deferred promise with the value returned by the function, while the modified code fragment resolves the deferred promise with the value passed as an argument to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the deferred promise with the exception thrown by the function, while the modified code fragment rejects the deferred promise with the exception passed as an argument to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment notifies the deferred promise with the value returned by the function, while the modified code fragment notifies the deferred promise with the value passed as an argument to the function.

DONE.
