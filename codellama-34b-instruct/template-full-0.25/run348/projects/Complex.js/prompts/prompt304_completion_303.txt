  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `a`, potentially causing the `atan` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `b`, potentially causing the `atan` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operation would change the value of `a` and `b`, potentially causing the `atan` function to return a different result.

DONE.
