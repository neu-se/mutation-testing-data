  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it case-insensitive. This means that the regular expression will match both uppercase and lowercase letters, which may cause the test to fail if the input string contains uppercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it global. This means that the regular expression will match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now a literal string, rather than a regular expression. This means that the test will fail if the input string contains any of the characters `x
