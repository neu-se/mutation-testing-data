  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the current data item being processed, while `data + 1` would be a reference to the next data item.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the current data item being processed, while `data.length` would be a reference to the length of the current data item.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the current data item being processed, while `data[0]` would be a reference to the first element of the current data item.

DONE.
