  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return undefined;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error instead of being resolved with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error instead of being resolved with the original value, and it would use the `Q.reject` method to create the rejection instead of `throw`.

DONE.
