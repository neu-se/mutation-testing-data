 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inspected.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison is now checking for the opposite of "fulfilled" instead of "rejected". This means that the `_rejected` function will be called not only when the promise is rejected but also when it is fulfilled, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inspected.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.reason` property is only defined when the promise is rejected. Therefore, this comparison will always evaluate to `true` when the promise is fulfilled, causing the `_rejected` function to be called instead of the `_fulfilled` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison is now checking for the "pending" state instead of "rejected". This means that the
