  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of the array, whereas `concat()` returns a new array with the elements of the original array followed by the elements of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.splice(0, 0, other.ops[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice()` method modifies the original array by inserting the elements of the argument at the specified index, whereas `concat()` returns a new array with the elements of the original array followed by the elements of the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.push(other.ops[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push()` method adds one or more elements to the end of the array, whereas `concat()` returns a new array with the elements of the original array followed by the elements of the argument.
