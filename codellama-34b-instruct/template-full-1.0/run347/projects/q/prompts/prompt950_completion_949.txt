  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` is a reference to the `Q` object, but `null` would cause the function to be bound to the global object instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` is a reference to the `Q` object, but `undefined` would cause the function to be bound to the global object instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` is a reference to the `Q` object, but `{}` would cause the function to be bound to an empty object instead.

DONE.
