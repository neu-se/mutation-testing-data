  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to replace the matched substring with `'ves'`, while this code fragment uses the `replace` method to replace the matched substring with `'ves'`, but also removes the last character of the word (the `substr` method is used to remove the last character).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the word and add `'ies'`, while this code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the word and add `'ies'`, but also removes the last character of the word (the `substr` method is used to remove the last character).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return w.substr(0,
