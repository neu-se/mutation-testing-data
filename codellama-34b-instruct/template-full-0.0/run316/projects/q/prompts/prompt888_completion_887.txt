  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `nfapply` method to be called with an array of arguments, while the new code fragment would cause it to be called with a single argument of `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `nfapply` method to be called with an array of arguments, while the new code fragment would cause it to be called with a single argument of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `nfapply` method to be called with an array of arguments, while the new code fragment would cause it to be called with a single argument of `undefined`.

DONE.
