  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` instead of a promise that resolves to an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` instead of a promise that resolves to an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a promise that resolves to an empty array instead of a promise that resolves to an array of values.

DONE.
