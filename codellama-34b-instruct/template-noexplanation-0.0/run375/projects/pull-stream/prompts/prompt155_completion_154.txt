  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This code fragment is the same as the original code fragment, and it has the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, abort
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it has a different order of arguments. This change should not affect the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort, null
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment, as it adds an extra argument `null` to the end of the argument list. This change should cause the code to behave differently, as the extra argument may be passed to the `cb` function, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
