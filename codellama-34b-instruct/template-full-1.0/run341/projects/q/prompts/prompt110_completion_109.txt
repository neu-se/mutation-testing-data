  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is now `!==` instead of `===` which means it would return `true` if the items are not equal, whereas the original code would return `true` if the items are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] + value
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is now `+` instead of `===` which means it would return the sum of `this[i]` and `value`, whereas the original code would return `true` if the items are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof this[i] === value
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is now `typeof` instead of `===` which means it would return the type of `this[i]` as a string, whereas the original code would return `true` if the item has the same type as `value`.

DONE.
