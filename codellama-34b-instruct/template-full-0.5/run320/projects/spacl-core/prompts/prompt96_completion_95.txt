  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to `null` instead of the `policy` object, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` for any policy name, even if the policy exists in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to the policy name instead of the `policy` object, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` for any policy name that does not match the name of the policy in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, this.get(policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to the result of the `get` method called on the map with the policy name as the argument, which would cause the `query` method to return `
