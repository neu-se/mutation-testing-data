  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a minus sign before `Math.cos(a)`, which changes the sign of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a multiplication by 2 before `Math.cos(a)`, which changes the scale of the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cnMath.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a multiplication by the complex number `c` before `Math.cos(a)`, which changes the magnitude and phase of the result.

DONE.
