  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would make it match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would make it case-insensitive, so it would match both "index.html" and "INDEX.HTML".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match any string that ends with "/index." followed by any number of lowercase letters, not just "index.html".

DONE.
