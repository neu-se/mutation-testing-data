 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i === value
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the index and the value using `===` instead of accessing the array element with `this[i]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this[i] !== value
