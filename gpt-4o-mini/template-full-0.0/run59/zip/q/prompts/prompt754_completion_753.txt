Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context from the current promise (`this`) to the entire array of promises, which would lead to incorrect handling of the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `this` would cause the method to operate on a non-existent promise, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior when trying to resolve or reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would similarly cause the method to operate on an undefined value, which would not trigger the expected promise resolution or rejection logic.

DONE.
