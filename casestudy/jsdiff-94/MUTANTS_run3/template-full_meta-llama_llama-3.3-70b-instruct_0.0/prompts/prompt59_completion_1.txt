Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(!oldEOFNewline && noNlBeforeAdds) || newEOFNewline
```
This would result in different behavior because the logic of the conditional statement is inverted, potentially adding the 'No newline at end of file' marker in incorrect situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline && !newEOFNewline
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the old file has a newline at the end and the new file does not, which can lead to incorrect handling of newline markers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline || newEOFNewline
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the 'No newline at end of file' marker whenever either the old or new file has a newline at the end, which is opposite to the intended behavior of marking the absence of a newline.

DONE.
