  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest + '1' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dest` variable is modified, causing the file to be written to a different location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'new_file.txt' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the file is written to a different file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the file is not written to a file name, causing an error.

DONE.
