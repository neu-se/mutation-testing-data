  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolvedPromise` variable is initialized to `undefined`, and the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality. In this case, `undefined` would not be considered equal to `null`, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a rejected promise, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolvedPromise` variable is initialized to `undefined`, and the `!==` operator checks for value inequality. In this case, `undefined` would be considered unequal to `undefined`, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a resolved promise, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` property of the `resol
