 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.callee.caller.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the arguments of the outer function, not the array_slice function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the arguments with null, causing an error in the array\_reduce function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the arguments with a function, causing an error in the array\_reduce function.

DONE.
