  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is not a valid event listener method, and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.addEventListener('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.addEventListener` is not a valid method, and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.on` is not a valid method, and would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
