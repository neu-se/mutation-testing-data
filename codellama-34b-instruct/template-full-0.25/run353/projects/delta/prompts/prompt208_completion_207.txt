  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument of 1, which would remove the first element of the `ops` array, rather than the last element as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument of -1, which would remove the last element of the `ops` array, rather than the first element as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument of 0, which would remove the first element of the `ops` array, but would not remove any other elements.

DONE.
