 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always resolve to an empty promise instead of the inspection result of the input promise. This is because `Promise.resolve()` creates a new resolved promise, while the original code fragment uses the same promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always resolve to the value of the current promise in the iteration instead of the inspection result of the input promise. This is because `promises[index]` directly accesses the promise in the array, while the original code fragment wraps it in a function call to ensure the promise is properly handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always resolve to a new promise that wraps the input promise, instead of the inspection result of the input promise
