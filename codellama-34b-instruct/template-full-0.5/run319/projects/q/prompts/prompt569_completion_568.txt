  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would not be called if the `result` value is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would not be called if the `result` value is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would be called if the `result` value is `true`.

DONE.
