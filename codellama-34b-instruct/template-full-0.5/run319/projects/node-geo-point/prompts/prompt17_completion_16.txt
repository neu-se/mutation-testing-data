  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` modifies the original array, which could cause unexpected results if the code relies on the original order of the coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a new array without the first element, which could cause the code to miss important information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.concat([0, 0])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` adds new elements to the end of the array, which could cause the code to interpret the coordinates incorrectly.

DONE.
