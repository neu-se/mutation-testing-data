  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.stackCounter` is a number, and `promise.stack` is a string, so the concatenation would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.stack.length` is a number, and `promise.stack` is a string, so the concatenation would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack.split("\n")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.stack.split("\n")[0]` is the first line of the stack trace, and `promise.stack` is the entire stack trace, so the concatenation would produce a different result.

DONE.
