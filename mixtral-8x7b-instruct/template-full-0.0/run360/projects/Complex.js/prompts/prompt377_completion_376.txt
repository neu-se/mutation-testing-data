 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the result when the input is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a) - Math.exp(-a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it does not handle the imaginary part of the input, leading to incorrect results for complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(2 * a) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it only considers the real part of the input, leading to incorrect results for complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts.

DONE.
