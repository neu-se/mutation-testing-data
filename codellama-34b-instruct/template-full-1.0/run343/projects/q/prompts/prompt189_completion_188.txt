  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"NaN"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `getFileNameAndLineNumber` to return `(undefined, undefined)`, making the subsequent call to `isInternalFrame` always return `false`, potentially causing some stack frames to be missed in the filtered stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Infinity"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `getFileNameAndLineNumber` to return `(undefined, undefined)`, making the subsequent call to `isInternalFrame` always return `false`, potentially causing some stack frames to be missed in the filtered stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"-%Infinity%"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for `isInternalFrame`, potentially causing some stack frames to be missed in the filtered stack trace.

DONE.
