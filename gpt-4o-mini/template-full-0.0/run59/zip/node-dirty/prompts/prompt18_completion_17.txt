Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the list of callbacks with the number of callbacks, which would not be callable and would lead to errors when trying to execute them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the queue for the key to `null`, effectively losing all callbacks associated with that key and preventing them from being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the list of callbacks with only the first callback, meaning that any additional callbacks for that key would be ignored and not executed.

DONE.
