  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing `null` as the error argument, `undefined` would be passed. This could cause the function to be interpreted as having no errors, even if there were errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing `null` as the error argument, `true` would be passed. This could cause the function to be interpreted as having an error, even if there were no errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function() { cb(null, data); }, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the callback function immediately, it would be called after a delay of 1 second. This could cause the function to be interpreted as being async, even if it was not intended to be.

DONE.
