 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately invoke the `peekType` method and pass its return value, instead of using the function itself as a predicate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `peekType` method from the `thisIter` object, instead of the `otherIter` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'insert'
