Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would initialize `prev` to an empty object if it is falsy, potentially leading to unexpected results when merging country data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) });
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object instead of modifying `prev`, which may lead to issues if the original `prev` object is expected to be updated in place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[id] = getCountry(id, options);
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly mutates the `prev` object instead of returning a new object, which could lead to side effects if `prev` is used elsewhere in the code.

DONE.
