  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the attributes of the current operation, without taking into account the attributes of the base operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the attributes of the base operation, without taking into account the attributes of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes || baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the attributes of both the current operation and the base operation, but would not handle conflicts between the two.

DONE.
