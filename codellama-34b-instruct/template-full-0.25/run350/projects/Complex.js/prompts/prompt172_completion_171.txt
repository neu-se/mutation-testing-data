  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks if a value is NaN, while `isInfinite()` checks if a value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite()` checks if a value is finite, while `isInfinite()` checks if a value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, so `!z['isInfinite']` would be true if `z` is not infinite, while `z['isInfinite']` would be true if `z` is infinite.

DONE.
