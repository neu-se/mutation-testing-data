  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` object does not accept `null` as a key. Instead, it would throw a `TypeError` if `null` is used as a key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` object does not accept `undefined` as a key. Instead, it would throw a `TypeError` if `undefined` is used as a key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` object does not accept an empty string as a key. Instead, it would throw a `TypeError` if an empty string is used as a key.

DONE.
