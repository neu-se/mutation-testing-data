Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.size())
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the size of the data map instead of the value associated with the key, which would lead to incorrect updates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key) + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the current value instead of applying the updater function, potentially leading to unintended modifications of numeric values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` to the updater function instead of the current value, which may cause the updater to behave incorrectly or throw an error if it expects a valid value.

DONE.
