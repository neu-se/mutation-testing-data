  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `read`, which could potentially cause the function to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `read`, which could potentially cause the function to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `read`, which could potentially cause the function to return a different value than expected.

DONE.
