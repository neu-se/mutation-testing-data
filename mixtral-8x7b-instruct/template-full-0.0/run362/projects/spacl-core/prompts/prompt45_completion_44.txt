 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.search(/:.+/) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first match, while `match` returns an array of matches or `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/:./.test(part)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` returns a boolean indicating if there is a match, while `match` returns an array of matches or `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.includes(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if a string contains a substring, while `match` checks if a string matches a regular expression.

DONE.
