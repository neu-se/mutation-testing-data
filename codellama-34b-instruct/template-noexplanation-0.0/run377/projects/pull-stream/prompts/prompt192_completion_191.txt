  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map + 1
```
This change will cause the `map` function to be called with an incorrect argument, which may cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map - 1
```
This change will cause the `map` function to be called with an incorrect argument, which may cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map * 2
```
This change will cause the `map` function to be called with an incorrect argument, which may cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
