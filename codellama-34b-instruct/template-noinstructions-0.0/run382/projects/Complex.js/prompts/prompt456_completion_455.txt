  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] !== 0 || this['im'] !== 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is not on the Riemann sphere, while this new code fragment checks if the real or imaginary part is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is not on the Riemann sphere, while this new code fragment checks if the real and imaginary parts are both equal to zero.
