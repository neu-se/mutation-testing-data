  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both "pending" and "rejected" states, while this replacement only checks for "fulfilled" state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both "pending" and "rejected" states, while this replacement only checks for "rejected" state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending" && inspected.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both "pending" and "rejected" states, while this replacement only checks for "pending" state and checks if the value is undefined.

DONE.
