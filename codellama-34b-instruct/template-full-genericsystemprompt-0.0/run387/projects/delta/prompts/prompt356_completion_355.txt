  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would be called with an offset of 1, which could cause the method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would be called with an offset of -1, which could cause the method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would be called with an offset of 2, which could cause the method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
