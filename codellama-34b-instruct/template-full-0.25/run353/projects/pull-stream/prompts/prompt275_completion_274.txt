  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stream to be piped to the standard output, whereas the original code fragment would not have any effect on the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stderr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stream to be piped to the standard error, whereas the original code fragment would not have any effect on the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stream to be piped to a null destination, whereas the original code fragment would not have any effect on the stream.

DONE.
