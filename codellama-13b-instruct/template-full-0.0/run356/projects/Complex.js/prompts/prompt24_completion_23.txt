  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function returns the absolute value of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function returns the value of a number raised to a power, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.log` function returns the natural logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

DONE.
