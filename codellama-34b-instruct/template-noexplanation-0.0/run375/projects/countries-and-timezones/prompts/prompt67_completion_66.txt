  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = options
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to always return the `options` object, regardless of the `id` parameter. This will likely cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code that relies on the `getCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = null
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to always return `null`, regardless of the `id` parameter. This will likely cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code that relies on the `getCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = { ...options }
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return a new object that is a shallow copy of the `options` object, regardless of the `id` parameter. This will likely cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code that relies on the `getCountry` function.
