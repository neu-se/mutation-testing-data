  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment ` 'criterion' ` is used as a rule to pluralize the word, whereas the new code fragment ` 'criterions' ` would be a new rule.

Option 2:The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment ` 'criterion' ` is used as a rule to pluralize the word, whereas the new code fragment ` 'criteria' ` would be a new rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteria'},
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment ` 'criterion' ` is used as a rule to pluralize the word, whereas the new code fragment ` 'criteria'},` would be a new rule.

DONE.
