  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "foo" to the page URL path, which would cause the `includes()` method to always return false, even if the link URL path contains the page URL path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the page URL path, which would cause the `includes()` method to always return false, even if the link URL path contains the page URL path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of the page URL path starting from the second character, which would cause the `includes()` method to always return false, even if the link URL path contains the page URL path.

DONE.
