Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` would be set to `null`, causing a TypeError when the `then` method tries to invoke `callback.fcall(value)` since `null` does not have a `fcall` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return "error"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` would now be a function that always returns the string "error", which would not allow the original value to be passed through, potentially leading to unexpected results in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `callback` to `undefined` would lead to a similar TypeError when trying to call `callback.fcall(value)`, as `undefined` does not have a `fcall` method, breaking the promise chain.

DONE.
