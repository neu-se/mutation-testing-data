Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of `sinφ2`, which relies on `sinφ1`, leading to incorrect latitude calculations in the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively ignores the original latitude of the coordinate, resulting in a constant latitude for the destination point regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the original latitude by adding 1 radian, which would lead to incorrect calculations for the destination point's latitude.

DONE.
