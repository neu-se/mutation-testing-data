  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the trimmed text content of the element, rather than the trimmed value of the "text" attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr("text").trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the trimmed value of the "text" attribute, rather than the trimmed text content of the element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text(someNewValue).trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the text content of the element to `someNewValue`, and then return the trimmed text content of the element.

DONE.
