  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` has a different syntax and purpose than `push`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is used to concatenate two deltas together, while `push` is used to add an operation to a delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is used to replace an operation in a delta, while `push` is used to add an operation to a delta.

DONE.
