 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `point2Rad` variable with a constant value of 1, causing the `b` calculation to always be a small positive number, which would affect the distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
