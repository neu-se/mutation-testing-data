  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of an object, while this code checks for the presence of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of an object, while this code checks for the presence of a non-null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of an object, while this code checks for the presence of a defined value.

DONE.
