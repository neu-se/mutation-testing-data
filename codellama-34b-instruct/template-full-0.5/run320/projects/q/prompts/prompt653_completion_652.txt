  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a different array, potentially causing the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a different array, potentially causing the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a different array, potentially causing the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
