  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc + data` would perform addition instead of concatenation, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc - data` would perform subtraction instead of concatenation, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc * data` would perform multiplication instead of concatenation, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
