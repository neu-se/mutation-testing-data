  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.bind(process)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit.bind(process)` is a bound function, which would change the value of `this` inside the `emit` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit.toString()` would return a string representation of the `emit` function, which would be different from the original behavior of calling the `emit` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.apply(process)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit.apply(process)` would call the `emit` function with `process` as the `this` value, which would change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
