  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb]()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` at the end of the line would cause the generator to be executed immediately, rather than being passed as a value to the `continuer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` at the end of the line would cause the generator to be executed with the `arg` value as its argument, rather than being passed as a value to the `continuer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` and `errback` functions at the end of the line would cause the generator to be executed with the `callback` and `errback` functions as its arguments, rather than being passed as values to the `continuer` function.

DONE.
