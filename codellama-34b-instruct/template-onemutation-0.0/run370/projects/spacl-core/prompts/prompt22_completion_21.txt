  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on the `string` argument, which would cause the matcher to match the substring of the input string starting from the second character, rather than the entire input string.

DONE.
