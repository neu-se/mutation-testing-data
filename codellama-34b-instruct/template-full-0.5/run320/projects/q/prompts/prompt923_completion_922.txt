  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected even if the callback succeeds, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the callback, even if the callback fails, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the result of the callback, even if the callback succeeds, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
