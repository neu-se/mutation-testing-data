  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because "fulfilled" is a different string than "promise", and it would cause the code to enter a different branch of the if-else statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because "rejected" is a different string than "promise", and it would cause the code to enter a different branch of the if-else statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because "pending" is a different string than "promise", and it would cause the code to enter a different branch of the if-else statement.

DONE.
