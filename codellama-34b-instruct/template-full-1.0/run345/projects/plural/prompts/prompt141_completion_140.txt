  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is a regular expression object, and `+` operator on a regular expression object concatenates the regular expression pattern with the string. In this case, it would concatenate the regular expression pattern with the input word, which would result in an incorrect pattern match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1]` is a function object, and calling a function object without arguments would return a new function object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word - rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `-` operator on a regular expression object would remove all matches of the regular expression pattern from the input string. In this case, it would remove the entire input string, which would result in an incorrect pattern match.

DONE.
