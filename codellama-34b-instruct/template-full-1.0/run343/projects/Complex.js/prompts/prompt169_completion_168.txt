  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']() && this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the two conditions are combined using a logical AND operator, while the original code fragment uses a logical OR operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the two conditions are combined using a logical AND operator, while the original code fragment uses a logical OR operator. Additionally, the condition for `this` is inverted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']() || this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the two conditions are combined using a logical OR operator, while the original code fragment uses a logical AND operator.

DONE.
