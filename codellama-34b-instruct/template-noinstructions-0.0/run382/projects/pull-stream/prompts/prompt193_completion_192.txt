  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `aborted` variable, causing the `cb(aborted)` call to be skipped when `aborted` is truthy, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the expression and returns `false` when `aborted` is truthy, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the expression and returns `true` when `aborted` is falsy, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
