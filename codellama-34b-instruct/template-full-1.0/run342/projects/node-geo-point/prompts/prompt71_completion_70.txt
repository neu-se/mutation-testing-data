  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the initial bearing between two points, while this modified code calculates the final bearing after the second point has been reached.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the initial bearing between two points, while this modified code calculates the double of the initial bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the initial bearing between two points, while this modified code calculates the half of the initial bearing.

DONE.
