  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for read access, while this code is checking for write access.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for read access, while this code is checking for execute access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for read access, while this code is checking for existence.

DONE.
