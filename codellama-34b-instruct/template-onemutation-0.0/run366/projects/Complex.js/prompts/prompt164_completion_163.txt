  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is zero, while the new code fragment checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is zero, which is a stricter condition and may cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
