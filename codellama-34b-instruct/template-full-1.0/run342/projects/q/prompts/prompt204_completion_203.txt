  Option 1: The buggy code fragment that can be used to replace the placeholder is:

```
function(firstLine) {
    return firstLine.split(/[@:]/)[1];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the filename and line number information from the stack trace, which would make it difficult to identify the location of the error.

Option 2: The buggy code fragment that can be used to replace the placeholder is:

```
function(firstLine) {
    return firstLine.split(/[@:])[1] * 2;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the line number information in the stack trace, which would cause the error to be reported at a different location than the actual source of the error.

Option 3: The buggy code fragment that can be used to replace the placeholder is:

```
function(firstLine) {
    return firstLine.split(/[@:)])[1].split("-")[0];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first part of the file
