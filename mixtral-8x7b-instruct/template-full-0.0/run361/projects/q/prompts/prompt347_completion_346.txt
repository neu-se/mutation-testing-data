 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if the `rejected` parameter is a function, while `true` always evaluates to a truthy value, causing the `makeStackTraceLong` function to be called unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if the `rejected` parameter is a function, while `1 < 2` is always true, causing the code to skip the `makeStackTraceLong` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if the `rejected` parameter is a function, while this replacement checks if it is not a function, causing the `makeStackTraceLong` function to be skipped.

DONE.
