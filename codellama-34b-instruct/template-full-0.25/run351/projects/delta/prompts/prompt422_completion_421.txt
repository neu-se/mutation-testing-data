  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the result, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract 1 from the result, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the offset to the index, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
