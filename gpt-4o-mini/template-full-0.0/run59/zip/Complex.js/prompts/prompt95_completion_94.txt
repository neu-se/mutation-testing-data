Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the value of `c` by adding 1, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the complex number, especially if `c` is expected to be a numeric value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies `c` by 2, which changes the intended value being parsed and could lead to incorrect results when constructing the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because dividing by zero will produce `Infinity` in JavaScript, which could cause unexpected behavior in subsequent calculations involving the complex number.

DONE.
