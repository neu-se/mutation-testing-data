  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the `basis` variable would cause the `reduce` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the `basis` variable would cause the `reduce` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the `basis` variable would cause the `reduce` function to return a different value.

DONE.
