 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function call would throw a TypeError, as it expects an array-like object as its first argument. The original `array_slice` function is called with the `arguments` object, which is array-like but not an actual array. Replacing it with `null` would cause a TypeError, which would not be caught by the existing tests if they don't check for such exceptions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` returns a function that operates on arrays, not the `arguments` object. The original `array_slice` function is called with the `arguments` object, which is array-like but not an actual array. Replacing it with `[].slice` would cause the code to operate incorrectly on the `arguments` object, which would not be caught by the existing tests if they don't check for such misbehavior.
