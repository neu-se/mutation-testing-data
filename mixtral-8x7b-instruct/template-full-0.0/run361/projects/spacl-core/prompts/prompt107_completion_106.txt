 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'/random/path'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always check if the policy matches a specific path, regardless of the input path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(Math.random() * 10).toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random number as the path, making the matches function unpredictable and dependent on the random value generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ctx?.path || '/default/path'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the path from the context if available, but if not, it would default to a specific path, which might not match the actual path provided in the input.

DONE.
