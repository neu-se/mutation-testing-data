  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with real and imaginary parts, while this replacement returns a single value of infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with real and imaginary parts, while this replacement returns a complex number with both parts equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(1, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with real and imaginary parts, while this replacement returns a complex number with real part equal to one and imaginary part equal to zero.

DONE.
