  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would be called with `recursive` set to `true`, which would include all subdirectories and their contents in the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, { exclude: ['**/*.js'] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would be called with `recursive` set to `false`, which would only include the files in the top-level directory, and the `exclude` option would exclude all files with the `.js` extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, { include: ['**/*.js'] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would be called with `recursive` set to `false`, which would only include the files in the top-level directory, and the `include` option would only include files with the `.js` extension.
