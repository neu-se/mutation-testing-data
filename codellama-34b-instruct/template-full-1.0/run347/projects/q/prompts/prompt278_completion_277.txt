  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise with no value, which may not be intentional.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with no reason, which may not be intentional.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately notify the promise with no progress, which may not be intentional.

DONE.
