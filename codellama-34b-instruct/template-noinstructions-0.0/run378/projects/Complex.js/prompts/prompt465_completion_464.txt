  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is being modified, which could cause the `equals` method to return `false` even if the two complex numbers are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is being multiplied by 2, which could cause the `equals` method to return `false` even if the two complex numbers are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is being subtracted by 1, which could cause the `equals` method to return `false` even if the two complex numbers are equal.

DONE.
