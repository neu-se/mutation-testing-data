  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a file path, while this new code fragment is a file path with a hardcoded '.json' extension. This would cause the `writeFileSync` function to write to a different file than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace('.json', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a file path, while this new code fragment is a file path with a hardcoded '.json' extension removed. This would cause the `writeFileSync` function to write to a different file than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace('.json', '.txt')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a file path, while this new code fragment is a file path with a hardcoded '.json' extension replaced with '.txt'. This would cause the `writeFileSync` function to write
