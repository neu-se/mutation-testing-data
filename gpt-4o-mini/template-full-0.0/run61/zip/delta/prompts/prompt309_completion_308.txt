Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the current operation into the `line` Delta even if the line is not complete, potentially causing incorrect line segmentation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line = new Delta(this.ops);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly initialize `line` with the current Delta's operations instead of starting a new empty Delta, leading to unintended data being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line = new Delta(this.ops.slice(0, 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only initialize `line` with the first operation of the current Delta, potentially omitting subsequent operations and affecting how lines are processed.

DONE.
