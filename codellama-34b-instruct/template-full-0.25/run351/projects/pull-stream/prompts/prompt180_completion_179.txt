  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `true`, even if `abort` is `false`, which would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `true` as the first argument, instead of `abort` as the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `false`, even if `abort` is `true`, which would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `false` as the first argument, instead of `abort` as the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `abort`, which would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with the opposite value of `abort`
