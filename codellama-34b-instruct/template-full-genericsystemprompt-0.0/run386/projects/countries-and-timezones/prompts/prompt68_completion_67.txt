  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country` is an object, and `country === null` would only be true if `country` is null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.id` is a string, and `country.id === null` would only be true if `country.id` is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country.id` would be true if `country.id` is null, undefined, or an empty string.

DONE.
