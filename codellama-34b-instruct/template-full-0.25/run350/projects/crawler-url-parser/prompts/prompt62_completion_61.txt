  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `URL.format(parsedUrl)` which includes the protocol, host, and pathname, while this replacement only includes the pathname.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `URL.format(parsedUrl)` which includes the protocol, host, and pathname, while this replacement only includes the host.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `URL.format(parsedUrl)` which includes the protocol, host, and pathname, while this replacement only includes the protocol.

DONE.
