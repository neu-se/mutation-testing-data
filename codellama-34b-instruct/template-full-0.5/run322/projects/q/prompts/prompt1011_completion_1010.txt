  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object instead of using the existing one, which could cause the promise chain to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().makeNodeResolver().resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise instead of waiting for the callback to be called, which could cause the promise chain to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().makeNodeResolver().reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise instead of waiting for the callback to be called, which could cause the promise chain to behave differently.

DONE.
