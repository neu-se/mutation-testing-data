  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, which is not the same as the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, so it would not have a `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, so it would not have a `dispatch` method.

DONE.
