  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` would be negative, which would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` to be called immediately, even if there are still pending promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` would be equal to the number of promises, which would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` to be called immediately, even if there are still pending promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 0 && promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` would be checked against the number of promises, which would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` to be called only if there are no pending promises and there are still promises to be resolved.

DONE.
