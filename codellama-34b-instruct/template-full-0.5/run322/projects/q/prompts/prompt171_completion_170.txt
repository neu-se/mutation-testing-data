  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, as the `isNodeFrame` function is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, as the `isNodeFrame` function is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, as the `isInternalFrame` function is not defined in the provided code snippet.

DONE.
