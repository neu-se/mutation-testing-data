  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and calling it would execute the function, while the original code fragment `onAbort` simply refers to the function without calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.call(null)` would call the `onAbort` function with a `this` value of `null`, while the original code fragment `onAbort` would call the function with the original `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.bind(null)` would create a new function that, when called, would call the original `onAbort` function with a `this` value of `null`, while the original code fragment `onAbort` would call the function with the
