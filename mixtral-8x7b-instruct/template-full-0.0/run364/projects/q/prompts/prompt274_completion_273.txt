 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always be true, and the error would be wrapped in a resolved promise, which might not be handled correctly by the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
