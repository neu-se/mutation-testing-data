  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 0.00001
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `φ2` to calculate the latitude of the destination point, but adding a small value to `φ2` would result in a different latitude value, which would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 - 0.00001
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `φ2` to calculate the latitude of the destination point, but subtracting a small value from `φ2` would result in a different latitude value, which would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 * 0.99999
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `φ2` to calculate
