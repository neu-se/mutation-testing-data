  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `Op` object is a number, and subtracting 1 from it would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `Op` object is a number, and adding 1 to it would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `Op` object is a number, and multiplying it by 2 would result in a different value.

DONE.
