  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a['arg']) * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function takes a single argument, but `a['arg']` is not a number, so the function would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` are inverse functions and the result of `Math.cos` would be different from `Math.sin` with the same argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is a different function from `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` and would produce a different result.

DONE.
