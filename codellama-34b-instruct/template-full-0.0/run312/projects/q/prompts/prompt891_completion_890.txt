  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` method expects an array of arguments, but `null` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` method expects an array of arguments, but `[]` is an empty array, which may not contain the expected arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` method expects an array of arguments, but `[1, 2, 3]` is an array of numbers, which may not be the expected arguments.

DONE.
