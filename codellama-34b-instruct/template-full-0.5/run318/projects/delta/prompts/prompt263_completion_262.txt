  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed to the `AttributeMap.diff` method, which would cause it to return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed to the `AttributeMap.diff` method, which would cause it to return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty object `{}` would be passed to the `AttributeMap.diff` method, which would cause it to return a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
