Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the path being parsed from the destination's parent directory to the destination itself, potentially altering the comparison with the source parent or root path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the path being parsed from the destination's parent directory to the source directory, which could lead to incorrect comparisons and potentially allow or block operations based on the source's properties instead of the destination's.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the destination's parent directory to the root directory ('/'), potentially causing the function to return prematurely without checking all parent directories, and thus might not correctly identify if the destination is a subdirectory of the source.

DONE.
