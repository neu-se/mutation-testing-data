  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an attribute named "base" on the current element, while this new code fragment is looking for an attribute named "basea".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base'.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an attribute named "base" on the current element, while this new code fragment is looking for an attribute named "BASE".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base'.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an attribute named "base" on the current element, while this new code fragment is looking for an attribute named "ase".

DONE.
