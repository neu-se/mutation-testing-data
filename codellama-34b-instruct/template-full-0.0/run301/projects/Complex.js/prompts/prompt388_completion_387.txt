  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the `tanh` and `coth` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the `tanh` and `coth` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the `tanh` and `coth` functions.

DONE.
