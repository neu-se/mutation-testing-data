  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!handler.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the handler is zero, but the handler is an object and does not have a length property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.handlers[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if there is a handler for the given embed type, but the handler is an object with an undefined property for the given embed type.

DONE.
