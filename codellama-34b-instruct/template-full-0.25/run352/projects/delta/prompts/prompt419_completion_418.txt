  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'delete', while the new code fragment checks if it is not 'delete'. This would cause the code to behave differently when the next type is 'delete'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'delete', while the new code fragment checks if it is 'insert'. This would cause the code to behave differently when the next type is 'insert'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'delete', while the new code fragment checks if it is 'retain'. This would cause the code to behave differently when the next type is 'retain'.

DONE.
