  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would match words that end with "o" but do not start with "aeiouy".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would match words that end with "o" and start with "aeiouy".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would match words that end with "o" and start with "aeiouy".

DONE.
