  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` is a method that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `thenResolve` is a method that resolves the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that takes two callbacks as arguments, one for the resolved value and one for the rejected reason. It does not have a `resolve` method, so it would not behave the same as `thenResolve`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function () { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves with the value returned by the callback function, whereas `thenResolve` resolves the promise with the given value.

DONE.
