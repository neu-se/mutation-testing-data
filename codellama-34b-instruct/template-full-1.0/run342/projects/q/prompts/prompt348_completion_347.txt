  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise immediately, instead of sending the value to the next then.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the value, instead of sending it to the next then.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the exception from the reject, instead of sending it to the next then.

DONE.
