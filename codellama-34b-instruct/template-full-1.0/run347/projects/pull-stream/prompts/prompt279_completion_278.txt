  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `!prop` will return `false` for any truthy value of `prop`, while the original code fragment `prop` simply returns the value of `prop`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop = 0` will assign the value `0` to `prop`, while the original code fragment `prop` simply returns the value of `prop`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop = 1` will assign the value `1` to `prop`, while the original code fragment `prop` simply returns the value of `prop`.

DONE.
