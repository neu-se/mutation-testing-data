Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) + 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional 90 degrees to the calculated latitude, which would incorrectly shift the resulting geographic point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the calculated latitude, which would lead to an incorrect representation of the geographic point, potentially placing it in an entirely different location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 180 degrees from the calculated latitude, which could result in an invalid latitude value and misrepresent the geographic point.

DONE.
