  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset + 1
```
This change will cause the `dstOffsetStr` to be one hour ahead of the `utcOffsetStr`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset - 1
```
This change will cause the `dstOffsetStr` to be one hour behind the `utcOffsetStr`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset * 2
```
This change will cause the `dstOffsetStr` to be twice the value of the `utcOffsetStr`, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
