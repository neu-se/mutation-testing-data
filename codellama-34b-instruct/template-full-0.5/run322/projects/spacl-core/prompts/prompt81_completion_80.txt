  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the path is null, and if it is, it returns true. Replacing it with null would cause the code to always return true, regardless of the value of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the path is undefined, and if it is, it returns true. Replacing it with undefined would cause the code to always return true, regardless of the value of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the path is an empty string, and if it is, it returns true. Replacing it with an empty string would cause the code to always return true, regardless of the value of the path.

DONE.
