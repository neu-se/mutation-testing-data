  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer.call(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Buffer.isBuffer.call(content)` will always return `true`, even if `content` is not a buffer. In contrast, `Buffer.isBuffer(content)` will return `true` only if `content` is a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.isBuffer` will always return `undefined`, even if `content` is a buffer. In contrast, `Buffer.isBuffer(content)` will return `true` only if `content` is a buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof content === 'Buffer'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof content === 'Buffer'` will always return `false`, even if `content` is a buffer. In contrast, `Buffer.isBuffer(content)` will return `true` only if `content` is a
