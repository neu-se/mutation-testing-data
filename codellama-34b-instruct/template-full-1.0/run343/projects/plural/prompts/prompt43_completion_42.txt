  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned by the `substr` method would be different. In the original code, the substring returned is the last two characters of the word, while in the mutant code, the substring returned is the last three characters of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.charAt(w.length - 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned by the `substr` method would be different. In the original code, the substring returned is the last two characters of the word, while in the mutant code, the substring returned is the third-to-last character of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned by the `substr` method would be different. In the original code, the substring returned is the last two characters of the word, while in the mutant code
