Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the case where the base is positive to be treated as if it were fully imaginary, potentially leading to incorrect results for positive bases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the case where the base is zero to be treated as if it were fully imaginary, which would lead to incorrect calculations for the power of zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the exponent is real instead of checking if the base is fully imaginary, which could lead to incorrect handling of complex exponentiation.

DONE.
