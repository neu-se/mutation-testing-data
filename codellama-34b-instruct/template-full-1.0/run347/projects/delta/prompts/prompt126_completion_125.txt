  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > start
```
This would result in different behavior because the if-statement would always evaluate to true, even if the index is less than the start.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index != start
```
This would result in different behavior because the if-statement would only be true if the index is not equal to the start, which would not execute the code inside the if-statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start > index
```
This would result in different behavior because the if-statement would only be true if the start is greater than the index, which would not execute the code inside the if-statement.

DONE.
