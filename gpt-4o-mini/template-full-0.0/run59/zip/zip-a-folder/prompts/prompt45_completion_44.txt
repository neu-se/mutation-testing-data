Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'nonexistent_directory/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifies a hardcoded path that does not exist, leading to an error when trying to zip a directory that cannot be found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + '_backup'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends '_backup' to the original source path, potentially causing the code to look for a directory that does not exist, thus resulting in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the source path to uppercase, which may not match the actual directory name on a case-sensitive file system, leading to a failure in locating the directory.

DONE.
