  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` variable is now converted to uppercase, which could affect the behavior of the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` variable is now converted to lowercase, which could affect the behavior of the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/[a-z]/g, 'x')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` variable is now modified to replace all lowercase letters with the letter "x", which could affect the behavior of the `query` method.

DONE.
