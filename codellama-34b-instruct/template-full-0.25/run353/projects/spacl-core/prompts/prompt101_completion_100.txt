  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `verb` string with the string `'foo'`, resulting in a different query string than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `verb` string to uppercase, which could potentially change the meaning of the query.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the `verb` string, resulting in a different query string than the original code.

DONE.
