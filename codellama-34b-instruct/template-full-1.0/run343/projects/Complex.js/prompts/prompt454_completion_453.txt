```
this['isFinite]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` only checks if the
number is finite (i.e., not NaN and not infinite), whereas `isNaN` also checks
if the number is `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` only checks if the
number is equal to zero, whereas `isNaN` also checks if the number is `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` only checks if the
number is infinite, whereas `isNaN` also checks if the number is `NaN`.

DONE.
