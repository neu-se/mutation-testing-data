 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty array for `rest()` method after the first call, instead of considering the remaining elements in the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
