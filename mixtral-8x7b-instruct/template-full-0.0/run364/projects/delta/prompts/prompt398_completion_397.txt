 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method of the `delta` object would receive a `null` value instead of an operation object, potentially causing issues in the subsequent code execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method of the `delta` object would receive an empty object instead of an operation object, potentially causing issues in the subsequent code execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method of the `delta` object would receive the next operation from the current delta instead of the next operation from the other delta, potentially causing issues in the subsequent code execution.

DONE.
