  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== null && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider `null` values as different from `undefined` values, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined || b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any value that is not `undefined` as different from `undefined`, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any value that is not equal to the corresponding value in the other object as different, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
