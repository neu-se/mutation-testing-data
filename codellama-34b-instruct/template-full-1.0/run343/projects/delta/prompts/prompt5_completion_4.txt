  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull && !!a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditional check for the `keepNull` variable and would also check if the value of `a[key]` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull || (a[key] === null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditional check for the `keepNull` variable and would also check if the value of `a[key]` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull || (a[key] === null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditional check for the `keepNull` variable and would also check if the value of `a[key]` is null.

DONE.
