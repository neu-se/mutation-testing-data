  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module == 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof module` would return 'string' instead of 'object', causing the `if` statement to evaluate to false and the code inside the block to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports == 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof exports` would return 'object' even if `module.exports` is not defined, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to true and the code inside the block to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof this == 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof this` would return 'object' even if `module` is not defined, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to true and the code inside the block to be executed.

DONE.
