  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of the `result.value` expression, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would change the value of the `result.value` expression, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of the `result.value` expression, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
