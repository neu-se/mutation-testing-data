  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not necessarily equal to the `b` variable, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b + 1` expression is not equivalent to the `b` expression, and would cause the `sin` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos(b)` expression is not equivalent to the `b` expression, and would cause the `sin` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
