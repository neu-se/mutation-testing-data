  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual(a[key], b[key])` checks for deep equality, while `a[key] !== b[key]` only checks for strict equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the key if the value is not equal and is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the key if the value is not equal and is not the same as the value in `b`.

DONE.
