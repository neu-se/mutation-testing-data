  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called immediately, rather than being passed as a reference to the `setTimeout` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with the `deferred.reject` function as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than being resolved after the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with the `deferred.resolve` function as an argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, rather than being rejected after the timeout.

DONE.
