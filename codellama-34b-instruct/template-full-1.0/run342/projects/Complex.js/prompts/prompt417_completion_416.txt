  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!!` operator coerces the expression to a boolean, inverting its meaning. If `this['isZero']()` returns `false`, the new expression would return `true`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, while the original code fragment checks if the real and imaginary parts are both zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real and imaginary parts are equal, while the original code fragment checks if both parts are zero.

DONE.
