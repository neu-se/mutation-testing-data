  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name === name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the provided predicate function, whereas the `map` method returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on each element. In this case, the `filter` method would return an empty array if the `name` property of the `policy` object does not match the `name` parameter passed to the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.find(policy => policy.name === name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `find` method returns the first element that satisfies the provided predicate function, whereas the `map` method returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on each element. In this case, the `find` method would return the first `policy` object that has a `name` property matching the `name` parameter passed to the `query` method, or `undefined
