  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the `args` array to the `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch` method, it would pass a new Error object, which would likely cause the code to behave differently and potentially throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello, World!"
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the `args` array to the `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch` method, it would pass the string "Hello, World!", which would likely cause the code to behave differently and potentially throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the `args` array to the `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch` method, it would pass `undefined`, which would likely cause the code to behave differently and potentially throw an error.

DONE.
