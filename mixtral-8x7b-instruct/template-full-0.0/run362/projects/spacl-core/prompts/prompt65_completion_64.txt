 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would no longer add any rules to the policy, but instead always add an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.rules.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array, so the `push` method would not modify the original `rules` array, but instead add a new array to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a shallow copy of the `rules` array, so the `push` method would modify the copy instead of the original `rules` array.

DONE.
