 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function would always return a resolved promise with a value of `null`, instead of handling the rejections and forwarding unhandled errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Rejected by mutation testing'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function would immediately reject the promise with an error, instead of waiting for the original promise to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function would always return a resolved promise without forwarding the original promise's value or error.

DONE.
