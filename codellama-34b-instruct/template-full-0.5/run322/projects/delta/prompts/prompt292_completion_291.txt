  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would allow the loop to continue, but the modified code fragment would exit the loop if the index is less than zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would allow the loop to continue, but the modified code fragment would exit the loop if the index is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would allow the loop to continue, but the modified code fragment would exit the loop if the index is even.

DONE.
