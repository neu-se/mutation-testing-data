  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a null value onto the laterQueue array, which would likely cause the program to throw an error when trying to access the null value as an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last item from the laterQueue array, which would likely cause the program to behave differently if the laterQueue array is used to store important information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.unshift(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an undefined value to the beginning of the laterQueue array, which would likely cause the program to behave differently if the laterQueue array is used to store important information.

DONE.
