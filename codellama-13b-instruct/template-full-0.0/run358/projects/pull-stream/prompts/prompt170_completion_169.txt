  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `array[i++]` expression, while the modified code fragment returns the result of the `cb` function call with the value of `array[i++]` as an argument. This could potentially cause issues if the `cb` function has side effects or if the `array[i++]` expression has side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the value of `i` before returning the value of `array[i]`, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `array[i]` without incrementing `i`. This could potentially cause issues if the `array` is expected to be iterated over multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i - 1])
```
This would result
