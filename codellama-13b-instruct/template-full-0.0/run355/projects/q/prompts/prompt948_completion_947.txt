  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nfbind` function is used to wrap the `FS.readFile` function, which is a Node.js function that accepts a callback as its last argument. The `Q.nfbind` function returns a new function that takes the same arguments as the original function, but returns a promise instead of accepting a callback. In this case, the `Q.nfbind` function is used to wrap the `FS.readFile` function, which means that the `Q.nfbind` function is used to create a new function that reads a file and returns a promise instead of accepting a callback.
