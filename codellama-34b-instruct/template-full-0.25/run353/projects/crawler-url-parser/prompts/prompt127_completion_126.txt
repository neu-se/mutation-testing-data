  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.path` is a string representing the path of the URL, while `linkurl` is an object containing information about the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.protocol` is a string representing the protocol of the URL, while `linkurl` is an object containing information about the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.host` is a string representing the host of the URL, while `linkurl` is an object containing information about the URL.

DONE.
