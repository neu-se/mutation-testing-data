  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
= <>;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the compartion from `==` to `===`, which would cause the conditional statement to always evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
== !<PLACEHOLDER>;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition, causing the code to branch to the else statement even if the condition is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!= <PLACEHOLDER>;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to branch to the else statement if the condition is true, which would cause the program to print "Not equal" even if the values are equal.

DONE.
