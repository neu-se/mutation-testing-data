  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not a function, but a reference to a function definition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not return any value, while this code fragment returns the value 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not contain any error handling, while this code fragment throws an error.

DONE.
