  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `data`, which would change the result of the `JSON.parse()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method would convert the value of `data` to a string, which would change the result of the `JSON.parse()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the value of `data`, which would change the result of the `JSON.parse()` method.

DONE.
