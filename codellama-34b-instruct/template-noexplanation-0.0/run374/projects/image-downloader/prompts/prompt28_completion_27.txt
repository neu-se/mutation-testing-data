  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This change will cause the code to check if the URL starts with the trimmed right side of the URL, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1).startsWith
```
This change will cause the code to check if the URL starts with the second character of the URL, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.indexOf('https') === 0
```
This change will cause the code to check if the URL starts with the string "https", which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
