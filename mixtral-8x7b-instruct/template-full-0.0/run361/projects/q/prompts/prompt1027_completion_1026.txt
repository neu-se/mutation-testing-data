 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (value) {
    Q.nextTick(function () {
        nodeback(value, null);
    });
}, function (error) {
    Q.nextTick(function () {
        nodeback(null, error);
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the nodeback callback is reversed, which is not consistent with Node.js conventions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(nodeback, nodeback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the nodeback function would be called twice in case of an error, which is not the expected behavior in Node.js.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(nodeback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the nodeback function would be called immediately, instead of being called with the resolved value or error of the promise.
