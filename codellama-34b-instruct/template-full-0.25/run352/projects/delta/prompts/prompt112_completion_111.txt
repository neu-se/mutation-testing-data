  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert = 'hello';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `op`, which would return the `op` object itself, whereas the modified code fragment would return a new object with an `insert` property set to the string `'hello'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes = { bold: true };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `op`, which would return the `op` object itself, whereas the modified code fragment would return a new object with an `attributes` property set to an object with a `bold` property set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain = 5;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `op`, which would return the `op` object itself, whereas the modified code fragment would return a new object with a `retain` property set to the number `5`.
