Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the length used for the operation by 1, potentially causing an off-by-one error in the composition logic, leading to incorrect results when merging operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to always take the maximum length between the two iterators, which could lead to unexpected results when composing operations, as it may consume more characters than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decreases the length used for the operation by 1, which could lead to missing out on processing the last character of an operation, resulting in incomplete or incorrect composition of the deltas.

DONE.
