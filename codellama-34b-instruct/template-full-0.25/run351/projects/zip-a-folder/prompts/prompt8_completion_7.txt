  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to proceed even if the source and target folders are the same, which could lead to unintended consequences such as overwriting the source folder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.includes(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to proceed even if the source folder is a subfolder of the target folder, which could lead to unintended consequences such as overwriting the source folder.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!targetBasePath.startsWith(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to proceed even if the target folder is a subfolder of the source folder, which could lead to unintended consequences such as overwriting the source folder.

DONE.
