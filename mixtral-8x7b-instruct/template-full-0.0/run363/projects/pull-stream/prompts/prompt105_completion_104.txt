 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of `drain` function by passing a number instead of null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of `drain` function by passing a boolean instead of null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of `drain` function by passing a function instead of null.

DONE.
