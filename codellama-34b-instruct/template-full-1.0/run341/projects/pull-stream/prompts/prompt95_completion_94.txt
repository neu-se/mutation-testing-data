  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `test` function may not expect to receive a falsy value as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a number, and `data + 1` is a different number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a function that expects to receive a string as an argument, and `test('foo')` is a different string.

DONE.
