  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks the type of the operand, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality, including the type. In this case, the `op.retain` property may be an object, but it may not be of type `'object'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, including the type. In this case, the `op.retain` property may be an object, but it may not be `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, including the type. In this case, the `op.retain` property may be an object, but it may not be `undefined`.

DONE.
