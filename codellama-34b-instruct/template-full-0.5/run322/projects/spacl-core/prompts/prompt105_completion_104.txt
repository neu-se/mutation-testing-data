  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the name, which would cause the `get()` method to return a different policy object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the name to uppercase, which would cause the `get()` method to return a different policy object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split("")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the first character of the name and use it as the key for the `get()` method, which would cause the method to return a different policy object.

DONE.
