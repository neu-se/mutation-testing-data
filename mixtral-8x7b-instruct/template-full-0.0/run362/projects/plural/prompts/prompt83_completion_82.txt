 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for adding "es" to words ending in "o" would be triggered, changing "mouse" to "mouses".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for adding "es" to words ending in "o" would not be triggered, and the rule for adding "s" to words would be triggered, changing "mouse" to "mouses".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mouce'
