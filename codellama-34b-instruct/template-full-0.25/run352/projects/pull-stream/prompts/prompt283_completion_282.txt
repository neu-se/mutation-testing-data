  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the replacement code fragment `cb(end, data)` is a function call with arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with one argument, while the replacement code fragment `cb(data)` is a function call with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with two arguments, while the replacement code fragment `cb(end, data, null)` is a function call with three arguments.

DONE.
