  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `length` would be decremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or to skip over certain elements in the `other` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `length` would be incremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop, potentially causing the loop to run for more iterations than necessary or to access out-of-bounds elements in the `other` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `length` would be doubled in each iteration of the while loop, potentially causing the loop to run for twice as many iterations as necessary or to access elements in the `other` array that are not adjacent to each other.

DONE.
