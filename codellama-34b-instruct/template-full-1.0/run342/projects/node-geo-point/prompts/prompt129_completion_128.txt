  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.floor((this.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor` function will always round down to the nearest integer, while the original code used `Math.floor` to calculate the `y` coordinate of the tile, which can lead to different tile coordinates and therefore different tile positions on the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.ceil((this.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.ceil` function will always round up to the nearest integer, while the original code used `Math.floor` to calculate the `x` coordinate of the tile, which can lead to different tile coordinates and therefore different tile positions on the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.round((this.
