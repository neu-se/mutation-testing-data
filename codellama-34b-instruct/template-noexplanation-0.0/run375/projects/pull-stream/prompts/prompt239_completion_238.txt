  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This code fragment is a simple replacement of the original code fragment, which is `cb`. It is a valid mutation that can be used to test the robustness of the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This code fragment is a more complex mutation that changes the behavior of the code by adding 1 to the `data` variable before passing it to the `cb` function. This mutation can be used to test the robustness of the test suite in the presence of unexpected input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data * 2)
```
This code fragment is another complex mutation that changes the behavior of the code by multiplying the `data` variable by 2 before passing it to the `cb` function. This mutation can be used to test the robustness of the test suite in the presence of unexpected input values.
