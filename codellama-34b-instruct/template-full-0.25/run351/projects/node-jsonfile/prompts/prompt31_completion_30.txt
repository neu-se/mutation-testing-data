  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is a different value than `options`, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is a different value than `options`, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `JSON.parse` method, which could cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
