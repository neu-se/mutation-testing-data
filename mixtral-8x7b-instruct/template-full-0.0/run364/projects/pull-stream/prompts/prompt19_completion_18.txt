 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the second argument instead of the first, potentially causing unexpected results or errors if the arguments array has fewer than 2 elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes and returns the last element of the arguments array, potentially causing unexpected results or errors if the array has fewer than 2 elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the length of the arguments array to 0, effectively clearing its contents, which could cause unexpected results or errors in the subsequent code that relies on the arguments array.

DONE.
