  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch".toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `dispatch` method directly, whereas this replacement would call the `toLowerCase()` method on the string `"dispatch"`, which would return the string `"dispatch"` unchanged. This would likely cause the `rejected` function to be called instead of the `resolve` function in the `Q.master` function, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `dispatch` method directly, whereas this replacement would add the number `1` to the string `"dispatch"`, which would result in the string `"dispatch1"`. This would likely cause the `Q.master` function to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled promise, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatched"
```
This would result in different behavior because the
