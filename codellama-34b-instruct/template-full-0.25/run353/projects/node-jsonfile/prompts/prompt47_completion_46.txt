  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.writeFileSync` method expects a file path as its first argument, but `null` is not a valid file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.writeFileSync` method expects a file path as its first argument, but `undefined` is not a valid file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.writeFileSync` method expects a file path as its first argument, but an empty string is not a valid file path.

DONE.
