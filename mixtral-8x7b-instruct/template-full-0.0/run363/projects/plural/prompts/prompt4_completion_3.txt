 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
10, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return an empty string instead of the string "Object".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-8, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return the string "[object " instead of the string "Object".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'[object Array]'
