  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method on `self` with the `error` argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the `error` reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method on `self` with a new `Error` object, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resolve` method on `self` with the `error` argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the `error` value instead of being rejected.

DONE.
