  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call with two arguments, while the new code fragment is a function call with only one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria', 'bacteriums')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call with two arguments, while the new code fragment is a function call with three arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call with two arguments, while the new code fragment is a function call with three arguments, and the third argument is a function that appends an 's' to the input word.

DONE.
