  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` function would be called instead of the `onFulfilled` function when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` function would be called instead of the `onFulfilled` function when the promise is in a pending state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function would be called instead of the `onFulfilled` function when the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
