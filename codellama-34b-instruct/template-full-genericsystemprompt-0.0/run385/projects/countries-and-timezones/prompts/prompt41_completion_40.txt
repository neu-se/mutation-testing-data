  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would increment the `prev` value by 1, which would cause the `reduce()` method to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the `prev` value by 2, which would cause the `reduce()` method to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would decrement the `prev` value by 1, which would cause the `reduce()` method to produce a different output.

DONE.
