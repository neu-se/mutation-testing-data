  
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comma-separated list of function calls, while the replacement code fragment is a single function call with multiple arguments. The replacement code fragment is more likely to cause a syntax error or unexpected behavior.
