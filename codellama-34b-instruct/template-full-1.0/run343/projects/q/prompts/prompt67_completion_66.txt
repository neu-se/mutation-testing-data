  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){console.log("Mutated!")}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would print a message to the console when the function is executed, which would not happen with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){throw new Error("Mutated!")}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when the function is executed, which would cause the code to stop executing and jump to the nearest error handler, if there is one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){return "Mutated!";}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string value when the function is executed, which would be interpreted differently by the surrounding code.

DONE.
