  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a length, not a literal 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a length, not a negative value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1 * baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a length, not a negative value multiplied by the base index.

DONE.
