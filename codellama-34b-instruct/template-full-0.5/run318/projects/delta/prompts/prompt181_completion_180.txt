  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is not being called with the correct number of arguments, which could cause the iterator to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is being called with a different number of arguments than it was originally called with, which could cause the iterator to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is being called with a different number of arguments than it was originally called with, which could cause the iterator to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
