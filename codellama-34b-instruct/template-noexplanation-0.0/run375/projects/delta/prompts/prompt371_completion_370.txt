  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) + 1
```
This change will cause the code to return a different value than the original code, which will reveal a bug in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) - 1
```
This change will also cause the code to return a different value than the original code, which will reveal a bug in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) * 2
```
This change will cause the code to return a different value than the original code, which will reveal a bug in the test suite.

DONE.
