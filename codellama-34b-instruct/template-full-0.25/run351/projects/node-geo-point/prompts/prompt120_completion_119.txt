  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, bearing, distance
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could cause the method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance + 1, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance argument has been increased by 1, which could cause the method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing argument has been increased by 1, which could cause the method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
