  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i--` operator decrements the value of `i` after it is used, resulting in the function returning the same value twice in a row if the `abort` parameter is not set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i+1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i+1` operator increments the value of `i` before it is used, resulting in the function returning the next value in the array instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i*2])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i*2` operator multiplies the value of `i` by 2 before it is used, resulting in the function returning every other value in the array instead of the current one.

DONE.
