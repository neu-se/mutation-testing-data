  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(φ2)` is not the same as `asin(φ2)`, as the former is the sine of φ2, while the latter is the arcsine of φ2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ2)` is not the same as `asin(φ2)`, as the former is the cosine of φ2, while the latter is the arcsine of φ2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan(φ2)` is not the same as `asin(φ2)`, as the former is the tangent of φ2, while the latter is the arcsine of φ2.

DONE.
