  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is now being passed as an array instead of a single value, which could cause the `dispatch` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is now being passed as an array with a different value as the second element, which could cause the `dispatch` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is now being passed as an array with the first element removed, which could cause the `dispatch` function to behave differently.

DONE.
