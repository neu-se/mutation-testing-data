  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` variable is a string, and `arg.length` returns the length of the string, whereas `arg` returns the string itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg.slice(0, 1)` returns the first character of the string, whereas `arg` returns the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg.toUpperCase()` returns the uppercase version of the string, whereas `arg` returns the original string.

DONE.
