  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array. In this case, the `stacks` array is used to store stack traces, and the `unshift` method is used to add a new stack trace to the beginning of the array. If `push` were used instead, the new stack trace would be added to the end of the array, which would result in a different order of stack traces.
