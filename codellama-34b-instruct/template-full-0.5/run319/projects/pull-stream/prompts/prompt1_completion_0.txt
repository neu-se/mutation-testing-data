  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(var k in sources)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through the `sources` object instead of the `throughs` object, which could cause the `exports` object to be populated with different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(var k in sinks)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through the `sinks` object instead of the `throughs` object, which could cause the `exports` object to be populated with different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(var k in throughs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through the `throughs` object instead of the `sources` object, which could cause the `exports` object to be populated with different values.

DONE.
