  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof exports` would evaluate to "function" instead of "object", which would cause the conditional statement to evaluate to `false` and the `module.exports` assignment would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof module` would evaluate to "number" instead of "object", which would cause the conditional statement to evaluate to `false` and the `module.exports` assignment would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof exports` would evaluate to "undefined" instead of "object", which would cause the conditional statement to evaluate to `false` and the `module.exports` assignment would not be executed.

DONE.
