  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.cos(b)` computes the cosine of the value `b` while the replaced code fragment `Math.sin(b)` computes the sine of the value `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(a)` computes the hyperbolic cosine of the value `a` while the replaced code fragment `Infinity` evaluates to infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(a)` computes the hyperbolic cosine of the value `a` while the replaced code fragment `0` evaluates to zero.

DONE.
