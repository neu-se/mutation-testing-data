Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `JSON.parse` to not use any reviver function, potentially leading to different object structures being returned compared to when the original reviver is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is treated differently than `null` in JavaScript, and passing `undefined` to `JSON.parse` would also mean that no reviver function is applied, but it may lead to confusion in the context of the options object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty function as the reviver, which would effectively ignore any transformations that might have been intended by the original reviver function, leading to potentially unexpected results in the parsed object.

DONE.
