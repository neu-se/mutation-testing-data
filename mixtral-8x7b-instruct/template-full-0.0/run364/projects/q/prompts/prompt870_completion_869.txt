 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to call the `nfapply` method on the `callback` function directly, which is not a function and does not have such a method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to call `nfapply` as a static method of the `Q` object, rather than an instance method of the promise returned by `Q(callback)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(callback).apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is not the same as `nfapply`. `apply` directly invokes the function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments, while `nfapply` wraps the function call in a promise.

DONE.
