  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always evaluate to `true`, even if `options` is not a string. This would result in the `if` statement always being executed, which would cause the code to behave differently than the original intent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always evaluate to `false`, even if `options` is a string. This would result in the `if` statement never being executed, which would cause the code to behave differently than the original intent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(options === 'string')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always evaluate to `true`, even if `options` is not a string. This would result in the `if` statement always being executed, which would cause the code to behave differently than the original intent.
