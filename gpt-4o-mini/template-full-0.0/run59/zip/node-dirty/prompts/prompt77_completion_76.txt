Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the emitted load event's second argument from `0` to `1`, which could mislead listeners into thinking that one item was loaded instead of none.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('File path is missing')
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits an error event instead of a load event, indicating a problem with the file path rather than signaling that loading has completed with zero items.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the size of the data plus one, which inaccurately suggests that there is one more item in the database than there actually is.

DONE.
