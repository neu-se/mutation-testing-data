  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not add the new operation to the `ops` array, causing the `insert` method to not work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not add the new operation to the `ops` array, causing the `insert` method to not work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not add the new operation to the `ops` array, causing the `insert` method to not work correctly.

DONE.
