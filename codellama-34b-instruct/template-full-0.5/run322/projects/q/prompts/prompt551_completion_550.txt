  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.error` is `undefined` when the promise is fulfilled, and `undefined` is not a promise, so it would not be handled by the `when` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value + 1` is not the same as `result.value`, so it would not be the correct value to pass to the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, so it would not be handled by the `when` function.

DONE.
