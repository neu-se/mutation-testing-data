 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred` object would be used where a timeout ID is expected, which could cause unintended consequences such as resolving or rejecting the promise prematurely or inappropriately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` expects a number (the timeout ID) as its argument, and passing `null` would result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` expects a number (the timeout ID) as its argument, and passing a function (`setTimeout`) would result in an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
