  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is called with a different length parameter, which would result in a different substring being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(1, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is called with a different starting position, which would result in a different substring being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is called with a different length parameter, which would result in a different substring being returned. Additionally, the 'ies' suffix is replaced with a simple 's' suffix.

DONE.
