  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` whenever `this` or `z` is infinite, regardless of whether the other is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` only when both `this` and `z` are infinite, and not when one is infinite and the other is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || (z['isInfinite']() && this['isZero']())) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when `this` is infinite and
