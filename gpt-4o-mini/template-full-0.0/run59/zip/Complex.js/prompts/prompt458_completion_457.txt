Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` when the complex number is finite, which is the opposite of the intended check for infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity || this['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if either the real or imaginary part is exactly `Infinity`, rather than checking if the complex number as a whole is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']() && this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the complex number is NaN and finite at the same time, which is logically impossible and does not correctly identify an infinite complex number.

DONE.
