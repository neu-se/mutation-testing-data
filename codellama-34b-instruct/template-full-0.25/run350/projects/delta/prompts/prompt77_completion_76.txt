  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if it is not an object. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `lastOp` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if `lastOp.insert` is not null. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `lastOp.insert` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if `lastOp.delete` is greater than 0. This would cause the code to behave differently in
