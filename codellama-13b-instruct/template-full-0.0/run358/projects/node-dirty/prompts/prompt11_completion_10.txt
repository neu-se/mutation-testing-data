  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the list of callbacks associated with the given key from the queue, rather than retrieving the list of callbacks associated with the key from the queue and then retrieving the value associated with the key from the data map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the length of the list of callbacks associated with the given key from the queue, rather than retrieving the list of callbacks associated with the key from the queue and then retrieving the value associated with the key from the data map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key).pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the last callback in the list of callbacks associated with the given key from the queue, rather than retrieving the list of callbacks associated with the key from
