  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the `onAbort` function with the `this` context set to the `once` function's context, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the `onAbort` function with the `this` context set to the `once` function's context, and the `cb` function as an argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this, abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the `onAbort` function with the `this` context set to the `once` function's context, and the `abort` and `cb` functions as arguments, which may not be the intended behavior.
