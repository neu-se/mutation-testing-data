  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getTimezone(id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry()` and `getTimezone()` are not equivalent functions. While `getCountry()` returns a country object, `getTimezone()` returns a time zone object. Using `getTimezone()` in place of `getCountry()` would cause the code to return a time zone object instead of a country object, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: deliverCountry(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because `deliverCountry()` and `getCountry()` are not equivalent functions. While `getCountry()` returns a country object without any modifications, `deliverCountry()` returns a country object with additional properties added to it. Using `deliverCountry()` in place of `getCountry()` would cause the code to return a country object with additional properties, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
