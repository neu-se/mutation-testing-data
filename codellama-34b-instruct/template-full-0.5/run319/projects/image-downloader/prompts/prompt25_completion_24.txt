  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname()` returns the directory name of the file, while `path.resolve()` returns the absolute path of the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(options.dest, '..')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join()` joins the path segments using the platform-specific separator, while `path.resolve()` returns the absolute path of the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename()` returns the file name without the directory path, while `path.resolve()` returns the absolute path of the file.

DONE.
