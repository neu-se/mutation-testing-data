  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.readFileSync()` method expects an options object, but passing `null` would cause a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to the `fs.readFileSync()` method would fallback to the default value, which is `null`, and the function would return the parsed file contents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.readFileSync()` method expects an options object, but passing a number would cause a TypeError.

DONE.
