  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the property with the given key, while this new code fragment sets the property to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the property with the given key, while this new code fragment retrieves the property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hasOwnProperty", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the property with the given key, while this new code fragment checks whether the object has the property.

DONE.
