  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while `1 + 1` is an arithmetic expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while `"string"` is a string literal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while `[]` is an empty array.

DONE.
