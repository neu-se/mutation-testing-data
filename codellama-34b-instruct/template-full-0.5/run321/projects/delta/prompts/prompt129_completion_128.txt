  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to loop infinitely, as iter.next() would always return the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to loop infinitely, as iter.next(index) would always return the same value for the same index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to loop infinitely, as iter.next(index + 1) would always return a different value for the same index.

DONE.
