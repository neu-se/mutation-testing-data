  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not a true array and does not have a `slice` method, so `array_slice(arguments)` would throw an error. By using `array_slice(arguments, 1)` instead, we are slicing the `arguments` object starting from the second element, which is the first argument passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)` would return an array containing only the first element of `arguments`, which is the function itself. This would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on the function object instead of the `promise` object, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
