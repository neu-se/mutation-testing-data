  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` operator is used to return undefined, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` keyword is used to return undefined, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` operator is used to return undefined, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to not be called, and the `null` value would be passed as the second argument to the `then` method, which would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
