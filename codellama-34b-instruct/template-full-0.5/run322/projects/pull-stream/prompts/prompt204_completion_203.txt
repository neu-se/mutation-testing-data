  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `null` is a null value. This change would cause the function to return `null` instead of calling the `cb` function, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `undefined` is an undefined value. This change would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of calling the `cb` function, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `throw new Error('error')` is a statement that throws an error. This change would cause the function to throw an error instead of calling the `cb` function, which could cause the program to
