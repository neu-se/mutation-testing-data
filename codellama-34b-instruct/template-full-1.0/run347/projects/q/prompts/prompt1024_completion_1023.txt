  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` is a function, and `bind` is a method that creates a new function with the same body as the original, but with a modified `this` value and/or bound arguments. By calling `bind` on `nodeback` and passing `null` as the `this` value, the `nodeback` function will be called with `null` as its `this` value, which may result in an error if the function relies on `this` being a specific object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => nodeback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `() =>` syntax defines a new function that takes no arguments and calls `nodeback` with no arguments. This new function will be called with the value of `nodeback` as its `this` value, which may result in an error if the function relies on `this` being a specific object.

Option 3: The PLACEH
