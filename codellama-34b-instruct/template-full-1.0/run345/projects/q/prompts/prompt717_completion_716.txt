  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is not a valid method for the `Promise.prototype` object. The original code uses "keys" to get the keys of the eventually settled object, whereas "values" would return the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because "length" is not a valid method for the `Promise.prototype` object. The original code uses "keys" to get the keys of the eventually settled object, whereas "length" would return the number of items in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"toString"
```
This would result in different behavior because "toString" is not a valid method for the `Promise.prototype` object. The original code uses "keys" to get the keys of the eventually settled object, whereas "toString" would return a string representation of the object.

DONE.
