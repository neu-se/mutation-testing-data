  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `end && false` is always false, so the `once` function would never be called, even if `end` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end || true` is always true, so the `once` function would always be called, even if `end` is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ^ true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end ^ true` is the same as `end !== true`, so the `once` function would only be called if `end` is not true, even if `end` is false.

DONE.
