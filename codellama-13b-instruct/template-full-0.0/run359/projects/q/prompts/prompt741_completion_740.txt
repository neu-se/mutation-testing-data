  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new promise that is never resolved or rejected, which would cause the `all` function to wait indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new promise that is immediately resolved, which would cause the `all` function to return immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new promise that is immediately rejected, which would cause the `all` function to return immediately with an error.

DONE.
