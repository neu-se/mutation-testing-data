  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function(value) {
    return value;
}, function(reason) {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a resolved promise with the original value, rather than a rejected promise with the original reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function(value) {
    return value + 1;
}, function(reason) {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a resolved promise with the original value plus 1, rather than a rejected promise with the original reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function(value) {
    return value;
}, function(reason) {
    return reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a resolved promise with the original reason, rather than a rejected promise with the original reason.

DONE.
