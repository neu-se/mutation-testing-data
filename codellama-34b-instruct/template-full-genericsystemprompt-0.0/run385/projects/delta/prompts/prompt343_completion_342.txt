  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).invert(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is not defined for the `embedType` object, and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).transform(opData, baseOpData, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is not defined for the `embedType` object, and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).retain(opData, baseOpData, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method is not defined for the `embedType` object, and would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
