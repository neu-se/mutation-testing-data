  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a rejection object containing only the `message` property, instead of the entire `rejection` object, which could contain other useful information such as the error `name` and `stack`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify({ index: index + 1, value: rejection });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify with the next index in the `promises` array, instead of the current index, which could cause the notification to start at the wrong index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the `promises` array, instead of the resulting values, which could contain other information such as the resolved values and intermediate rejections.

DONE.
