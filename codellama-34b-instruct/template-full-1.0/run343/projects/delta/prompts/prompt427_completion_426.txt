  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null && typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the case where `op.retain` is not null but not a number, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the case where `op.retain` is not a number, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the case where `op.retain` is a string, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
