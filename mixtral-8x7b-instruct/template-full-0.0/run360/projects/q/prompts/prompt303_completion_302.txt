 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let i = answerPs.length, len = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will not execute since `i` is initialized to the length of the array, and `len` is initialized to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let i = -1, len = answerPs.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will not execute in the first iteration since `i` is initialized to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let i, len = answerPs.length; for (i in answerPs) { Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop uses a `for...in` statement instead of a `for` loop, which can iterate over properties in addition to array indices. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the array-like object has additional properties.
