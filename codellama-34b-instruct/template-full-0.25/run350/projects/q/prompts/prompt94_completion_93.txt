  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator checks if the property exists in the object, while the `>` operator checks if the value is greater than the length of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator checks if the property exists in the object, while the `<` operator checks if the value is less than the length of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator checks if the property exists in the object, while the `!==` operator checks if the value is not equal to the length of the object.

DONE.
