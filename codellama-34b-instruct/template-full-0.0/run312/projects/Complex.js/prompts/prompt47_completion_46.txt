  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` property is being checked on the wrong object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in b && 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` property is being checked on the wrong object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` property is being checked on the wrong object.

DONE.
