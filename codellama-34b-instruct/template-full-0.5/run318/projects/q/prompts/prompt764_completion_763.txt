  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because `when` is a function that returns a promise, but it is not being used as a method on the `promise` object, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method on the `promise` object, but it is not being used as a standalone function, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a method on the `promise` object that returns a promise for the state of the promise, but it is not being used as
