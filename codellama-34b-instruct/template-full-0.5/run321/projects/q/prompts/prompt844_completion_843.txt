  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method expects a function as its second argument, but `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method expects a function as its second argument, but `function() {}` is not the same function as `error`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(e) { throw e; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method expects a function as its second argument, but `function(e) { throw e; }` is not the same function as `error`.

DONE.
