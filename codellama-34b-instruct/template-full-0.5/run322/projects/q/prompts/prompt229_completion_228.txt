  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the arguments object instead of the array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to only return the first argument instead of the entire array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[args.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the last argument instead of the entire array of arguments.

DONE.
