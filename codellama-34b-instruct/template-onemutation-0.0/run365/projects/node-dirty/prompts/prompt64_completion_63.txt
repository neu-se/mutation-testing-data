  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` is a method that closes the stream immediately, whereas `end()` is a method that closes the stream after all data has been written to it. In this case, using `destroy()` would cause the stream to be closed before all data has been written, which could result in data loss or corruption.
