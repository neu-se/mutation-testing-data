  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` before calling `cb`, while the mutated code fragment decrements `i` before calling `cb`. This change would cause the function to return a different value for `i` than the original code fragment.

DONE.
