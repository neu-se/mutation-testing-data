  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` returns the base-10 logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log2` returns the base-2 logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log1p
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log1p` returns the natural logarithm of 1 plus the input number, whereas `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of the input number.

DONE.
