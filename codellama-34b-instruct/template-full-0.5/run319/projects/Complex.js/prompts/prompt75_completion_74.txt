  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 1 instead of 0, and the first iteration would be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from -1 instead of 0, and the first iteration would be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = a
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the value of `a` instead of 0, and the first iteration would be skipped.

DONE.
