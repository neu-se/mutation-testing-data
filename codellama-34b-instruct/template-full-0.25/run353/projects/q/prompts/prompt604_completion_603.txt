  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, and it would cause the `dispatch` method to return a promise that is already resolved, which would not allow the function to be called in a future turn.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(Q.reject(new Error("Invalid argument")));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to return a promise that is already rejected, which would not allow the function to be called in a future turn.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(Q.async(function () {
    throw new Error("Invalid argument");
}));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to return a promise that is already resolved with a function that throws an error, which would not allow the function to be called in a future turn.
