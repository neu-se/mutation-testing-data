  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `apply` is a function that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value and arguments, whereas `apply` calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, whereas `apply` calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments.

DONE.
