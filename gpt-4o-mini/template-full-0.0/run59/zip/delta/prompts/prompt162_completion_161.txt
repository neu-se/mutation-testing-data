Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially leading to incorrect operations being processed in the `delta` if the next operation is not consumed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the current iterator (`thisIter`) instead of the `otherIter`, which means it would incorrectly process operations from the current delta instead of the other delta, leading to unexpected results in the composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `otherIter` to consume exactly one operation regardless of the actual length of the operation, which could lead to incomplete or incorrect operations being added to the `delta`.

DONE.
