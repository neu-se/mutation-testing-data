  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof href == "undefined"` check is removed, which would allow the code to execute even if the `href` variable is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
