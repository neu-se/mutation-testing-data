  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are inverse hyperbolic functions, and swapping them would cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not inverse functions of each other. Swapping them would cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `asinh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not inverse functions of each other. Swapping them would cause the function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
