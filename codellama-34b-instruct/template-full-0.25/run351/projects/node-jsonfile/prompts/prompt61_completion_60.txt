  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.isBuffer` method returns `true` if the input is a buffer, and `false` otherwise. By replacing it with `Buffer.isBuffer(content) === false`, the code would only execute the `content.toString('utf8')` statement if `content` is not a buffer, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `content` is actually a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf8') === 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method returns a string representation of the buffer, and the `=== 'utf8'` comparison would always evaluate to `false`. This would cause the `content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')` statement to be skipped, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `content` actually starts with the UTF-8 BOM character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
