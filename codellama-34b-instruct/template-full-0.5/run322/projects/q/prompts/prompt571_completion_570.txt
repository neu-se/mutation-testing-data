  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods for calling functions in JavaScript. `call` allows you to specify the value of `this` inside the function, while `apply` allows you to specify an array of arguments. In this case, using `call` instead of `apply` would likely cause the function to behave differently, as it would be called with a different value of `this` and a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a specific value of `this` and specific arguments. In this case, using `bind` instead of `apply` would likely cause the function to behave differently, as it would be called with a different value of `this` and a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call
