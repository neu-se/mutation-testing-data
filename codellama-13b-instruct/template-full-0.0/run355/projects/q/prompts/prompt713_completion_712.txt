  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the keys of the object, while the new code fragment returns the value at index 1 of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", ["a"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the keys of the object, while the new code fragment returns the value at index "a" of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1, 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the keys of the object, while the new code fragment returns the values at indices 1 and 2 of the object.

DONE.
