Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/cello$/, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds an 's' to the word "cello" instead of the correct plural form "cellos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cellosies')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected plural form to "cellosies", which is not a valid pluralization for "cello".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/cello$/, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'oes' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly transforms "cello" into "celloes", which is not the correct plural form.

DONE.
