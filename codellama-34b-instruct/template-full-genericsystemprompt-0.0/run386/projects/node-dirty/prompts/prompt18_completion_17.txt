  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `cbs` array, whereas the original code fragment `cbs` refers to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.concat([])` creates a new array by concatenating `cbs` with an empty array, whereas the original code fragment `cbs` refers to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(() => true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.filter(() => true)` creates a new array by filtering the elements of `cbs` based on the provided predicate function, whereas the original code fragment `cbs` refers to the original array.

DONE.
