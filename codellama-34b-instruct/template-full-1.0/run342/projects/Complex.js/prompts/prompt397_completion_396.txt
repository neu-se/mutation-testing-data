  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asin'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add an extra 1 to the result of the `asin` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asin'](this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asin` function would be called with the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos'](this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function would be called with the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

DONE.
