  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bearing` value would be offset by 180 degrees, which would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bearing` value would be doubled, which would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bearing` value would be offset by -180 degrees, which would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different destination point.

DONE.
