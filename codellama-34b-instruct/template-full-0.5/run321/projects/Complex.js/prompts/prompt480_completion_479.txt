  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `isNaN`, causing the `isInfinite` method to return `true` when the original code would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` would check if the number is finite, while `isNaN` checks if the number is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the number is equal to zero, while `isNaN` checks if the number is not a number.

DONE.
