  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the reason, which would change the error message that is thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the reason to uppercase, which would change the error message that is thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.split(" ").reverse().join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the words in the reason, which would change the error message that is thrown.

DONE.
