 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would start iterating from the beginning of the operations array, regardless of the `start` parameter value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would start iterating from the end of the operations array, effectively skipping the first `start` elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would start iterating from the current `index`, regardless of the `start` parameter value.

DONE.
