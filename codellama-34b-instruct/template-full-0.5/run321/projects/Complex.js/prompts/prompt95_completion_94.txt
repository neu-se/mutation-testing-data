  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not defined in the current scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the `c` variable is not defined in the current scope.

DONE.
