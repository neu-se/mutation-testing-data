  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a[key] !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the value is `undefined` or `null`, while this code only checks if the value is `undefined`. This minor change could cause tests to pass even if the value of `a[key]` is `null`, which may not be desirable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` has the property `key`, while this code checks if `a` has the property `key` and if it is an enumerable property. This change could cause tests to fail if `a` is a prototype object and `key` is not an enumerable property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(a[key] != null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a[key]`
