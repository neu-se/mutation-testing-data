  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to always overwrite the existing value for a given key, rather than only if the key does not already exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl.url);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to always set the value for a given key to the key itself, rather than the `currentUrl` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl.text);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to always set the value for a given key to the `text` property of the `currentUrl` object, rather than the `currentUrl` object itself.

DONE.
