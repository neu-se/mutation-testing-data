  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the result is exactly equal to `true`, while this replacement checks if the result is not equal to `true`. This means that if the result is `false` or any other value that is not exactly equal to `true`, the replacement code fragment would return `true`, while the original code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the result is exactly equal to `true`, while this replacement checks if the result is exactly equal to `false`. This means that if the result is any other value that is not exactly equal to `false`, the replacement code fragment would return `false`, while the original code fragment would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
