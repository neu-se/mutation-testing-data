  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is not a valid method for a Q object, whereas "keys" is a valid method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because "length" is a property of an array, not a method, and it would return the length of the array, not the keys of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getOwnPropertyNames"
```
This would result in different behavior because "getOwnPropertyNames" is a method of an object, but it would not return the keys of the object, but rather the names of all properties, including non-enumerable ones.

DONE.
