  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!policy.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `matches` function, causing the `matches` method to always return `true` if the policy matches, and `false` if it does not, regardless of the actual result of the `matches` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to the current instance of the `Policy` class, which would cause the `matches` method to be called with the wrong `this` value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches && otherPolicy.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both policies match, rather than just the `policy` policy. If the `otherPolicy` policy does not match, the result of the expression would be `false`, even if the `policy` policy does
