  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `test` method, causing the function to return `null` if the regular expression matches the input string, and the original function would return `null` if the regular expression does not match the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.match
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would return an array of matches, while the `test` method would return a boolean indicating whether the regular expression matches the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.search
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` method would return the index of the first match, while the `test` method would return a boolean indicating whether the regular expression matches the input string.
