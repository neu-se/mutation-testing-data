  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args + args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `args` array with itself, resulting in a different value than the original `args.concat(array_slice(arguments))`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the `args` array, rather than concatenating it with another array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `args` array with an empty array, resulting in a different value than the original `args.concat(array_slice(arguments))`.

DONE.
