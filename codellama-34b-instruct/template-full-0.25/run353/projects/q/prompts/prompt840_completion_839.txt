  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to `then`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be bound to `null` rather than the `promise` object, which could cause it to behave differently when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { onUnhandledError(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be wrapped in a new function, which could cause it to behave differently when called.

DONE.
