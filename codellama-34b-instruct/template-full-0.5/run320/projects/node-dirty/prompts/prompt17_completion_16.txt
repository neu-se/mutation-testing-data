  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the key being accessed in the map, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the key being accessed in the map, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the key being accessed in the map, potentially causing the test to fail.

DONE.
