Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) < Complex['EPSILON'] * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison from checking if the difference is less than or equal to `Complex['EPSILON']` to checking if it is less than `Complex['EPSILON'] * 2`, which could allow for larger discrepancies to be considered equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) >= Complex['EPSILON'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the absolute difference is greater than or equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`, which would incorrectly indicate that two complex numbers are not equal when they actually are.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['im'] + this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds `this['im']` to `z['im']` instead of subtracting it, which would yield a different result and potentially lead to false negatives
