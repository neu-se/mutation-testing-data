  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.toLowerCase()
```
This change will cause the `set` method to always execute the code in the `else` block, even if the `key` is not in the `_queue` map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.length
```
This change will cause the `set` method to always execute the code in the `if` block, even if the `key` is not in the `_queue` map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.split('.').length
```
This change will cause the `set` method to always execute the code in the `if` block, even if the `key` is not in the `_queue` map.

DONE.
