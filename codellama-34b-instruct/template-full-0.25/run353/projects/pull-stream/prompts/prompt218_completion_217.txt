  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with `null` instead of `err`, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with `undefined` instead of `err`, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with `null` instead of `err`, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
