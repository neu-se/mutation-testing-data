  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Incorrectly checks whether a character is a newline
const isNewline = op => {
  return op.toString() === '\n';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of a newline character in a more robust way, by using the `startsWith('\n')` method. The replacement code uses `===` to check for equality, which can lead to false negatives if the string representation of the character is not exactly equal to the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Incorrectly checks whether an operation is a deletion
const isDeletion = op => {
  return op.length() > 0 && op.peek() === '';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether an operation is a deletion by looking at its `attributes` property. The replacement code uses a length check and a condition to check for the presence of an empty string, which can lead to false positives if there are operations with a
