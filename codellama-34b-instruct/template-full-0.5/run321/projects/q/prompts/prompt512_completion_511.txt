  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_values
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_values` returns an array of the values in the object, whereas `object_keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values in the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(value)` returns an array of the keys in the object, whereas `Object.values(value)` returns an array of the values in the object.

DONE.
