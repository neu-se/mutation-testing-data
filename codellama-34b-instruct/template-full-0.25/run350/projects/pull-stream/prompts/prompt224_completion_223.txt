  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `test` function, causing the filter to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the filter to return `false` if `test` is `true`, which would cause the filter to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the filter to return `true` if `test` is `false`, which would cause the filter to return the opposite of what it should.

DONE.
