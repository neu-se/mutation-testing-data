  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with the `data` argument, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, opts)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with the `data` and `opts` arguments, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
