  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is truthy, while the replacement code fragment checks if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is truthy, while the replacement code fragment checks if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"aborted"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is truthy, while the replacement code fragment checks if it is a string with the value "aborted".

DONE.
