  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with an argument of `2`, which would cause the iterator to skip over the next line and return the attributes of the line after that instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with an argument of `1`, which would cause the iterator to return the attributes of the next line instead of the current line. Additionally, the `i` variable is incremented by `1` instead of `0`, which would cause the `eachLine` method to start iterating over the lines of the delta starting from the second line instead of the first line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the
