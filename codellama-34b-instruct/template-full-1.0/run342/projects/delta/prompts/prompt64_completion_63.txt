  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    this.push(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this.push` was responsible for pushing the new op into the array of ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    this.push(lastOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always push the last op into the array of ops instead of the new op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    this.push(this.ops[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always push the first op into the array of ops, regardless of the new op.

DONE.
