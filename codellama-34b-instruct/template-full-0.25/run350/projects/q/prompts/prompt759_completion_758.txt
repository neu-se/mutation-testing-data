```
allResolved, "allResolved", "allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function name "allResolved" is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled, "allSettled", "allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function name "allSettled" is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allSettled", "allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function name "allResolved" is not defined in the code snippet.

DONE.
