  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `true` as the second argument to the `f` function, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
g(f)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `g` function with `f` as an argument, and the `g` function may have different behavior depending on the value of its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f.bind(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to the `null` context and has `true` as the second argument, which may cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
