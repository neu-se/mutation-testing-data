  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.delete()` would delete the entire line, whereas `line.push()` would only push the current operation onto the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(Op.length(thisOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.retain(Op.length(thisOp))` would retain the entire line, whereas `line.push()` would only push the current operation onto the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert(Op.length(thisOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.insert(Op.length(thisOp))` would insert a new operation onto the line, whereas `line.push()` would only push the current operation onto the line.

DONE.
