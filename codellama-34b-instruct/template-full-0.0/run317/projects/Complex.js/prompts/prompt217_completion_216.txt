  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * loh + z['re'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations is reversed, causing the result to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `1` is added to the result, causing the final output to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` term is multiplied by `2`, causing the final output to be incorrect.

DONE.
