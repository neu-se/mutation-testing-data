  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, start) - start;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not handle the case where the newline character is not found, and would return a negative index instead of the expected positive index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = thisOp.insert.lastIndexOf(newline, start) - start;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would find the last occurrence of the newline character instead of the first one, and would return a different index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, start) + start;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the newline character relative to the start of the string instead of the end of the string, which would affect the behavior of the subsequent code.

DONE.
