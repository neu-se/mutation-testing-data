  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `resolvedPromise`, regardless of the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejectedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `rejectedPromise`, regardless of the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise that was created by the `defer` function, regardless of the state of the promise.

DONE.
