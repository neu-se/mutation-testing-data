  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the input string is not null, but replacing it with null would cause the check to always return false, even if the input string is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the input string is not null, but replacing it with undefined would cause the check to always return true, even if the input string is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the input string is not null, but replacing it with an empty string would cause the check to always return true, even if the input string is null.

DONE.
