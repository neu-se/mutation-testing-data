 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would cause a division by zero error when `a` is 0, while the original code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would always return a positive value, while the original code fragment can return a negative value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would square the value of `a`, while the original code fragment does not.

DONE.
