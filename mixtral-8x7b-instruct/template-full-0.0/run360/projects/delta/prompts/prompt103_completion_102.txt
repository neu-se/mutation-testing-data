 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(op => op !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out `null` values instead of using the provided predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(predicate).slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with the filtered elements and might not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(predicate).reverse()
