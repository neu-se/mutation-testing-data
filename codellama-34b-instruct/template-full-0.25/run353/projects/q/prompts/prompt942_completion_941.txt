  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `undefined` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `[]` is an empty array.

DONE.
