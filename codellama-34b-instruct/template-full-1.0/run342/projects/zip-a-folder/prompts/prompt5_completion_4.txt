  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && !targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition and reverse the check, resulting in the opposite outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || !targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the custom write stream option is defined, and if not, it would check if the target file path is not defined. This is different from the original behavior, which checked if the custom write stream option was not defined and the target file path was defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions === 'customWriteStream'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the zipAFolderOptions variable is equal to the string 'customWriteStream', rather than checking if the customWriteStream property of the zipAFolderOptions object is defined.

DONE.
