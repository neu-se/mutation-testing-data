  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, onUnhandledError)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the rejection handler to `onUnhandledError`, which could potentially handle the rejection differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the rejection handler to a no-op function, which would not handle the rejection at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, function (error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the rejection handler to a function that throws the error, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error.

DONE.
