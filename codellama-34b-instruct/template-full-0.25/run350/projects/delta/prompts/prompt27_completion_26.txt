  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `attributes` object is empty, while this replacement checks the length of the `attributes` object. If the `attributes` object has a length of 0, the original code would return `undefined`, while this replacement would return 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `attributes` object is empty, while this replacement checks the length of the `attributes` object using the `Object.keys()` method. If the `attributes` object has a length of 0, the original code would return `undefined`, while this replacement would return 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `attributes` object is empty, while this replacement checks the size of the `attributes`
