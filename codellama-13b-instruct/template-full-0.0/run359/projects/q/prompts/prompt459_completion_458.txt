  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `promise` is in the `unhandledRejections` array, while the buggy code fragment is checking if the `promise` is in the `unhandledRejections` array and the `promise` itself. This would result in a different behavior because the buggy code fragment would always return `true` if the `promise` is in the `unhandledRejections` array, regardless of whether it is also in the `promise` itself.
