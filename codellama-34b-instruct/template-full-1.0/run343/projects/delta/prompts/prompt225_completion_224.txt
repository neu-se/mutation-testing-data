  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `strings[1], strings[0], cursor`
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `strings` array in a different order, potentially causing the `diff` function to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `strings[0], strings[0], cursor`
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the same string as both arguments to the `diff` function, potentially causing it to return an empty result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `"test", "test", cursor`
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a constant string to the `diff` function, potentially causing it to return an empty result.

DONE.
