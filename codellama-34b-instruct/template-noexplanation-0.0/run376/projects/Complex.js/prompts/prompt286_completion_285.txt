  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which will in turn affect the calculation of the `sin` and `cos` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This change will also cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which will affect the calculation of the `sin` and `cos` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which will affect the calculation of the `sin` and `cos` functions.

DONE.
