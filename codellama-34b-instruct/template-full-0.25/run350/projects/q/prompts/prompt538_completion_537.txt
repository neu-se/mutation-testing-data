  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different method than `all`, and it would return a promise that resolves to the first promise in the array that is fulfilled, rather than waiting for all promises to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.some
```
This would result in different behavior because `some` is a different method than `all`, and it would return a promise that resolves to the first promise in the array that is fulfilled, rather than waiting for all promises to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` is a different method than `all`, and it would return a promise that resolves to the first promise in the array that is rejected, rather than waiting for all promises to be fulfilled.

DONE.
