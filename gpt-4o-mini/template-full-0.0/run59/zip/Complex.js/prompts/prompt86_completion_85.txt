Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === ' ' || isNaN(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks for a space or NaN, which would allow invalid tokens to be processed as valid, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to skip the check for the next token entirely, leading to potential errors when trying to access an undefined index, which could cause the parser to fail silently or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the next token to be 'i' or 'I' for the imaginary part, ignoring other valid numeric formats, which could lead to incorrect parsing of complex numbers that include valid numeric values followed by 'i'.

DONE.
