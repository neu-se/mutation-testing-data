 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the currentUrlStr to lowercase, which might not match the expected behavior in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr || ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces undefined with an empty string, which might not match the expected behavior in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.trim()
