  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code only checks if `a` is less than or equal to 0, it does not check if `b` is less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the code only checks if `a` is less than or equal to 0, it does not check if `b` is less than or equal to 0 and it also performs a multiplication with `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code only checks if `a` is less than or equal to 0, it does not check if `b` is less than or equal to 0 and it also performs an absolute value calculation with `b`.

DONE.
