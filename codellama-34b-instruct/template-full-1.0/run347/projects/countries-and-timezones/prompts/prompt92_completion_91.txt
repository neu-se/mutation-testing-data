  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `countryId` to uppercase, which could cause the `getCountry()` function to return a different country or no country at all if the `countryId` is not found in the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"abc123"
```
This would result in different behavior because the literal string `"abc123"` would be passed as the `countryId` to the `getCountry()` function, which could cause the function to return a different country or no country at all if the `countryId` is not found in the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the `countryId` to the `getCountry()` function, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of a country object.

DONE.
