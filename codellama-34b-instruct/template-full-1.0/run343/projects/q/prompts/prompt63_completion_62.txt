  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setImmediate` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, which is not a valid callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setImmediate` function would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which is not a valid callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a different function from `setImmediate`, and it would be called with the same arguments.

Conclusion: DONE.
