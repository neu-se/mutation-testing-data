  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` property of the `ctx` object is not the same as the `path` parameter passed to the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` property of the `ctx` object is not the same as the `verb` parameter passed to the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path + ctx.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of the `path` and `verb` properties of the `ctx` object is not the same as the concatenation of the `path` and `verb` parameters passed to the `query` method.

DONE.
