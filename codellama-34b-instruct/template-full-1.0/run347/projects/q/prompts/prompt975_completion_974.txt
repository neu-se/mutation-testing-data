  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(object, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to the `nodeArgs` variable, potentially causing the `npost` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to the `nodeArgs` variable, potentially causing the `npost` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to the `nodeArgs` variable, potentially causing the `npost` method to fail.

DONE.
