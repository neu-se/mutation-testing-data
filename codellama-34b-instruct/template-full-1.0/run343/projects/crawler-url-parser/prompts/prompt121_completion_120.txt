  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.to
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.to` is not a valid method in JavaScript, and the code would throw a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` is a method that returns a promise that resolves when all the promises in the array have resolved. The original code snippet uses `Array.map` to transform each item in the array into a promise, but `Promise.all` would not work in this scenario.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from([1, 2, 3], x => x * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.from` method creates a new array from a given object or array, while the original code snippet uses `Array.map` to transform each item in the array.

DONE.
