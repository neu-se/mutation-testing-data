  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 1, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the value `1` instead of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void rejected, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the value `undefined` instead of `rejected`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void myFunction(), undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the return value of the function `myFunction` instead of `undefined`.

DONE.
