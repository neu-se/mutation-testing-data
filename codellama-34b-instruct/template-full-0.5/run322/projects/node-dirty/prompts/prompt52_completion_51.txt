  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value associated with the key, rather than the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value associated with the key that is one greater than the original key, rather than the original key itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) || this._data.get(key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key, or if that value is undefined, it would return the value associated with the key that is one greater than the original key.

DONE.
