  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fapply` method to always call the `apply` method on the `Promise` object, regardless of the value of the `object` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fapply` method to always call the `apply` method on the `Promise` object, regardless of the value of the `object` argument, and it would also skip the first argument of the `apply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

this.dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fapply` method to always
