  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `currentUrlStr` to lowercase, which could potentially change the outcome of the URL parsing and cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `baseUrlStr` to lowercase, which could potentially change the outcome of the URL parsing and cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `currentUrlStr` to uppercase, which could potentially change the outcome of the URL parsing and cause the test to fail.

DONE.
