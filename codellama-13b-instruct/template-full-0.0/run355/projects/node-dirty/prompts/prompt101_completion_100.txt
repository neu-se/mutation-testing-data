  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.val` property is now checked for `null` instead of `undefined`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the `row.val` property is actually `null` instead of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.val` property is now checked for `0` instead of `undefined`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the `row.val` property is actually `0` instead of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.val` property is now checked for `false` instead of `undefined`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the `row.val`
