  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `options`, which refers to the `options` object passed to the `writeFileSync` function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` because `null` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `options`, which refers to the `options` object passed to the `writeFileSync` function. Replacing it with an empty object `{}` would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` because the `fs.writeFileSync` method requires a non-empty object as its second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `options`, which refers to the `options` object passed to the `writeFileSync` function. Replacing it with `undefined` would
