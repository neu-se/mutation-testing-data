  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method expects a function to be passed as the first argument, which would be called with the resolved value of the promise. Using `rejected` instead would result in a `TypeError` because `rejected` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method expects a function to be passed as the first argument, which would be called with the resolved value of the promise. Using `undefined` instead would result in a `TypeError` because `undefined` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method expects a function to be passed as the first argument, which would be called with the resolved value of the promise. Using `null` instead would result in a `TypeError` because `null` is not a function.
