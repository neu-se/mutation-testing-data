  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the `apply` function from the global context to the current context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the `call` function from the global context to the current context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to the current context and `arguments` object, instead of being called directly in the global context.

DONE.
