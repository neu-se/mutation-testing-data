  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `!` operator to check if the `timezones[name]` property exists, while this code fragment uses the `=== undefined` comparison to check if the property is undefined. If the property is undefined, the original code would return `true`, while this code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `!` operator to check if the `timezones[name]` property exists, while this code fragment uses the `!== null` comparison to check if the property is not null. If the property is null, the original code would return `true`, while this code fragment would return `false`.
