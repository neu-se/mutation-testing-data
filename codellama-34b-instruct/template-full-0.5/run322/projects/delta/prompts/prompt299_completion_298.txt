  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the characters in the string, while `line` simply returns the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` converts the string to uppercase, while `line` simply returns the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(1)` returns the substring starting from the second character, while `line` simply returns the string.

DONE.
