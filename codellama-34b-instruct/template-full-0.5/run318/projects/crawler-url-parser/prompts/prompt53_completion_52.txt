  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl, parsedBaseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.hostname, parsedUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the hostname property is being used instead of the host property, which could cause the function to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.pathname, parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the pathname property is being used instead of the path property, which could cause the function to produce different results.

DONE.
