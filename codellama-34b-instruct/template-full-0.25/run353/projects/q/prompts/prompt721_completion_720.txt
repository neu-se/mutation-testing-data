  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve()` method is called with the `promises` array instead of the `promises` array with the resolved values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject()` method is called with the `promises` array instead of the `promises` array with the resolved values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify()` method is called with the `promises` array instead of the `promises` array with the resolved values.

DONE.
