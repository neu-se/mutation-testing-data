  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue = <PLACEHOLDER>(resolvedPromise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nearerValue` variable to be assigned the result of calling the `resolvedPromise` function with the `PLACEHOLDER` value as an argument, rather than the result of calling the `resolvedPromise` function with the `promise` value as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue = <PLACEHOLDER>(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nearerValue` variable to be assigned the result of calling the `resolvedPromise` function with the `promise` value as an argument, rather than the result of calling the `resolvedPromise` function with the `PLACEHOLDER` value as an argument.
