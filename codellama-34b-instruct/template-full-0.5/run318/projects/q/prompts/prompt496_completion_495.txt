  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the rejection is an object, while the new code fragment checks if the rejection is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the rejection is an object, while the new code fragment checks if the rejection is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the rejection is an object, while the new code fragment checks if the rejection has a reason property.

DONE.
