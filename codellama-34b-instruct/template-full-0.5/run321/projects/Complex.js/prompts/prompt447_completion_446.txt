  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is being multiplied by `places` instead of `im`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is being divided by `places` instead of multiplied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is being divided by `places` instead of multiplied.

DONE.
