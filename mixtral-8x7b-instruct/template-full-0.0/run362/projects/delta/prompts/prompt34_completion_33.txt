 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is null, instead of checking if `a` is not an object. This could cause unexpected results if `a` is assigned a non-object value like a number or a boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof a !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is not undefined, instead of checking if `a` is not an object. This could cause unexpected results if `a` is assigned an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is an array, instead of checking if `a` is an object. This could cause unexpected results if `a` is an array or a primitive value.

By introducing these changes, we can expose potential weaknesses in the test
