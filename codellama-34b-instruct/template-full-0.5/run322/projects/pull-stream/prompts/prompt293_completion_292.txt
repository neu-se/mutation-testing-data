  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `test` is a number, but this replacement checks if it is a string. This could cause the function to produce different results or errors depending on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'boolean' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `test` is a number, but this replacement checks if it is a boolean. This could cause the function to produce different results or errors depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `test` is a number, but this replacement checks if it is a function. This could cause the function to produce different results or errors depending on the input.

DONE.
