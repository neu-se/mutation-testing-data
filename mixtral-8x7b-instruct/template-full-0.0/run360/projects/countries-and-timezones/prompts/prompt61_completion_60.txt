 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive `null` as its argument instead of the expected data object. This could cause the function to throw an error or return incorrect results, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive the result of `data + 1` as its argument, which is likely not a valid input for the function. This could cause the function to throw an error or return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(data)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive the first key of the `data` object as its argument instead of the entire object. This could cause the function to return incorrect results, depending on how it is implemented.

DONE.
