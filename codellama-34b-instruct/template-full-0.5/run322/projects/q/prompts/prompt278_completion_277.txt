  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified, rather than resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled, rather than resolved or rejected.

DONE.
