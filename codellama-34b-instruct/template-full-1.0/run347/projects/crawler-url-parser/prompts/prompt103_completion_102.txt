  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(" " + text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `text` is in `tmpUrl.text`, while this modified code fragment checks if `text` is in `tmpUrl.text` without any leading spaces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.domain == "stackoverflow.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the link is in the same domain as the page, while this modified code fragment checks if the link is in a specific domain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.path.includes("/generate_204")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the link is in the same path as the page, while this modified code fragment checks if the link contains a specific path.

DONE.
