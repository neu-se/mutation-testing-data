  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split('/').pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last segment of the path, potentially changing the level of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path[0].toUpperCase() + pageurl_path.slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would capitalize the first character of the path, which could change the level of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the path, rather than the path itself, which could change the level of the URL.

DONE.
