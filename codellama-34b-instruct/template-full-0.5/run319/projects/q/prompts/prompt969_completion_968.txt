  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `npost` is a method of the `Promise` prototype, and using `bind` would change the `this` context of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would set the `this` context of the function to `object`, which is not the same as `Q(object)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` would set the `this` context of the function to `object`, which is not the same as `Q(object)`.

DONE.
