  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This change inverts the condition of the ternary operator, so that the `null` value is returned when `abort` is `true`, and `abort` is returned when `abort` is `false`. This change in behavior could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function, as it may not expect the `null` value to be returned in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : abort
```
This change keeps the original behavior of the ternary operator, but changes the condition to always return `null` when `abort` is `true`. This change could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function, as it may not expect the `null` value to be returned in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
