Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().resolve` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Q.defer` creates a pending promise. This change would cause the `put` method to always resolve the promise, rather than rejecting it with the
