  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not a valid timezone name, and the function would throw an error if it was passed null instead of a valid timezone name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is not a valid timezone name, and the function would throw an error if it was passed undefined instead of a valid timezone name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because {} is not a valid timezone name, and the function would throw an error if it was passed an empty object instead of a valid timezone name.

DONE.
