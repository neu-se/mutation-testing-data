  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `/` operator to split the path into components, while the replaced code uses the `\` operator, which would result in different components being extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `/` operator to split the path into components, while the replaced code uses the `\\` operator, which would result in different components being extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `/` operator to split the path into components, while the replaced code uses the `/` operator, which would result in the same components being extracted. However, the replaced code would also include the `/` characters in the extracted components, which would not be the case with the original code.

DONE.
