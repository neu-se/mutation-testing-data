  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now replace any occurrence of "/" with "\\/" instead of just "/".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now remove any occurrence of "/" instead of replacing it with "\\/".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\/default"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now replace any occurrence of "/default" with "\\/default" instead of just "/".

DONE.
