  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is a method, and `this.dispatch.bind(this)` is a bound method, which would change the value of `this` inside the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is a method, and `this.dispatch.call(null)` is a method call with a null context, which would change the value of `this` inside the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is a method, and `this.dispatch.apply(null)` is a method call with a null context, which would change the value of `this` inside the method.

DONE.
