  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would test whether the value is not an object, whereas the original code tested whether it is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would test whether the value is undefined, whereas the original code tested whether it is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would test whether the value is not null, whereas the original code tested whether it is an object.

DONE.
