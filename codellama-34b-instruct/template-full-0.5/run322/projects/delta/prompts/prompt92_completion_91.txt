  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, so the `else` block would never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, so the `if` block would never be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, so the `if` block would always be executed, even if `index` is equal to `this.ops.length`.

DONE.
