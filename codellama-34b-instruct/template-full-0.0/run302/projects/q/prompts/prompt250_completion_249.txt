  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string would start with a tab character instead of a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the string would start with a space character instead of a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the string would be empty instead of containing a newline character.

DONE.
