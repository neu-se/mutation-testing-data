  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(module.js:") !== -1 ||
```
This would result in different behavior because the "module.js" part of the stack trace would be ignored, potentially hiding relevant information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(node.js:") !== -1 ||
```
This would result in different behavior because the "node.js" part of the stack trace would be ignored, potentially hiding relevant information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(module.js:") !== -1 &&
```
This would result in different behavior because the "module.js" part of the stack trace would be ignored, potentially hiding relevant information.

DONE.
