  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the length of the next operation from the other iterator instead of the current iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the length of the current operation instead of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(otherIter.peek())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the length of the next operation from the other iterator without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
