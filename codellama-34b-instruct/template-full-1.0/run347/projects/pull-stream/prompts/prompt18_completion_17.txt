  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operation would change the value of `read`, potentially causing the function to produce an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operation would change the value of `read`, potentially causing the function to produce an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operation would change the value of `read`, potentially causing the function to produce an incorrect result.

DONE.
