  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes an element from the delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds an element to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains an element in the delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds an element to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that concatenates two deltas, whereas `push` is a method that adds an element to the delta.

DONE.
