 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` to the callback, while the buggy version passes `null`, which might cause issues if the calling code expects a non-null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` as-is to the callback, while the buggy version converts it to a string, which might cause issues if the calling code expects a specific data type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<empty string>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` to the callback, while the buggy version passes an empty string, which might cause issues if the calling code expects a non-empty value.

DONE.
