  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would reject the promise immediately, whereas `Q` would not have any effect on the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` would resolve the promise immediately, whereas `Q` would not have any effect on the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` would create a new deferred object, whereas `Q` would not have any effect on the promise.

DONE.
