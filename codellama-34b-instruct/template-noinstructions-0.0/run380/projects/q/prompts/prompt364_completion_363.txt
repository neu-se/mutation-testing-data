  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, and it would cause the `then` method to return a promise that is resolved with the value `undefined`, which is different from the original behavior where the promise is resolved with the value `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, and it would cause the `then` method to return a promise that is resolved with the value `null`, which is different from the original behavior where the promise is resolved with the value `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to return a promise that is rejected with the error "error", which is different from the original behavior where the promise is resolved with the value `value`.

DONE.
