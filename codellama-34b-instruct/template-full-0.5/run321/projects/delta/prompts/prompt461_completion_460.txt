  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a concatenation of the `next` element with the slice of the `ops` array starting from the current `index` + 1, whereas the original code fragment returns a concatenation of the `next` element with the slice of the `ops` array starting from the current `index`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a concatenation of the `next` element with the slice of the `ops` array starting from the current `index` + 2, whereas the original code fragment returns a concatenation of the `next` element with the slice of the `ops` array starting from the current `index`.
