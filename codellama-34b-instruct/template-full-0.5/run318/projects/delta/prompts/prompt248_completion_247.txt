  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the length of the other iterator instead of the this iterator, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the length of the this iterator plus one, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the length of the this iterator minus one, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
