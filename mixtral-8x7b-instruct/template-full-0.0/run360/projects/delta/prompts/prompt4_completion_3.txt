 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would now use the `a` object as the base object for merging attributes, instead of the `b` object. This could lead to unexpected behavior when merging attribute maps.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would always start with an empty object as the base for merging attributes, regardless of the input `a` and `b` objects. This could lead to loss of attributes from the `a` object if the `b` object does not have the same attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.assign({}, a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would use `Object.assign` to merge the `a` and `b` objects, instead of creating a deep clone and manually merging the
