  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('The database is not dirty')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the test suite would not be able to detect the issue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('The database is too dirty')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the test suite would not be able to detect the issue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('The database is not clean')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the test suite would not be able to detect the issue.

DONE.
