  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg !== arg
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg !== arg` is always false, so the `if` block would never be executed, even if the argument is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1 === arg
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg + 1 === arg` is always false, so the `if` block would never be executed, even if the argument is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1 === arg
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg - 1 === arg` is always false, so the `if` block would never be executed, even if the argument is a number.

DONE.
