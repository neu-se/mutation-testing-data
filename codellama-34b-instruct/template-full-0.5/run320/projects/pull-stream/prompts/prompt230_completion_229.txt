  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will invert the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is now being called with `data` as an argument, which may cause the function to behave differently depending on the value of `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is now being called with two arguments, which may cause the function to behave differently depending on the values of `data` and `data`.

DONE.
