  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject(error)` only if the given promise rejects, while this new code fragment would always reject the promise with the given error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.resolve(value)` only if the given promise resolves, while this new code fragment would always resolve the promise with the given error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.notify(error)` only if the given promise notifies, while this new code fragment would always notify the promise with the given error.

DONE.
