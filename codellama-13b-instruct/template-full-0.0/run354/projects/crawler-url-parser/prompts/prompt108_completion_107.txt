  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` object is now being accessed using the `url` property instead of the entire object. This could potentially cause issues if the `url` property is not defined or if it is not a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` object is now being accessed using the `protocol` property instead of the entire object. This could potentially cause issues if the `protocol` property is not defined or if it is not a valid protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` object is now being accessed using the `host` property instead of the entire object. This could potentially cause issues if the `host` property is not defined or if it is not a valid hostname.

DONE.
