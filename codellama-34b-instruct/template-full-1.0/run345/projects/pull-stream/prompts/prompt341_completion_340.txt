  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the negation of the original value, instead of storing the key in the seen object and returning true if the key was already seen.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always store the key in the seen object as false, instead of true, which would cause the function to return true for all keys that were already seen.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = !seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the value of the key in the seen object, instead of storing the key as true if it was already seen.

DONE.
