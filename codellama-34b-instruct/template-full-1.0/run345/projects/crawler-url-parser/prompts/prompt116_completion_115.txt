  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.values(extract(data, sourceUrl)))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `extract` function inside the loop, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.values(<PLACEHOLDER>))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different argument to the `values` function, which would cause the loop to iterate over a different set of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.values({}))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty object to the `values` function, which would cause the loop to iterate over no values at all.

DONE.
