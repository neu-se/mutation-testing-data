 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the loop counter instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to iterate in reverse order or not terminate if the initial value of i is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always increments the loop counter by 1, skipping every other element in the arguments array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the next argument instead of incrementing the loop counter, causing an "index out of bounds" error if there is no next argument.

DONE.
