Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the `closed` promise when an error occurs, it would reject it, potentially causing any consumers of the `closed` promise to handle the rejection instead of the resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the error to the console instead of resolving the `closed` promise, which means that the error would not be propagated as part of the queue's closure behavior, potentially leading to unhandled errors in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the `ends` promise with the error instead of resolving the `closed` promise, which could lead to incorrect handling of the queue state and miscommunication about whether the queue is closed or still operational.

DONE.
