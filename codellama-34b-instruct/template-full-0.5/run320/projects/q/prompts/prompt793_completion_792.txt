  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() { throw new Error(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, instead of being resolved with the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() { return undefined; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined`, instead of being resolved with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() { return null; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `null`, instead of being resolved with the original value.

DONE.
