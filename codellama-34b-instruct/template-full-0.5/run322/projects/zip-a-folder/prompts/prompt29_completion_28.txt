  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called instead of the `resolve` function, which would cause the promise to reject instead of resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown instead of the promise being resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log` statement would log a message to the console instead of resolving or rejecting the promise.

DONE.
