  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(attributes).length` returns the number of keys in the `attributes` object, whereas `attributes` returns the object itself. This change would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `attributes` object is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(attributes).length > 0` checks if the `attributes` object has at least one key, whereas `attributes` returns the object itself. This change would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `attributes` object is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(attributes).length === 0` checks if the `attributes
