  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to return the incorrect plural form for the word "person".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peeps'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to return a nonsensical plural form for the word "person".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to return the correct plural form for the word "person".

DONE.
