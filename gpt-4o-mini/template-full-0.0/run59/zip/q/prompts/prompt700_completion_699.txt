Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, rather than concatenating it with the new arguments, which means the original `args` will not be included in the final array passed to `dispatch`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.reverse()` modifies the `args` array in place and returns the reversed array, which changes the order of the arguments passed to `dispatch`, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because using `arguments` directly refers to all arguments passed to the function, rather than just the `args` array, which could lead to including unintended arguments in the call to `dispatch`.

DONE.
