  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be multiplying the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding the value of `places` to the real part of the complex number instead of multiplying it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding the value of `places` to the imaginary part of the complex number instead of multiplying it.

DONE.
