  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> ? passed : failed).push(op);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the ternary operator to push the `op` object to either the `passed` or `failed` array based on the result of the predicate function, while the modified code fragment always pushes the `op` object to the `passed` array.
