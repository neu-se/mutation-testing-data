  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
``` 
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different string than "next," and it would cause the generator to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"prev"
``` 
This would result in different behavior because "prev" is a different string than "next," and it would cause the generator to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spread[this, all(arguments)]
``` 
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to spread the arguments as a promise, rather than just passing them as-is.

DONE.
