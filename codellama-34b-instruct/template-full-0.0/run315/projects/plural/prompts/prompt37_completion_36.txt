  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the rule to words that end with "x" or "ch", while this new code fragment applies the rule to words that end with "x", "ch", or "s".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment applies the rule to words that end with "x" or "ch", while this new code fragment applies the rule to words that end with "x", "ch", or "s".
