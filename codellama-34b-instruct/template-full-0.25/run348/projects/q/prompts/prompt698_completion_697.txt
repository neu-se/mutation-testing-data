  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, instead of an array with the remaining arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the last element removed, instead of an array with the remaining arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the last element removed, instead of an array with the remaining arguments.

DONE.
