  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is the value of the row, while `row.key` is the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string 'foo' to the key, which would change the behavior of the `set` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key to `null`, which would change the behavior of the `get` method.

DONE.
