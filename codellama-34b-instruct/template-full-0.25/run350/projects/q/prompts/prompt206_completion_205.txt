  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the existence of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable, while this replacement checks for its value to be null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof fileNameAndLineNumber === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the existence of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable, while this replacement checks for its type to be undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the existence of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable, while this replacement checks for its length to be 0.

DONE.
