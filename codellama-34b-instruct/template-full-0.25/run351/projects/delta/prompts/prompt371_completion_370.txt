  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next(2))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called on a different iterator, which would cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.peek())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is called instead of the `next` method, which would cause the iterator to return a different value.

DONE.
