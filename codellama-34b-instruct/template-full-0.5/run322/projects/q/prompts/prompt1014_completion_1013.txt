  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function, whereas `null` is a primitive value. This would cause the code to throw an error when trying to call the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function, whereas `undefined` is a primitive value. This would cause the code to throw an error when trying to call the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function, whereas `() => {}` is a function expression. This would cause the code to execute the function expression instead of the original function, potentially changing the behavior of the code.

DONE.
