  
Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
Q_return(void)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q_return` is not a function in the scope of the original code, and it will cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning a promise, the function would throw an exception.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning a promise, the function would return `undefined`.

DONE.
