  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, and the `rejected` parameter is not a function, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is resolved or rejected, and the `progress` parameter is not a function, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is resolved or rejected, and the `fulfilled` parameter is not a function, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
