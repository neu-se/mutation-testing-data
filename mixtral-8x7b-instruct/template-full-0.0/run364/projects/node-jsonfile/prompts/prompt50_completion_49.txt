 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment writes the string to the file and returns the number of bytes written, while this replacement would return `undefined` (since `fs.writeFileSync` doesn't return a value).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.appendFileSync(file, str, options)
