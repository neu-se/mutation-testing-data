  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Missing key in database'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error with a different message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Corrupted data in database'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Inconsistent data in database'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error with a different message.

DONE.
