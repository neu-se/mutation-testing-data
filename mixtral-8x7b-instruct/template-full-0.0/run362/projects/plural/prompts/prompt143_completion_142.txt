 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the string representation of the regex pattern with the word, instead of using the regex.test() method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the constructor name of the regex pattern with the word, instead of using the regex.test() method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first match of the regex pattern with the word, instead of using the regex.test() method.

DONE.
