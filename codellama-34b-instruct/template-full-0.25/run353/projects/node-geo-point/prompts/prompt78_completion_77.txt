  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 180
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, and multiplying it by 180 would result in a random longitude value, which would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.PI / 180) * longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI / 180` is a constant value that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and multiplying it by the longitude value would result in a different angle, which would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 10 to the longitude value would result in a different angle, which would cause the `calcul
