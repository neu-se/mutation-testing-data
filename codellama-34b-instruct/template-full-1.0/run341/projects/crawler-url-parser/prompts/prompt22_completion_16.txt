  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#/g, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a negative lookahead assertion to ensure that the string does not start with a protocol, while this replacement would replace any occurrence of "#" with "http://", ignoring the protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//g, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a negative lookahead assertion to ensure that the string does not start with a protocol, while this replacement would replace any occurrence of "/" with "http://", ignoring the protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.\//g, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a negative lookahead assertion to ensure that the string does not start with a protocol, while this replacement would replace any occurrence of "./" with "http://", ignoring the protocol.

DONE.
