 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would receive `null` as the first argument instead of `cb`, potentially causing it to behave unexpectedly or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, true, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would receive `true` as the second argument instead of `abort`, potentially causing it to behave differently if it checks the value of this argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, 'incorrect value'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would receive a string as the third argument instead of a function, potentially causing it to behave unexpectedly or throw an error.

DONE.
