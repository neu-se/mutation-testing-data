  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `1` if `places` is falsy, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `10^1` instead of `10^0` if `places` is `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `-1` if `places` is falsy, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `10^-1` instead of `10^0` if `places` is `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `Infinity` if `places` is falsy, which would cause the `Math.pow` function
