  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!object.hasOwnProperty('longitude' && 'latitude')) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has both the 'longitude' and 'latitude' properties, but not if they are both numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!object.hasOwnProperty('longitude' || 'latitude')) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has either the 'longitude' or 'latitude' property, but not if both are present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (object.hasOwnProperty('longitude') !== object.hasOwnProperty('latitude')) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has both the 'longitude' and 'latitude' properties, but would also check if they are both present.

DONE.
