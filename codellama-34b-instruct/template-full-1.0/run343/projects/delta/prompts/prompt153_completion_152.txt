  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other.ops.length` check would always return `true`, causing the loop to run infinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext && thisIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check `thisIter.hasNext` would ensure that the loop only runs when both iterators have more elements to traverse.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext && thisIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check `thisIter.peekType() !== 'delete'` would ensure that the loop only runs when the next element in `thisIter` is not a delete operation.

DONE.
