 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.timezones[tzName]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `timezones` object using the `tzName` instead of using the `getTimezone` function. This could lead to unexpected results if the `tzName` does not exist in the `timezones` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
getTimezone('fake_tzName')
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the timezone with the name 'fake_tzName' instead of the actual timezone passed in the `tzName` variable. This could lead to incorrect results when calling `getCountriesForTimezone`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
timezones['wrong_property']
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access a non-existent property 'wrong_property' in the `timezones` object. This would return
