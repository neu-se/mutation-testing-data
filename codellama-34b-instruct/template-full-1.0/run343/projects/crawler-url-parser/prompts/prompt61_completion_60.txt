  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl) + "?test=123"
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a query parameter to the URL, which would cause the test suite to fail if it's not properly testing for query parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse("https://example.com")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to be passed a different URL, which would likely cause the test suite to fail if it's not properly testing for URL parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return `null`, which would likely cause the test suite to fail if it's not properly testing for error handling.

DONE.
