  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` is a function that checks if a stack line is from Node.js, and it would cause the `filterStackString` function to filter out stack lines that are from Node.js, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber
```
This would result in different behavior because `getFileNameAndLineNumber` is a function that extracts the file name and line number from a stack line, and it would cause the `filterStackString` function to filter out stack lines that have a file name and line number, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a function that checks if a value is a promise-like object, and it would cause the `coerce` function to coerce promise-like objects to
