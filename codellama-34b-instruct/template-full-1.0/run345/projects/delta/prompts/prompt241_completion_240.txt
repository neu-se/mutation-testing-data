  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.opeLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current op, rather than the length of the next op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `isEqual` function to compare the next op with the current op, rather than just checking if the length of the next op is greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `equals` flag to `true`, even if the next op is not equal to the current op.

DONE.
