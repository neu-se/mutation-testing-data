  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the second argument instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments), 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments)` would create a new array from the `arguments` object, and then the slice would be taken from the second element of the new array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(1)` would take a slice of the `arguments` object starting from the second element, instead of starting from the first element.

DONE.
