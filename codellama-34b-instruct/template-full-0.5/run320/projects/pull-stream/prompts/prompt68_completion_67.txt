  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a different function than `console.warn`, and it would not produce the same output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` is a different function than `console.warn`, and it would not produce the same output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.info` is a different function than `console.warn`, and it would not produce the same output.

DONE.
