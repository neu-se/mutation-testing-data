  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if an object has a property with the given name, whereas `uncurryThis` is a function that converts a function that takes an object as its first argument into a function that takes the object as its last argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `uncurryThis` is a function that converts a function that takes an object as its first argument into a function that takes the object as its last argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Function.prototype.call)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.prototype.call` is
