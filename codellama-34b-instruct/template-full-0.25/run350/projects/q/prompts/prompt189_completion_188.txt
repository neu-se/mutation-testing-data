  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` would convert a string to a number, while the new code fragment `"0"` would always return the number 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` would convert a string to a number, while the new code fragment `null` would always return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` would convert a string to a number, while the new code fragment `undefined` would always return undefined.

DONE.
