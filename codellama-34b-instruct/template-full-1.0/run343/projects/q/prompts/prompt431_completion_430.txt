  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the `inspect` function on the `rejection` promise, rather than the `inspect` function on the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(rejected).then(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new resolved promise with the value of `rejected`, and then immediately reject it with the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.rejected(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rejected promise with the given `reason`, rather than returning the existing rejected promise.

DONE.
