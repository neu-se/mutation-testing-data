  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the multiplication operator, but this replacement uses the division operator, which could result in different results when `c` is zero or a very small number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the multiplication operator, but this replacement uses the addition operator, which could result in different results when `c` is a large number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the multiplication operator, but this replacement uses the multiplication operator with the same operands, which could result in a different result when `c` has a non-zero imaginary part.

DONE.
