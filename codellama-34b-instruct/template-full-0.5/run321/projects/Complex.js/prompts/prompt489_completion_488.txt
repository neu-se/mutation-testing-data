  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, which could cause issues if the return value is used in other parts of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, which could cause issues if the return value is used in other parts of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, which could cause issues if the return value is used in other parts of the code.

DONE.
