  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` is a function that checks if a value is a promise, and negating it would cause the code to treat non-promise values as if they were promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat all values as if they were promises, even if they are not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat all values as if they were promises, even if they are not.

DONE.
