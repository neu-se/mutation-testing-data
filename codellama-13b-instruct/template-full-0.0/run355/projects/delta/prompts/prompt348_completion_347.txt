  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to the `transform` method is now `1`, which is not a valid argument for the `transform` method. This would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to the `transform` method is now `null`, which is not a valid argument for the `transform` method. This would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to the `transform` method is now `undefined`, which is not a valid argument for the `transform` method. This would cause the method to throw an error.

DONE.
