 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function wrapping `cb()` ensures that it is always executed, even if the callback list is empty or the callback is not a function. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the original code intended to handle cases where the callback is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setImmediate
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a function that schedules the invocation of a callback to occur at the end of the current event loop iteration or as soon as possible. Replacing the callback with `setImmediate` would cause the callback to be invoked asynchronously, which might not be the intended behavior. Moreover, the original code would not provide any arguments to the `setImmediate` function, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.set(key, val, cb)
