  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would not be called, and the stack trace of the `error` object would not be modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack + "\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n" + promise.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace of the `error` object would be concatenated with the stack trace of the `promise` object, and the `STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR` string would be inserted between them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack.split("\n")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because only the first line of the stack trace of the `error` object would be used, and the rest of the stack trace would be discarded.

DONE.
