  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because `!object` would always return `true` if `object` is not defined, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `object` has the properties `latitude` and `longitude`, but it would not check if they are numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object.latitude === 'number' && typeof object.longitude === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the properties `latitude` and `longitude` are numbers, but it would not check if `object` has those properties.

DONE.
