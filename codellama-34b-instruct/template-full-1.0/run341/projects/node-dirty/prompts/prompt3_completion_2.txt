  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val == null
```
This would result in different behavior because val == null would also match null and undefined, while val === undefined only matches undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because val !== undefined would always return true, even if val is null or undefined, while val === undefined only matches undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val != null
```
This would result in different behavior because val != null would match any value that is not null or undefined, while val === undefined only matches undefined.

DONE.
