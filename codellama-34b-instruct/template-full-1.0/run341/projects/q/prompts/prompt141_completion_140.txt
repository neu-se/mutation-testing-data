  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while(p){p=p.source;}
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the assignment `p = p.source` is always true, causing the loop to never exit.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source+1
```
This would result in a different value for `p` than the original code because it adds 1 to the value of `p.source`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p=0
```
This would result in a different value for `p` than the original code because it assigns the value 0 to p, rather than the value of `p.source`.

DONE.
