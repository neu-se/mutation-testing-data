Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the length by 1, potentially causing the code to attempt to process one more operation than intended, leading to incorrect handling of the delta operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, which could lead to mismatched operations being processed and incorrect results in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decreases the length by 1, which may cause the code to skip processing the last operation of `otherIter`, potentially resulting in data loss or incorrect delta composition.

DONE.
