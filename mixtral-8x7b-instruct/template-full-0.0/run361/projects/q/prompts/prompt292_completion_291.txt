 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called instead of `deferred.notify`, potentially causing the promise to be resolved or rejected prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
