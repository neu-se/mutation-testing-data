  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the imaginary part of the complex number by the number of places, rather than the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the real part of the complex number by the number of places, rather than multiplying it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the imaginary part of the complex number by the number of places, rather than multiplying it.

DONE.
