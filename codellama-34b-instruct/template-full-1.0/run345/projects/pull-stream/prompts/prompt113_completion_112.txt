  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err) return cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `err` argument is truthy before calling the callback with an error, while this new code fragment only checks if `err` is defined before calling the callback with an error. If `err` is a falsey value such as `null` or `false`, the original code fragment would call the callback with an error, while this new code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err) return cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with just an error argument if the `err` argument is truthy, while this new code fragment calls the callback with `null` as the first argument regardless of whether `err` is truthy or falsey.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err) return cb(acc, err)
```
This would result in different
