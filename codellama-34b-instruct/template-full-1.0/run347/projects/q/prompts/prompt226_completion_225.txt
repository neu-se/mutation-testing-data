  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q.nextTick(function () {
                resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(resolvedPromise, args);
            });"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be executing the opposite of what it is supposed to do, it would be resolving the promise rather than rejecting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q.nextTick(function () {
                resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(resolvedPromise, args);
            });"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be executing the same task but in a different context, instead of being executed as part of the promise resolution, it would be executed as part of the promise fulfillment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q.nextTick(function () {
                resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(resolvedPromise, args);
            });"
```
This would result
