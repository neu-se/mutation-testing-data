  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` operator negates the result of `this['isNaN']()`, so if the original code fragment is `this['isNaN']()`, the mutated code fragment would be `!this['isNaN']()`, which would return `false` if the original code fragment returned `true`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isFinite']()` checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while `this['isNaN']()` checks if the complex number is not on the Riemann sphere. So, if the original code fragment is `this['isNaN']()`, the mutated code fragment would be `this['isFinite']()`, which would return `true` if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, and vice versa.
