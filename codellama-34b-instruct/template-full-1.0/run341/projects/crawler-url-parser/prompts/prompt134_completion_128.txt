  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.(jpeg)$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression only matches URLs that end with `./default.jpe` while the new one would also match URLs that end with `./default.jpeg`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[png|jpg|gif]$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression only matches URLs that end with `./default.jpe` while the new one would also match URLs that end with `./default.jpg` and `./default.gif`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\d+\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression only matches URLs that end with `./default.jpe` while the new one would also match URLs that end with `./default0.jpe` and `./default1.jpeg`.
