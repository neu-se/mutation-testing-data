  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `reducer` function expects to receive two arguments, `acc` and `data`, but it is being called with only one argument, `acc`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `reducer` function expects to receive two arguments, `acc` and `data`, but it is being called with only one argument, `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data + reducer(acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `reducer` function expects to receive two arguments, `acc` and `data`, but it is being called with only one
