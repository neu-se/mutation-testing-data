  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack && (!error.__minimumStackCounter__ || error.__minimumStackCounter__ < p.stackCounter)
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed from `>` to `<`, which would cause the `stackCounter` to be incremented even if the error has a smaller stack counter than the previous promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack && (!error.__minimumStackCounter__ || error.__minimumStackCounter__ !== p.stackCounter)
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed from `>` to `!==`, which would cause the `stackCounter` to be incremented even if the error has a different stack counter than the previous promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack && (!error.__minimumStackCounter__ || error.__minimumStackCounter__ >= p.stackCounter)
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed from `
