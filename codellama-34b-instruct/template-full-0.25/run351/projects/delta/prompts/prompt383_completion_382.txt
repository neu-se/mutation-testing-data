  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of two numbers, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the index from the offset, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest of two numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the offset from the index, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest of two numbers.

DONE.
