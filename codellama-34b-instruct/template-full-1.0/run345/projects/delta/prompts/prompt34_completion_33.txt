  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a is undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'undefined'` instead of `'object'`, which would cause the conditional block to execute even if `a` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a is null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'object'` instead of `'undefined'`, which would cause the conditional block to execute even if `a` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would compare the values of `a` and `b` instead of their types, which would cause the conditional block to execute even if `a` and `b` are not equal.

DONE.
