  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj` is a different object than `obj, options`, and `stringify` would produce a different output for the two objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options
```
This would result in different behavior because `options` is an object with different properties than `obj, options`, and `stringify` would produce a different output for the two objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` would produce a different output for the parsed object than `stringify` would for the original object.

DONE.
