  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` would always be `false`, causing the `if` statement to execute the `else` clause, even if `end` was originally `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` would always be `true`, causing the `if` statement to execute the `if` clause, even if `end` was originally `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` would be inverted, causing the `if` statement to execute the `if` clause when `end` was originally `false`, and the `else` clause when `end` was originally `true`.

DONE.
