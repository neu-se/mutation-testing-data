  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object with `null` as the promise value, instead of using the existing deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object with `false` as the promise value, instead of using the existing deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object with `0` as the promise value, instead of using the existing deferred object.

DONE.
