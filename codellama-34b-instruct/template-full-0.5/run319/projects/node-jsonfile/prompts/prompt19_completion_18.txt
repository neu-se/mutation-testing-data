  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new string, and the original code fragment passed the `file` variable directly to the `readFileSync()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `file` variable, which is a string, to the `readFileSync()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + ".json"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `file` variable directly to the `readFileSync()` method, without appending the ".json" extension.

DONE.
