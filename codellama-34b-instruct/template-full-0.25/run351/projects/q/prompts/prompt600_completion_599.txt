  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `args` array starting from the second element, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `args` array with the value `1`, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array in reverse order, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

DONE.
