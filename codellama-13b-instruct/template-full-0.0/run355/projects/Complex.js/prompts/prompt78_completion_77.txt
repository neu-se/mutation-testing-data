  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of index 0, which could cause the code to skip the first token in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would continue until the index is greater than or equal to the length of the array, which could cause the code to access an index that is out of bounds and cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < tokens.length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop one index before the end of the array, which could cause the code to miss the last token in the array.

DONE.
