  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join` returns a path string, while `path.resolve` returns an absolute path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.sep
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.sep` returns a platform-specific path separator, while `path.resolve` returns an absolute path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.normalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.normalize` returns a normalized path string, while `path.resolve` returns an absolute path.

DONE.
