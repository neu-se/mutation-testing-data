  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the original value, and it would also call the `noop` function with the original value as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop, noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the original value, and it would also call the `noop` function with the original value as an argument, and it would also call the `noop` function with the original value as an argument.

DONE.
