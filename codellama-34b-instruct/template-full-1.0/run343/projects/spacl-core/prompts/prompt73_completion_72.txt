  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, null, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `null` instead of evaluating the rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `null` instead of evaluating the context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `null` instead of evaluating the rules and context.

DONE.
