Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with a `null` value instead of terminating the read process, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the end of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the current value of `ended` to the callback, which may not be the intended behavior when the stream is supposed to terminate, leading to unexpected results in the consumer of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
terminate(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `terminate` function with a `null` argument instead of the expected error or boolean value, which could cause the termination logic to behave incorrectly or not as intended.

DONE.
