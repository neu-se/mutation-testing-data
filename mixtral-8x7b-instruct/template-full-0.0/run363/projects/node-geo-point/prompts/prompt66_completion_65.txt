 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` only takes one argument, while `atan2` takes two. This change would cause the y and x values to be passed as separate arguments to `Math.atan`, which would lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(x, y)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the x and y arguments is reversed. The original `atan2` function takes the y-coordinate as the first argument and the x-coordinate as the second argument, while this change would swap their positions. This would cause the function to calculate the wrong angle, leading to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(1, y / x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a
