  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This change will cause the function to return `true` for all inputs greater than or equal to `max`, instead of just greater than `max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This change will cause the function to return `true` for all inputs less than `max`, instead of just greater than `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === max
```
This change will cause the function to return `true` for all inputs that are equal to `max`, instead of just greater than `max`.

DONE.
