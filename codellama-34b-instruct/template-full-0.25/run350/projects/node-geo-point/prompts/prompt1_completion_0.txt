  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === NaN || longitude === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` are not numbers, while this new code fragment checks if they are equal to `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === null || longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` are not numbers, while this new code fragment checks if they are equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === undefined || longitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` are not numbers, while this new code fragment checks if they are equal to `undefined`.

DONE.
