  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new copy of the `rules` array instead of using the existing one, which could affect the behavior of the `matches` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `rules` array instead of the array itself, which could affect the behavior of the `matches` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.path === path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of rules that match the `path` instead of the entire `rules` array, which could affect the behavior of the `matches` method.

DONE.
