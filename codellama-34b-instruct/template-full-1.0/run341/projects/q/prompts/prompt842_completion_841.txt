  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment is a method call that returns a promise for the resolution of the given object after the specified milliseconds timeout, while the original code fragment is a method call that returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise at the end of a chain of promises, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment is a method call that returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise after the specified milliseconds delay, while the original code fragment is a method call that returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise at the end of a chain of promises, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment is a function that creates a new promise for which the resolve and reject
