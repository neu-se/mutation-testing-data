  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not equal to `null`, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` even if `value` is `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not equal to `null`, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` even if `value` is `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is not equal to `null`, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` even if `value` is `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
