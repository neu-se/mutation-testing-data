  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.ops` array is not guaranteed to be sorted, so the `OpIterator` constructor may not iterate over the ops in the correct order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `OpIterator` constructor may iterate over the ops in the wrong order, resulting in incorrect behavior when the `transformPosition` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `OpIterator` constructor may iterate over the ops in the wrong order, resulting in incorrect behavior when the `transformPosition` method is called.

DONE.
