  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` would be called even if `fapply` failed, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would be called even if `fapply` succeeded, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).not
```
This would result in different behavior because `not` would be called even if `fapply` succeeded, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
