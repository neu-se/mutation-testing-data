  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `trim` method to remove any whitespace from the beginning and end of the text, while the new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().split(" ").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `trim` method to remove any whitespace from the beginning and end of the text, while the new code fragment uses the `split` and `join` methods to remove any whitespace from the text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().replace(/\s+/g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `trim` method to remove any whitespace from the beginning and end of the text, while the new code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove any whitespace from the text.

DONE.
