  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if an exception was thrown, regardless of the value of `newValue`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!newValue
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `newValue` is truthy, regardless of whether an exception was thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw && !newValue
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if an exception was thrown and `newValue` is falsy.

DONE.
