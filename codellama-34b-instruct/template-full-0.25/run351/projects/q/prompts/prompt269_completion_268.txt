  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a function that fulfills a promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a function that notifies a promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise.

DONE.
