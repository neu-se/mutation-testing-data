  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment passes `null` instead. This could cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the `data` argument being present.

DONE.
