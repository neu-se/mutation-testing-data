Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathToFilename(path), 'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would open the file in write mode instead of read mode, potentially causing data loss or corruption if the file already exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathToFilename(path), 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would open the file in append mode instead of read mode, potentially causing unexpected behavior if the file is not intended to be appended to.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathToFilename(path), 'r+'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would open the file in read and write mode instead of just read mode, potentially allowing the file to be modified unexpectedly if the code does not intend to write to it.

DONE.
