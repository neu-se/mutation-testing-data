Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/die$/, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly pluralizes "die" to "dies" instead of the correct "dice", which would lead to incorrect pluralization for that specific word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/die$/, 'dices')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return "dices" as the plural form of "die", which is incorrect; the correct plural is "dice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/die$/, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly apply the rule for words ending in "y", resulting in "die" being pluralized to "dies" instead of the correct "dice".

DONE.
