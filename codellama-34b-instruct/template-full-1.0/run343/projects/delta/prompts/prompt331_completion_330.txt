  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = <nil>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp` variable would be `nil`, and would not have any attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = new Op();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp` variable would be an empty `Op` object, and would not have any attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = new Op({
    insert: 'hello',
    attributes: { bold: true },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp` variable would have the `insert` and `attributes` properties set, which would affect how the `invert` method works.

DONE.
