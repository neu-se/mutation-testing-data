  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first part of the first line of the stack trace, which is the function name, instead of the entire first line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLine.split(":")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second part of the first line of the stack trace, which is the line number, instead of the entire first line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLine.split(":")[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third part of the first line of the stack trace, which is the column number, instead of the entire first line.

DONE.
