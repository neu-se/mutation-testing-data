  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` operator is a boolean inverter, which means it takes a boolean value as input and produces the opposite boolean value as output. In this case, it will invert the result of `isNaN`, so if the original code returns `true`, the mutated code will return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `isNaN` function with no arguments, which would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value is finite, which is the opposite of the original code that checks if the value is not a number.

DONE.
