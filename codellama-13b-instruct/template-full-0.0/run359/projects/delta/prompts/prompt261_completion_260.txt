  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.compose
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` method is used to combine two `AttributeMap` objects, whereas the original code fragment uses the `diff` method to compare two `AttributeMap` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is used to invert an `AttributeMap` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `diff` method to compare two `AttributeMap` objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.merge
```
This would result in different behavior because the `merge` method is used to merge two `AttributeMap` objects, whereas the original code fragment uses the `diff` method to compare two `AttributeMap` objects.

DONE.
