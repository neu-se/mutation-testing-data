  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of `end`, potentially causing the function to skip over the `nextChunk()` call when it should be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would cause the `nextStream()` function to be called repeatedly, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value would cause the `nextChunk()` function to be called repeatedly, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
