 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consider the absolute value of `b` as 0, affecting the calculation of the hypotenuse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a random value for the absolute value of `b`, affecting the calculation of the hypotenuse and potentially causing unpredictable results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the absolute value of `a` for both `a` and `b`, affecting the calculation of the hypotenuse and potentially causing incorrect results when `b` has a different absolute value than `a`.

DONE.
