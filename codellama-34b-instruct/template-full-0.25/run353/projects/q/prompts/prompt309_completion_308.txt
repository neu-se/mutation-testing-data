  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `reject` function, which would reject the promise with the given reason, while the new code fragment would throw an error with the message "rejected".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `reject` function, which would reject the promise with the given reason, while the new code fragment would resolve the promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `reject` function, which would reject the promise with the given reason, while the new code fragment would reject the promise with a new error object with the message "rejected".

DONE.
