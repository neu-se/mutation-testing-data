  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the `prop` variable, which is assumed to be a function in the original code. The `map` function would still work, but it would return a different function, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that uses the `map` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access the `foo` property of the `prop` variable, which is assumed to be a function in the original code. This would throw an error if the `prop` function does not have a `foo` property, or if the `foo` property is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to add 1 to the `prop` variable, which is assumed to be a function in the original code. This would throw an error if the `prop
