  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra slash would cause the regular expression to match a different pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause it to match all occurrences of the pattern, rather than just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause it to match the pattern in a case-insensitive manner, which could result in different matches than the original code.

DONE.
