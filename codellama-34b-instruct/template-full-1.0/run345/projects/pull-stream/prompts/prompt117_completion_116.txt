  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would pass even if the length of `arguments` is less than 2, not just equal to 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would pass even if the length of `arguments` is greater than 2, not just equal to 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would pass even if the length of `arguments` is 0, not just equal to 2.

DONE.
