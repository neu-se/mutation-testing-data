  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a null value instead of a URL string, which would cause the rest of the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a URL string that is not related to the original URL, which would cause the rest of the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a URL string that is different from the original URL, which would cause the rest of the code to behave differently.

DONE.
