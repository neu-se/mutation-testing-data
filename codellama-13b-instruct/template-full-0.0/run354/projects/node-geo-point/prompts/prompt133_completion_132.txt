  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.round` function rounds the input to the nearest integer, whereas `parseFloat` returns the input as a floating-point number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.prototype.toFixed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.prototype.toFixed` function returns a string representation of the input number with a fixed number of decimal places, whereas `parseFloat` returns the input as a floating-point number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.prototype.toPrecision
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.prototype.toPrecision` function returns a string representation of the input number with a specified number of significant digits, whereas `parseFloat` returns the input as a floating-point number.

DONE.
