  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire retain operation, rather than just the retain part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = otherOp.retain.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain only the length of the retain operation, rather than the entire operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = otherOp.retain.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain only the length of the retain operation, rather than the entire operation.

DONE.
