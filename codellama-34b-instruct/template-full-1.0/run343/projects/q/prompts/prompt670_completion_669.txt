  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been reversed, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive them in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args.slice(0), void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would create a shallow copy of the `args` array, which could cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be used as the first argument to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
