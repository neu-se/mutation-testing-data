  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360
```
This code fragment will generate a random number between 0 and 360, which can be used as the bearing in the `calculateDestination` method. This change will cause the method to return a different destination point than the original code, which may reveal bugs in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 180 - 90
```
This code fragment will generate a random number between -90 and 90, which can be used as the bearing in the `calculateDestination` method. This change will cause the method to return a different destination point than the original code, which may reveal bugs in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360 - 180
```
This code fragment will generate a random number between -180 and 180, which can be used as
