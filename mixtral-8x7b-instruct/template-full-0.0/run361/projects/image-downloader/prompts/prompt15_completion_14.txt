 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.win32.join
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Windows-style path join method, which may not work as expected on non-Windows systems.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(options.dest, decodedBasename) => path.join(options.dest, decodedBasename)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a function that returns the joined path instead of directly joining the paths. This could lead to unexpected results if the function is not called or called with incorrect arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `path.join` method with a simple string concatenation using the forward slash character. This could lead to incorrect paths if the code is executed on a system that uses a different path separator (e.g., Windows).

DONE.
