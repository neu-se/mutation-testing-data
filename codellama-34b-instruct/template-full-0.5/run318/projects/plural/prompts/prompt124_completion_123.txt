  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word as is, while this new code fragment returns the word in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + w.slice(1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word as is, while this new code fragment returns the word with the first letter capitalized and the rest of the word in lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.split('').reverse().join('') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word as is, while this new code fragment returns the word with its letters reversed.

DONE.
