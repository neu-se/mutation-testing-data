  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && abort
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called with a truthy value for `abort`, which will set `a` to `true` and call `onEnd` with `null`. This change will cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the `once` function being called with a falsy value for `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || abort
```
This change will cause the `once` function to be called with a truthy value for `abort` if `end` is truthy, which will set `a` to `true` and call `onEnd` with `null`. This change will cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the `once` function being called with a falsy value for `abort` when `end` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? abort : null
```
This change will cause the `once
