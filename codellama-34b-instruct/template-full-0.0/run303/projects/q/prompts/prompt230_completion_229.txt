  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operands` array is being accessed at a different index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && !operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operands` array is being accessed at the same index, but the value is being negated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[1] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `operands` array is being accessed at the same index, but the value is being checked for `undefined` instead of being used directly.

DONE.
