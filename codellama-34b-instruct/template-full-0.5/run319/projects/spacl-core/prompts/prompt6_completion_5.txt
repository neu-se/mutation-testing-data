  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\*//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of characters that starts with a slash, rather than just a single slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of characters that starts with a slash, but also allows for additional characters such as letters, numbers, and underscores.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:\/[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]+)+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of characters that starts with a slash, but also allows for additional characters such as letters, numbers, and underscores, and also allows for multiple segments separated by slashes.

DONE.
