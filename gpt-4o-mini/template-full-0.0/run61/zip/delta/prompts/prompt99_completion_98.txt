Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert `newOp` at the position `index + 1` instead of `index`, potentially skipping the last operation and altering the intended sequence of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the operation at `index` instead of replacing it, which could lead to loss of data or incorrect operation sequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1, 0, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to insert `newOp` at the position `index + 1` with a count of `0`, which is nonsensical and could lead to unexpected results or errors in the operation handling.

DONE.
