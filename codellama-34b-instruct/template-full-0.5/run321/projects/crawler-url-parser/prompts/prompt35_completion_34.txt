  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple string concatenation, while the new code fragment adds a new string "foo" to the end of the URL. This would change the resulting URL and potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple string concatenation, while the new code fragment reverses the order of the characters in the URL. This would change the resulting URL and potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple string concatenation, while the new code fragment replaces the "http" protocol with "https". This would change the resulting URL and potentially cause the code to behave differently,
