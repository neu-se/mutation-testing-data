  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.reverse()` would reverse the order of the verbs array, which could potentially cause the `allow` and `deny` methods to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `verbs` except the first one, which could potentially cause the `allow` and `deny` methods to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.pop()` would remove the last element from the `verbs` array, which could potentially cause the `allow` and `deny` methods to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
