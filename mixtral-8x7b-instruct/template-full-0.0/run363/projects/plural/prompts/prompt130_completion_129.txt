 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let i = -1; i < rules.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start with `i = -1`, which would cause the first rule to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start with `i` set to the length of the `rules` array, and would then decrement to `i = -1`, causing the loop to never execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i > rules.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition is `i > rules.length`, which is always false, causing the loop to never execute.

DONE.
