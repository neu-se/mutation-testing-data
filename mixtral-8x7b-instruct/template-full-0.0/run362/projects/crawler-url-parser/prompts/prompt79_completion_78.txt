 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'body a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all 'a' elements within the 'body' instead of just 'a' elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'a:first'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only select the first 'a' element instead of all 'a' elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'.a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all elements with the class 'a' instead of all 'a' elements.

DONE.
