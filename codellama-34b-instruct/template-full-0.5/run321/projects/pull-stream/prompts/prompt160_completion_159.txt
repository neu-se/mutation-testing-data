  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not equal to `null`, and if `value` is `undefined`, the `cb` function will be called with `undefined` as its argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, and if `value` is `0`, the `cb` function will be called with `0` as its argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a truthy value, and if `value` is `"hello"`, the `cb` function will be called with `"hello"` as its argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
