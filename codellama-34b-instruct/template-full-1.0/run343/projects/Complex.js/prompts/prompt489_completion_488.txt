  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the object property "value" is now false, which may cause unexpected behavior in code that relies on the original value being true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the object property "value" is now undefined, which may cause unexpected behavior in code that relies on the original value being defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the object property "value" is now 0, which may cause unexpected behavior in code that relies on the original value being non-zero.

DONE.
