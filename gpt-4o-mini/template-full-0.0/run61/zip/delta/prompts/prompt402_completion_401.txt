Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly evaluate to true when the embedType does match the key of otherData, leading to the handler not being called when it should be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(thisData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the embedType against the keys of thisData instead of otherData, potentially causing the handler to be invoked incorrectly or not at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false, preventing the handler from being called regardless of the actual embedType, thus breaking the intended transformation logic.

DONE.
