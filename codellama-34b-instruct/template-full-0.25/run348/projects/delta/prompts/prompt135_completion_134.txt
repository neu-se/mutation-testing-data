  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peek()` method to be called twice, which could potentially cause issues if the method has side effects or if it is not idempotent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peek()` method to be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peek()` method to be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the method to return a different value.

DONE.
