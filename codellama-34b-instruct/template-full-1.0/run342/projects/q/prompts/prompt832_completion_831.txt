  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would rejected instead of fulfilled which violates the semantics of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would fulfill with undefined instead of the original value which could break the behavior of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would fulfill with undefined instead of the original value which could break the behavior of the promise.

DONE.
