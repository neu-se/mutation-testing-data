  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the function "reject" is being called instead of "fail", which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than only when the function call fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the function "notify" is being called, which would cause the promise to be notified of its current state, rather than being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (exception) {
    deferred.reject(exception);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function is being created that rejects the promise with the provided exception, rather than simply calling the "reject" method.

DONE.
