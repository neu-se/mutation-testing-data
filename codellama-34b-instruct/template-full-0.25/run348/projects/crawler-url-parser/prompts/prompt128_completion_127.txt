  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `typeof` operator to check if `pageurl` is a string, while this new code fragment uses the `===` operator to check if `pageurl` is equal to the string "string".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if `pageurl` has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.indexOf("string") === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if `pageurl` contains the substring "string".

DONE.
