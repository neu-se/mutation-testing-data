  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called with two arguments instead of one, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is called with two arguments instead of one, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is called with two arguments instead of one, which would cause an error.

DONE.
