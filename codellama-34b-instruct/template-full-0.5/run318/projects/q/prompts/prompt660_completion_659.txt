  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would be called instead of `deferred.resolve`, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called instead of `deferred.resolve`, causing the promise to be notified instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be returned instead of the expected promise, causing the promise chain to fail.

DONE.
