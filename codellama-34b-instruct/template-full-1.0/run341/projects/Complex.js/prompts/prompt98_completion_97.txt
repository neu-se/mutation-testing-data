  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'g' || tokens[i + 1] === 'G'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now interpret the letter "g" or "G" as indicating the imaginary unit, whereas it should only interpret "i" or "I" as such.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'e' || tokens[i + 1] === 'E'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now interpret the letter "e" or "E" as indicating the imaginary unit, whereas it should only interpret "i" or "I" as such.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== 'i' || tokens[i + 1] !== 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now interpret any letter except "i" or "I" as indicating
