  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops.filter(op => op.retain !== 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out operations with a retain value of 0, while the new code fragment would filter out operations with a retain value that is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops.filter(op => op.retain !== undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out operations with a retain value of undefined, while the new code fragment would filter out operations with a retain value that is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops.filter(op => op.retain !== null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out operations with a retain value of null, while the new code fragment would filter out operations with a retain value that is not null.

DONE.
