  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Custom error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different error message than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not emit any error message, whereas the original code fragment would emit an error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', err, 'Custom error message'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error message with a custom message, whereas the original code fragment would emit an error message with a different message.

DONE.
