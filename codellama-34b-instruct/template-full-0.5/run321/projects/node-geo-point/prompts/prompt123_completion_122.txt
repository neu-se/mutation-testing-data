  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value of the point instead of the latitude value, which would lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude value of the point, which would lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the longitude value of the point by 2, which would lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
