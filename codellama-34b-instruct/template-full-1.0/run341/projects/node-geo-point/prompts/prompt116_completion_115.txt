  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
calculateDistance(distance, bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because calculateDistance() takes two arguments x and y, while calculateDestination() takes three arguments coordinate, distance, and bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
calculateBearing(distance, bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because calculateBearing() takes two arguments x and y, while calculateDestination() takes three arguments coordinate, distance, and bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
toTile(distance, bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because toTile() takes a coordinate and a zoom level, while calculateDestination() takes a distance and a bearing.

DONE.
