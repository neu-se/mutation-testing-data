  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `hostname` is a different property of the `URL` object than `host`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.split('.').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last part of the hostname, which may not be the same as the whole hostname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host !== 'localhost'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the hostname is not `localhost`, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
