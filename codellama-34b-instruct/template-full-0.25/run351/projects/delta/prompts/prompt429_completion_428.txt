  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the `hasNext()` method to return `false` even if there are still operations left in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property is used to keep track of the current position in the iterator, and incrementing it by 1 would cause the `hasNext()` method to return `false` even if there are still operations left in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` property is an array of operations, and its `length` property is used to determine the number of operations in the iterator. If the `length` property is used instead of `peekLength()`, the `
