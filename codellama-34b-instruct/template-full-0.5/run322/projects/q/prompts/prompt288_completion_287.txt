  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is called with a promise that is not the same as the one returned by `Q(value)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is not a function and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is called with a promise that is not the same as the one returned by `reject(reason)`.

DONE.
