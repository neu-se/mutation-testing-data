  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of merging the two arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of merging the two arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.filter(function(x) { return x !== undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array that contains only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of merging the two arrays.

DONE.
