  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `b`, which would result in the negative of the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `b`, which would result in the imaginary part of the complex number plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `b`, which would result in the imaginary part of the complex number multiplied by 2.

DONE.
