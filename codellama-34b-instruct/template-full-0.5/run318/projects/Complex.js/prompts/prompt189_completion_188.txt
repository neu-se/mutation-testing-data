  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to 0. This would cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if `a` plus 1 is equal to 0. This would cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if `a` times `b` is equal to 0. This would cause the code to take a different
