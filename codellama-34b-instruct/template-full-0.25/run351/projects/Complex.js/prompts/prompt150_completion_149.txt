  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `isInfinite` property of the `Complex` object to `true`, which would cause the `isInfinite` method to always return `true`, even if the `Complex` object is not actually infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = function() { return false; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a new `isInfinite` method on the `Complex` object that always returns `false`, even if the `Complex` object is actually infinite.

DONE.
