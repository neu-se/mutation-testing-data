  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method is expecting the `longitude` property to be present in the input object, but it would not be present if the placeholder is replaced with `'latitude'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method is expecting the `longitude` property to have a specific value, but it would have a different value if the placeholder is replaced with `'longitude' + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method is expecting the `longitude` property to be present in the input object, but it would not be present if the placeholder is replaced with `undefined`.

DONE.
