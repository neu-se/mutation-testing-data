  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty object, even if the `options` argument is not provided, which would cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options && options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the `deprecated` property is set to `true` in the `options` object, and would return `undefined` otherwise, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated || options.deprecated === 'true'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the `deprecated` property is set to `true` or the string `'true'` in the `options` object, and would return `undefined` otherwise,
