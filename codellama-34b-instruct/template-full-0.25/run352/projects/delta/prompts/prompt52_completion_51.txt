  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and the code would be comparing the wrong values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is not defined in the code, and the code would throw a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a different value than `b`, and the code would be comparing the wrong values.

DONE.
