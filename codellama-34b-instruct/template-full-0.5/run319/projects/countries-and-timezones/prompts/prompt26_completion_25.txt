  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `dstOffset` to be incremented by 1, which would change the resulting offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `dstOffset` to be doubled, which would change the resulting offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `dstOffset` to be decremented by 1, which would change the resulting offset string.

DONE.
