  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a tab character instead of a newline, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a carriage return character instead of a newline, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\b"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a backspace character instead of a newline, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
