  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `decodeURIComponent` function to decode the basename, while this replacement uses the `toUpperCase` method to convert the basename to uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(pathname).toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path.basename` function to get the basename, while this replacement uses the `toLowerCase` method to convert the basename to lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path.basename` function to get the basename, while this replacement uses the `path.dirname` function to get the directory name of the path.

DONE.
