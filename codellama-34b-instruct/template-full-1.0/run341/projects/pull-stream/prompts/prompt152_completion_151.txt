  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is not defined in the original code, so the mutated code would throw a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
foo
```
This would result in different behavior because there is no variable or function named `foo` in the original code, so the mutated code would throw a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbCb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbCb` function is not defined in the original code, so the mutated code would throw a reference error.

DONE.
