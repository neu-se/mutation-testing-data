  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `memoizeTimezone` is called with a non-null argument, which would update the `timezones` object. However, the new code fragment `memoizeTimezone(null)` would not update the `timezones` object, which could cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the `timezones` object being updated.
