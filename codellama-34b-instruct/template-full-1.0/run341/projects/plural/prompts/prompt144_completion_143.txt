  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the second element of the `rule` array, rather than checking if the first element matches the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the `rule` array, rather than checking if the word matches any of the elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, rather than checking if the word matches any of the elements.

DONE.
