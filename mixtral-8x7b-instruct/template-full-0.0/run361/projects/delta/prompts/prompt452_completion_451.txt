 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` checks if the current operation's length is greater than 0, while `hasNext` checks if the length of the next operation is less than infinity. This change would cause the iterator to return `false` when the current operation's length is exactly 0, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` checks if the index is less than the length of the `ops` array, while `peekLength` checks if the current operation exists. This change would cause the iterator to return `true` when the `index` is less than the length of the `ops` array, but the current operation is undefined, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
