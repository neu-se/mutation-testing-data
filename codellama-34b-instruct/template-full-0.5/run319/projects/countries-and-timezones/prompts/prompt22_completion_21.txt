  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be increased by 1 minute, which could change the resulting time string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be doubled, which could change the resulting time string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be halved, which could change the resulting time string.

DONE.
