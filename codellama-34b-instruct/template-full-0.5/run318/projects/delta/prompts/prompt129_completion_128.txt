  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different number of elements than the original code, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(start - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different number of elements than the original code, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - start)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different number of elements than the original code, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
