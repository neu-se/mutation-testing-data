  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value + 1; }
```
This change will cause the `thenResolve` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `thenResolve` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value - 1; }
```
This change will cause the `thenResolve` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `thenResolve` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value * 2; }
```
This change will cause the `thenResolve` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `thenResolve` method.

DONE.
