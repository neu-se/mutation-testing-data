  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method now returns a promise for `undefined`, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Oops!")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would now be rejected with an error message of "Oops!".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` method returns a promise for the return value of `callback`, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
