  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` is a function that returns the exponential of a number, whereas `Math.exp(-x)` is a function that returns the exponential of a negative number. This could cause issues if the input to the function is negative, as the result would be a complex number rather than a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is a function that returns the cosine of a number, whereas `Math.cosh` is a function that returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number. This could cause issues if the input to the function is negative, as the result would be a complex number rather than a real number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a function that returns the sine of a number, whereas `Math.sinh
