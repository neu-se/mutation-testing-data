Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow non-object types (like strings or numbers) to pass through, leading to potential runtime errors when trying to retain a non-object type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow undefined values for `a`, which should not be permitted, thus causing the function to fail silently or behave unexpectedly when it encounters an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow arrays to pass through, rejecting all other object types, which could lead to incorrect handling of valid operations that involve non-array objects.

DONE.
