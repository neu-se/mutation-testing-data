Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextOp` to be fetched with the remaining `firstLeft` value instead of the intended length, potentially leading to incorrect operations being composed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always fetch the next operation starting from index 0, ignoring the current position in the iterator, which could lead to incorrect composition of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always fetch the next operation with a length of 1, which may not correspond to the actual length of the operation being processed, leading to incorrect results in the composed delta.

DONE.
