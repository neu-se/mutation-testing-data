  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects a `this` argument to be passed in as the first argument, whereas `apply` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that has the `this` value bound to the first argument, whereas `apply` and `call` do not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects the `this` value to be passed in as the first argument, whereas `null` is being passed in.

DONE.
