  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because when `deprecated` is `true`, the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`, whereas the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because when `deprecated` is `false`, the original code fragment would evaluate to `true`, whereas the new code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because when `deprecated` is `true`, the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`, whereas the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
