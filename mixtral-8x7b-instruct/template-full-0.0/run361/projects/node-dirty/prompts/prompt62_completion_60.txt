 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check for the 'ENOENT' error code, and instead emit an error for any 'error' event on the read stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately destroy the read stream without waiting for any data to be read.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._readStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would destroy the read stream without checking for any errors first.

DONE.
