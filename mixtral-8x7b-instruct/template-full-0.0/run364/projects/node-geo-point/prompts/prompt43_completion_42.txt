 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.sin()` function on `point2.latitude` instead of the `point2Rad` variable, which could lead to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `point2Rad` value with a constant `0`, causing the distance calculation to always return `0`, regardless of the actual distance between the points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
acos(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `point2Rad` value with `acos(1)`, which is a constant `0`, causing the distance calculation to always return `0`, regardless of the actual distance between the points.

DONE.
