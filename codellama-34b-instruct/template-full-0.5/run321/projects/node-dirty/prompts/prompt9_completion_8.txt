  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `key` to `null` instead of `val`, which could cause issues if the code relies on the value being set to `val`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `key` to `undefined` instead of `val`, which could cause issues if the code relies on the value being set to `val`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `key` to `val + 1` instead of `val`, which could cause issues if the code relies on the value being set to `val`.

DONE.
