  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator will increment the value of `line` by 1, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip every other line in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator will decrement the value of `line` by 1, which would cause the `eachLine` method to only process every other line in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator will double the value of `line`, which would cause the `eachLine` method to process every line in the delta twice.

DONE.
