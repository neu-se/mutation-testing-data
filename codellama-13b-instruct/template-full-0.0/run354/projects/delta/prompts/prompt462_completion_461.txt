  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rest of the ops array starting from the next index, rather than the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rest of the ops array starting from the previous index, rather than the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rest of the ops array starting from the next index plus 2, rather than the current index.

DONE.
