  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "theses" and "crises" for the words "thesis" and "crisis", respectively, while the modified code fragment would return "thisis" and "crisis" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "theses" and "crises" for the words "thesis" and "crisis", respectively, while the modified code fragment would return "theseses" and "criseses" instead.
