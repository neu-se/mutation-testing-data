  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cloneDeep` function would return a new empty object, rather than a copy of the `newOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cloneDeep` function would return `null`, rather than a copy of the `newOp` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = { ...newOp };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cloneDeep` function would return a new object with the same properties as the `newOp` object, but with different references.

DONE.
