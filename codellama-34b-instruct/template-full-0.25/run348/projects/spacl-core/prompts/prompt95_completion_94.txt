  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would set the value of the `policy` key to `null`, instead of the `Policy` object. This would cause the `query` method to return `null` for any policy name, even if the policy exists in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would set the value of the `policy` key to the name of the policy, instead of the `Policy` object. This would cause the `query` method to return `null` for any policy name that does not match the name of the policy in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would set the value of the `policy` key to the name of the policy concatenated with the string 'foo', instead of the `Policy` object
