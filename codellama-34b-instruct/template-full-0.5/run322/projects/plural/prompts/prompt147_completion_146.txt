  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the first element of the rule array instead of the second element, which is the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the second element of the rule array plus one, which would result in an incorrect plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the first element of the rule array plus one, which would result in an incorrect plural form.

DONE.
