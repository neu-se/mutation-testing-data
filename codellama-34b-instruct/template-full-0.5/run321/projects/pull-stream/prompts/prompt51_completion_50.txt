  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!s
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `s`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `s` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `s`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `s` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would change the value of `s`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `s` is truthy.

DONE.
