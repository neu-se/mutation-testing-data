  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used as an index into the `arguments` array, and adding 1 to it would cause the code to access a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used as an index into the `arguments` array, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the code to access a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used as an index into the `arguments` array, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the code to access a different argument.

DONE.
