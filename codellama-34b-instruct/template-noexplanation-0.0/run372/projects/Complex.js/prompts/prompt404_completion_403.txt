  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re']
```
This change will cause the `atanh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] + 1
```
This change will cause the `atanh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] + x['im']
```
This change will cause the `atanh` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
