  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass a value to the callback function, while the changed code fragment `null` would pass a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass a value to the callback function, while the changed code fragment `undefined` would pass an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass a true value to the callback function, while the changed code fragment `cb(false)` would pass a false value.

DONE.
