  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise` is a promise object, while `defer` is a function that returns a promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise.then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise.then(function(value) { return value; })` is a promise object that resolves to the value returned by the `defer` function, while `defer` is a function that returns a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise.catch(function(error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise.catch(function(error) { throw error; })` is a promise object that rejects with the error thrown by the `defer` function, while `defer` is
