  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a legitimate value in JavaScript and using it as a callback function will trigger the script to attempt to call `undefined` as a function, which will result in a `TypeError` and cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is also a legitimate value in JavaScript and using it as a callback function will trigger the script to attempt to call `null` as a function, which will result in a `TypeError` and cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return {} }
```
This would result in different behavior because this function will return an object, which will not be equivalent to `undefined` or `null`, and will not cause the script to throw a `TypeError`.

DONE
