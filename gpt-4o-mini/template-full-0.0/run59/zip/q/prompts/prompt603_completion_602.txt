Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = Promise.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a resolved promise immediately, which means the `dispatch` function will execute synchronously instead of asynchronously, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = { promise: null, resolve: function() {} };
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a `deferred` object without a proper promise implementation, which would lead to `undefined` being returned when trying to access `deferred.promise`, breaking the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = { promise: new Promise(() => {}), resolve: function() {} };
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a promise that never resolves (due to the empty executor function), causing any subsequent operations that rely on the promise being settled to hang indefinitely.

DONE.
