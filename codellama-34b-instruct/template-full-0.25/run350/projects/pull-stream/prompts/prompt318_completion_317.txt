  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` if `test(data)` is `true`, but this new code fragment calls `cb` regardless of the result of `test(data)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the original `data` value to `cb`, but this new code fragment passes a modified `data` value (i.e., `data + 1`) to `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the original `data` value to `cb`, but this new code fragment passes a modified `data` value (i.e., `data * 2`) to `cb`.

DONE.
