  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = this.ops[this.index + 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.index + 1` would return a different op than `this.ops[this.index]`, which is the current op being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = this.ops[this.index - 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.index - 1` would return a different op than `this.ops[this.index]`, which is the current op being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp` would no longer be a valid op, and the code would throw an error when trying to access its properties.

DONE.
