  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, which is unlikely to be a valid argument for the `Math.sqrt` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(1)` is always 1, regardless of the value of the `b` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(-1)` is always `NaN`, regardless of the value of the `b` variable.

DONE.
