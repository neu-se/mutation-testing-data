  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing a comma between the two regular expressions, which would cause the second regular expression to be interpreted as a string literal instead of a regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
