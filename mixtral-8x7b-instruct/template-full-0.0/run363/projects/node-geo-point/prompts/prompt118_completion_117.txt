 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a distance of 0, regardless of the input points, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random distance value between 0 and 1, instead of calculating the actual distance between the two points, making the test suite ineffective in detecting incorrect distance calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
1000000
