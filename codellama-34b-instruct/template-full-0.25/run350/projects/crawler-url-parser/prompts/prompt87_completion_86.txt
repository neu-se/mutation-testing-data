  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `text()` method, which returns the text content of the element, while the new code uses the `text()` method with the `trim()` method, which removes whitespace from the beginning and end of the text content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `text()` method, which returns the text content of the element, while the new code uses the `text()` method with the `toLowerCase()` method, which converts the text content to lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().split(" ").join("");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `text()` method, which returns the text content of the element, while the new code uses the `text()` method with the `split()` and `join
