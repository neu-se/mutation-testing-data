  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `matches` method on the `policy` object with the `path` and `ctx` arguments, which would return a boolean value indicating whether the policy matches the given path. In the original code, the `matches` method is not called, so the behavior would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `matches` method on the `policy` object with only the `path` argument, which would return a boolean value indicating whether the policy matches the given path. In the original code, the `matches` method is called with both the `path` and `ctx` arguments, so the behavior would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `matches` method
