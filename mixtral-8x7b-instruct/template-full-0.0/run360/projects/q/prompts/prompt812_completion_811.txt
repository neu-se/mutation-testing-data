 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall()` method is removed, and the callback function would be directly called without being treated as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return callback; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the callback function itself instead of invoking it, so the promise would not proceed to its next state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `this` inside the callback function, potentially causing issues if the function relies on the correct context.

DONE.
