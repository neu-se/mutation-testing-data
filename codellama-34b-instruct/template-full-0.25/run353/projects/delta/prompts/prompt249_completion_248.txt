  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.retain == null) {
  newOp.insert = thisOp.insert;
} else {
  newOp.retain = thisOp.retain;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `thisOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement code does not perform that check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number') {
  newOp.retain = thisOp.retain;
} else {
  newOp.insert = thisOp.insert;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `thisOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement code does not perform that check.

if (thisOp.retain == null) {
