  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments that have different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called on the promise, and therefore the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called on the promise, and therefore the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('promise rejected')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called on the promise, and therefore the promise would not be resolved or rejected. Instead, an error would be thrown when the promise is created.
