  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^$.])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for "$" and ".", while the new code fragment matches any character except for "$".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for "$" and ".", while the new code fragment matches any character except for "$" and ".".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$]+)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for "$" and ".", while the new code fragment matches one or more characters except for "$" and ".".

DONE.
