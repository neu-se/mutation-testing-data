  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.re` is a property of the `Complex` object, but it is not being used as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.re
```
This would result in different behavior because `z` is a separate object from `this`, and `z.re` is not equivalent to `this.re`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is a mathematical expression, but it is not being used as a function.

DONE.
