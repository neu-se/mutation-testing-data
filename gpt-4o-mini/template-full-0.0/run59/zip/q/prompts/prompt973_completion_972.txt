Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.npost(object, name, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would recursively call the `npost` method instead of the intended method, potentially leading to an infinite loop or stack overflow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).ninvoke(name, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `ninvoke` method instead of `npost`, which may not be compatible with the expected behavior of invoking a method with a callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("invoke", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the action from "post" to "invoke", which may not be defined for the object, leading to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
