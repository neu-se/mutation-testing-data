Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!urlObj.hostname.includes('www.')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'www.' is not present anywhere in the hostname, rather than checking if the hostname starts with 'www.' followed by a valid domain name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.hostname === 'www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for an exact match with 'www.', rather than checking if the hostname starts with 'www.' followed by a valid domain name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.hostname.startsWith('example.')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the hostname starts with 'example.', rather than checking if it starts with 'www.' followed by a valid domain name, effectively removing a different subdomain.

DONE.
