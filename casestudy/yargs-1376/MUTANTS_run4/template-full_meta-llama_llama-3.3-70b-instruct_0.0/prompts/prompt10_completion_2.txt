Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.extends
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking if the 'extends' property of the 'extends' property exists, rather than checking if the 'extends' property of the config object exists, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the 'extends' property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defaultConfig
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking if the 'extends' property exists in the defaultConfig object, rather than the config object, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the 'extends' property and causing the function to not extend the config as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, as null does not have any properties, including 'extends', causing the function to never attempt to extend the config, even if it has an 'extends' property.

DONE.
