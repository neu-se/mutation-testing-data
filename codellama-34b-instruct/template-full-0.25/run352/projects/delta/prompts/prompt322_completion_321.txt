  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty slice, whereas the original code would return a slice with the first element of the base array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice with the second element of the base array, whereas the original code would return a slice with the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(-1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice with the last element of the base array, whereas the original code would return a slice with the first element.

DONE.
