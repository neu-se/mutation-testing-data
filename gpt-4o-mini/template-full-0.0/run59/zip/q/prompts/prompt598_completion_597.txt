Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation being dispatched to the first argument of the `args` array instead of the intended `op`, potentially leading to incorrect method calls or operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalidOperation"
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the dispatch to use a string that does not correspond to any valid operation, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior when trying to handle the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the operation would cause the dispatch function to attempt to execute a null operation, which is not valid and would likely lead to a runtime error or failure in the promise chain.

DONE.
