  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is used to explicitly set the `this` value of the function, whereas `apply` sets it implicitly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is used to pass arguments as a single array, whereas the above code passes each argument individually.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.bind(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value, whereas `apply` sets the `this` value of the function for a single call.

DONE.
