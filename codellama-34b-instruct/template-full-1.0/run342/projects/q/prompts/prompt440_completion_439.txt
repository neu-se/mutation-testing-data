  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length of the `unhandledRejections` array with the `promise` object, rather than checking for the presence of `promise` in the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.some(function(p) { return p === promise; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if any of the promises in the `unhandledRejections` array is the same as `promise`, rather than checking if `promise` is in the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value === reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the resolved value of `promise` is equal to `reason`, rather than checking if `promise`
