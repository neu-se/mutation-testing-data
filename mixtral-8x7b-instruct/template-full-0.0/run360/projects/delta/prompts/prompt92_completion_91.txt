 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow pushing the newOp even when the length of this.ops has been reached, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error when trying to access an index that is out of bounds, which would prevent the newOp from being pushed into the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow pushing the newOp if it is the last element in the array, which could cause unexpected behavior if the newOp should be inserted in a different position.

DONE.
