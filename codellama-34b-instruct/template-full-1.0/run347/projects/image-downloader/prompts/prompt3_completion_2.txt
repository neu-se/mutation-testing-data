  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.__filename is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of `__filename` property in the `options` object, which may not exist or have a different value than the expected `url`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is undefined')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of the `dest` property in the `options` object, which may not exist or have a different value than the expected `url`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('The options.url is invalid')
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error with a different message than the expected `Error('The options.url is required')`.

DONE.
