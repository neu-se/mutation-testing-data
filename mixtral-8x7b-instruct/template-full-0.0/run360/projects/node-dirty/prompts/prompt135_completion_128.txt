 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'(' + ({key, val: this._data.get(key)}) + ')'
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the object in parentheses instead of serializing it to a JSON string. The calling code expecting a JSON string would now receive an invalid object wrapped in parentheses.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.parse('{' + ({key, val: this._data.get(key)}) + '}')
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to parse the object as a JSON string, which would fail since it's not a valid JSON string. This would cause a runtime error in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.stringify(this._data.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it only serializes the value of the key instead of the entire object with the key and value. This would cause data loss
