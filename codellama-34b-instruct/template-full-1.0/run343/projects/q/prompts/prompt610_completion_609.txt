  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).progressDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressDispatch` is not a valid method of the `Q` object, and therefore this code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get")
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` expects an array of arguments, and this code only provides one string argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key, 10])
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` expects an array of arguments, and this code provides an array with more than one element.
