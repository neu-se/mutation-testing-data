Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index of the substring extraction from the object type string, resulting in an incorrect type name being returned (e.g., "Object" instead of "[object Object]").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it shifts the starting index of the substring extraction by one character, causing the returned type name to be missing the first character (e.g., "bject" instead of "[object Object]").

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the ending index of the substring extraction, which would lead to an incorrect type name being returned (e.g., "[object O" instead of "[object Object]").

DONE.
