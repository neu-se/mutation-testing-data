  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.message` is a string representation of the error, while `e` is the error object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack` is a string representation of the error's stack trace, while `e` is the error object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.toString()` is a string representation of the error, while `e` is the error object itself.

DONE.
