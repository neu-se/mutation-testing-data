  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the `err` variable, which could cause the `map` function to be called with a non-error value, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression if the first operand is falsy, which could cause the `map` function to be called with a non-error value, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression if the first operand is truthy, which could cause the `map` function to be called with a non-error value, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
