  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the second argument passed to the function, instead of all the arguments except the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first argument passed to the function, instead of all the arguments except the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array, instead of all the arguments except the first.

DONE.
