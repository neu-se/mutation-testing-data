 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
timeout === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the absence of a timeout value as null instead of undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof timeout === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for the type of timeout being undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
timeout === Q.timeout.NONE
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the absence of a timeout value as a special constant `Q.timeout.NONE`, which might have different behavior in the rest of the code.

DONE.
