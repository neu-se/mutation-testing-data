  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `at` variable by 1, which could potentially result in an index out of bounds error if the `at` variable is 0 or negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `at` variable by 1, which could potentially result in an index out of bounds error if the `at` variable is greater than or equal to the length of the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `at` variable to 0, which would cause the `splice` method to remove the first element of the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than the element at the specified index.

DONE.
