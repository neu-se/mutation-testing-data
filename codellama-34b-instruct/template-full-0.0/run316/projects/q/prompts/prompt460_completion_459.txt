  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand, whereas the `!==` operator checks if the operands are not equal. In this case, if `at` is less than -1, the condition would be true, even if `at` is not equal to -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand, whereas the `!==` operator checks if the operands are not equal. In this case, if `at` is greater than -1, the condition would be true, even if `at` is not equal to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks if the operands are equal, whereas the `!
