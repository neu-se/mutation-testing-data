  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the complex number is infinite, rather than if it is not a number (NaN).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the complex number is finite, rather than if it is not a number (NaN).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the complex number is zero, rather than if it is not a number (NaN).

DONE.
