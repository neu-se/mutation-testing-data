  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could change the behavior of the `allSettled` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the elements from the specified start index to the end of the array, which could change the behavior of the `allSettled` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array with the elements from the specified array and the elements from the original array, which could change the behavior of the `allSettled` method.

DONE.
