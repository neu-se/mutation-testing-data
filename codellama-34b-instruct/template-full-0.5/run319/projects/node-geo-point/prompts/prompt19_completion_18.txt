  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for null values as well as objects, whereas this code fragment only checks for objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the 'latitude' and 'longitude' properties, whereas this code fragment checks for the presence of any property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude !== undefined && object.longitude !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the 'latitude' and 'longitude' properties, whereas this code fragment checks for the presence of any property.

DONE.
