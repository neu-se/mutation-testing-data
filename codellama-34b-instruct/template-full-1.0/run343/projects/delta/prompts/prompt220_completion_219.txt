  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for the presence of an insert operation, while this new code is checking for its absence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking the type of the retain operation, while this new code is checking for its nullity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for the presence of a delete operation, while this new code is checking for the nullity of either a delete or retain operation.

DONE.
