  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function would no longer be called, which means that the `unhandledRejection` event would not be emitted, and the `rejectionHandled` event would not be emitted either.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit = function (event, reason, promise) {
    if (event === "unhandledRejection") {
        return;
    }
    return this.emit(event, reason, promise);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function would only be called for the `unhandledRejection` event, and the `rejectionHandled` event would not be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit = function (event, reason, promise) {
    if (event === "rejectionHandled") {
        return;
