Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to only check if `a` is less than zero, which would incorrectly allow the calculation of `im` when `a` is negative, potentially leading to incorrect results for the square root of complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the block for `im` when `a` is exactly zero, which could lead to incorrect handling of cases where `a` is positive or negative, thus affecting the calculation of the square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `b` is greater than zero instead of checking `a`, which would lead to incorrect calculations for the imaginary part of the square root when `a` is negative or zero.

DONE.
