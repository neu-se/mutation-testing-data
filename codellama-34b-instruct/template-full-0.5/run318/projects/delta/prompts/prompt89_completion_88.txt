  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, whereas this new code checks if it is not null. If `newOp.attributes` is an object, the original code would execute the `if` block, but if it is not null, the new code would execute the `if` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(newOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, whereas this new code checks if it is not an array. If `newOp.attributes` is an object, the original code would execute the `if` block, but if it is an array, the new code would execute the `if` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
