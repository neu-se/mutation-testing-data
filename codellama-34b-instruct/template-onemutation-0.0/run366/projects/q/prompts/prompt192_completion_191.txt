  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to extract the file name and line number from the stack trace, while the new code fragment uses a simple string split operation, which may not work correctly if the stack trace has a different format.
