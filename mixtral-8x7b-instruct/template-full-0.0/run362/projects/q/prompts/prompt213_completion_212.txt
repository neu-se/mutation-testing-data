 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value && isPromiseAlike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a redundant `value &&` check, which would not affect the outcome when `value` is truthy but would cause the condition to always be falsy when `value` is falsy, unlike the original code which returns an already resolved promise in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `true` when `isPromiseAlike(value)` is falsy, unlike the original code which would return a rejected promise in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value) ? value : Q(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it unconditionally wraps `value` in a promise, even when it is already a promise, unlike the original code which only wraps `value`
