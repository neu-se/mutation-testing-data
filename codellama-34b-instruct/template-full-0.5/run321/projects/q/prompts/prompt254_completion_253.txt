  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `message` object directly, while this replacement code fragment is using the `length` property of the `message` object. This would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `message` object directly, while this replacement code fragment is using the first element of the `message` array. This would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `message` object directly, while this replacement code fragment is using a slice of the `message` array starting from
