  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `get` method to return the next key in the Map instead of the current key, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the string "key" to be concatenated with the number 1, resulting in the string "key1", which may not be a valid key in the Map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `null` instead of the current key, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
