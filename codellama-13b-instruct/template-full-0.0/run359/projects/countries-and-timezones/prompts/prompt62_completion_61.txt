  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the `id` variable would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the `id` variable would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the `id` variable would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country object.

DONE.
