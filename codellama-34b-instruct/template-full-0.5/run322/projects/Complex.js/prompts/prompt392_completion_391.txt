  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `b` directly, while the replaced code fragment uses `b + 1`, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `b` directly, while the replaced code fragment uses `b - 1`, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `b` directly, while the replaced code fragment uses `2 * b`, which is a different value.

DONE.
