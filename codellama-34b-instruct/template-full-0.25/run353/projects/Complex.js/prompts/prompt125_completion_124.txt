  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']() || a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` if `a` and `b` are equal, regardless of whether either `this` or `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']() || a === b || c === d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` if `a` and `b` are equal, or if `c` and `
