 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks if the length is greater than or equal to 1, which would allow the `concat` method to include an empty delta in some cases, whereas the original condition explicitly checks if the length is greater than 0, which would prevent an empty delta from being included.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 0 && other.ops[0] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks if the first element of the `other.ops` array is not `undefined`, which would prevent an empty delta from being included if the first element of the array is `undefined`, whereas the original condition only checks if the length is greater than 0, which would not account for this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length !== 0
