Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline && newEOFNewline
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both old and new strings have a newline at the end, instead of checking for the absence of a newline in either string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if there are no new lines before adds, without considering the presence or absence of newlines at the end of the old and new strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!oldEOFNewline && newEOFNewline
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the absence of a newline at the end of the old string and the presence of a newline at the end of the new string, which is a different condition than the original code.

DONE.
