Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip processing one additional element in the base slice, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations that rely on the exact number of elements being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always process the same element twice, which could lead to incorrect state changes in the `inverted` Delta, as it would not properly account for the intended operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly attempt to process a range that is larger than intended, potentially leading to out-of-bounds access or incorrect data being included in the `inverted` Delta.

DONE.
