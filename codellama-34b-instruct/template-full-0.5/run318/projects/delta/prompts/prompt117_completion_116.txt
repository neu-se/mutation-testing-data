  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the element has a delete property, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the element has a retain property, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the element has any attributes, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
