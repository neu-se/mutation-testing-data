 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of `atan2` would always be a positive value, which would affect the calculation of the `λ2` variable and thus the resulting longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of `atan2` would always be a negative value, which would affect the calculation of the `λ2` variable and thus the resulting longitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of `atan2` would be randomly affected, which would affect the calculation of the `λ2` variable and thus the resulting longitude.

DONE.
