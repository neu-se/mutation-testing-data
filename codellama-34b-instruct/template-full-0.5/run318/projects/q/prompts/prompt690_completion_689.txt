  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the function call from `undefined` to the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument in the `arguments` object, which could cause issues if the function relies on that argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments in the `arguments` object, which could cause issues if the function relies on those arguments.

DONE.
