  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

plus + minus === 1

This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `plus + minus` is 0, which means that there is no sign (+ or -) before the number, while the new code checks if `plus + minus` is 1, which means that there is a sign (+ or -) before the number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus - minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `plus + minus` is 0, which means that there is no sign (+ or -) before the number, while the new code checks if `plus - minus` is 0, which means that there is a sign (-) before the number.
