  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(`${newOp.insert}`);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the `newOp.insert` string directly into the ops array, instead of creating a new object with the `newOp.insert` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push({ delete: newOp.delete + 1 });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one more character than the original code, which would affect the length of the resulting delta object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push({ insert: newOp.insert, delete: newOp.delete });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert and delete the same character, instead of just inserting a new character.

DONE.
