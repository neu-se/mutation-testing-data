 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.SQRT2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `floor` and `ceil` functions would now be operating with a different base (the square root of 2 instead of 10), which would change their rounding behavior for most inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `floor` and `ceil` functions would now be using the real part of the complex number as the base, rather than a constant. This would cause the functions to behave differently depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `floor` and `ceil` functions would now be rounding towards negative infinity instead of zero. This would cause the functions to behave differently for positive inputs.

DONE.
