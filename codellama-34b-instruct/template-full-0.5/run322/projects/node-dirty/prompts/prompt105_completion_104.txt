  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is undefined, whereas `row.key` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + "suffix"
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key + "suffix"` is a string concatenation, whereas `row.key` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key.toUpperCase()` is a string transformation, whereas `row.key` is a string.

DONE.
