  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.readdir
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.readdir` returns an array of filenames in the directory, while `fs.promises.access` checks if the file exists and can be accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.writeFile` writes a file to disk, while `fs.promises.access` checks if the file exists and can be accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.stat
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.stat` returns information about a file, while `fs.promises.access` checks if the file exists and can be accessed.

DONE.
