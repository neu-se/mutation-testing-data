  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation to the `ops` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `slice` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the `ops` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `slice` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a null value to the `ops` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `slice` method.

DONE.
