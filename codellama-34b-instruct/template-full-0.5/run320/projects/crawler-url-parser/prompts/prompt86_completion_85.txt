  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not trimming the text before returning it, while this modified code fragment trims the text before returning it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not converting the text to lowercase before returning it, while this modified code fragment converts the text to lowercase before returning it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().split(" ").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not removing spaces from the text before returning it, while this modified code fragment removes spaces from the text before returning it.

DONE.
