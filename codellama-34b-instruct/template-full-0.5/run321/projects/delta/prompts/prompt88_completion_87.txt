  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are strings, while this new code checks if they are both numbers. This could cause the program to behave differently in cases where the values are not strings or numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'boolean' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'boolean'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are strings, while this new code checks if they are both booleans. This could cause the program to behave differently in cases where the values are not strings or booleans.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'object' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'object'
