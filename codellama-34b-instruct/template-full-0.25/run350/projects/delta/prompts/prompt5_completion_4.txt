  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keepNull` variable is not defined in the code, so it would be treated as `undefined`, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if the `keepNull` variable is set to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used to negate the value of the `keepNull` variable, so if it is set to `false`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, and if it is set to `true`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used to check if the `keepNull` variable is strictly equal to `false`, so if it is set to `false`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `
