  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.im !== 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would return `false` when `im` is not equal to 0, which is the opposite of the original logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.re !== 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would return `false` when `re` is not equal to 0, which is the opposite of the original logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.isNaN() || this.isFinite())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would return `false` when the number is not a number or is finite, which is the opposite of the original logic.

DONE.
