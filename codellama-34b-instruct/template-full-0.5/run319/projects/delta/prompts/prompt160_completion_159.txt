  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(length));
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(length)` would return the next `length` elements from the `other` iterator, whereas `delta.push(otherIter.next(length))` would push those elements onto the `delta` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(delta.ops[length]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.ops[length]` would return the `length`th element from the `delta` array, whereas `delta.push(delta.ops[length])` would push that element onto the `delta` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(other.ops[length]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.ops[length]` would return the `length`th element from the `other` array, whereas `delta.push(other.ops[length])` would push
