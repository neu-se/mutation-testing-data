  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        gzip: false,
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `gzip` option with a level of compression, while the new code does not use `gzip` at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        gzip: true,
        gzipOptions: {
            level: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium,
        },
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `gzip` option with a level of compression, while the new code uses a different level of compression.
