  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because `values` is not a valid property of the `Promise.prototype` object, and would cause the `Promise.prototype.keys` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is not a method of the `Promise.prototype` object, and would cause the `Promise.prototype.keys` method to return a promise that resolves to the length of the `Promise.prototype` object, rather than the keys of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"toString"
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` is a method of the `Promise.prototype` object, and would cause the `Promise.prototype.keys` method to return a promise that resolves to the string representation of the `Promise.prototype` object, rather than the keys of the object.
