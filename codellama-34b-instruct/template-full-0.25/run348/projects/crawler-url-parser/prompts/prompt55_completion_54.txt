  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the third argument to `URL.parse()` would cause the function to not parse the query string, which could result in the `search` property of the returned URL object being different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the second argument to `URL.parse()` would cause the function to not parse the protocol, which could result in the `protocol` property of the returned URL object being different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value passed as the third argument to `URL.parse()` would cause the function to parse the query string and protocol, which could
