  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces it with a space. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces it with a question mark. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces it with a string that contains a space. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, leading to different results.
