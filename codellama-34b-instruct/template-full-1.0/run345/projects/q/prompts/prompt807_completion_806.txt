  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doesNotExist
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method being called on the promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notDefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method being called on the promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise object to be null, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
