  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `Q.async` function. This would cause the code to behave differently, as the function call would execute the function, while the reference would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a function call with an empty argument list. This would cause the code to behave differently, as the original code fragment would pass the arguments to the `Q.async` function, while the buggy code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a function call with an empty function body. This would cause the code to behave differently,
