  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `array`, whereas `array` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.concat()` creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `array` and any additional arrays passed as arguments, whereas `array` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.map(function(x) { return x; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.map()` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the `array`, whereas `array` itself is a reference to the original array.

DONE.
