  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort, true
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument has been added to the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the additional argument has been changed.

DONE.
