  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the unhandled rejections array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly set the length of the unhandled rejections array to 0, without calling the `resetUnhandledRejections` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable to false, which would cause the `trackRejection` function to not work as intended.

DONE.
