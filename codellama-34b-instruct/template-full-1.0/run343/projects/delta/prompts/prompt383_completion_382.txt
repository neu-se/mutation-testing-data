  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min` returns the smallest number among its arguments, while `Math.max` returns the largest number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), while `Math.min` and `Math.max` return the minimum and maximum numbers in a set of arguments, respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min(0, ...)` always returns 0, while `Math.min(Math.min, ...)` may return the minimum value of the arguments.

DONE.
