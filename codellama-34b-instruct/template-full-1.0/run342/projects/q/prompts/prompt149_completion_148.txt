  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of an array, while `Array.prototype.push()` adds an element to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.pop()` removes and returns the last element of an array, while `Array.prototype.unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.shift()` removes and returns the first element of an array, while `Array.prototype.unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

DONE.
