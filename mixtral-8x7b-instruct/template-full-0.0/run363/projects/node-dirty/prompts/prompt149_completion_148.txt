 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb = cbs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only assigns the first callback in the `cbs` array to `cb`, ignoring the rest of the elements in the array. The original code fragment uses `of` to iterate over all elements in the `cbs` array and assign each one to `cb` in turn.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = cbs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes and returns the last element of the `cbs` array, rather than iterating over all elements in the array. This could cause issues if there are multiple callbacks in the array that need to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = cbs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes and returns the first element of the `cbs` array, rather than iterating over all elements in the array.
