  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` returns the arccosine of a number, whereas `Math.atan2` returns the arctangent of two numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number, whereas `Math.atan2` returns the arctangent of two numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number, whereas `Math.atan2` returns the arctangent of two numbers.

DONE.
