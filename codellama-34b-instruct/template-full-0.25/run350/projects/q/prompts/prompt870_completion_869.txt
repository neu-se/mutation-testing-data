  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise if the `nfapply` method fails, while this modified code fragment also rejects the promise if the `fail` method fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only resolves the promise if the `nfapply` method succeeds, while this modified code fragment also resolves the promise if the `then` method succeeds.
