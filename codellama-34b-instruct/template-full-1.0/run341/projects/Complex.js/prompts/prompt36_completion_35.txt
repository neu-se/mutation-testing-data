  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log2` returns the base-2 logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm. In this case, the calculation of the logarithm is used to compute the square root of a complex number, so the use of `Math.log2` would give an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, whereas `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm. In this case, the calculation of the logarithm is used to compute the square root of a complex number, so the use of `Math.cosh` would give an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the exponential function of a
