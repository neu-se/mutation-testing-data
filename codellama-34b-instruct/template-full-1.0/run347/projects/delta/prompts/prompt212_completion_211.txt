  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the `ops` array is always non-negative, so the conditional statement would never be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement would be false when `other.ops.length` is 0, even though `delta` has some contents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement would be false when `other.ops.length` is 1, even though `delta` has some contents.

DONE.
