  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of `args`, which may cause issues if the function expects a specific length or structure for the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array that is the concatenation of `args` and any additional arguments passed to the function, which may cause issues if the function expects a specific length or structure for the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map()` creates a new array where each element is the result of applying the provided function to the corresponding element of `args`, which may cause issues if the function expects a specific structure or values for the `args` array
