 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > max + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated condition would cause the function to return `cb(<PLACEHOLDER>)` earlier, when `i` is equal to `max + 1`, whereas the original condition returns it when `i` is equal to `max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
