  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack string into an array of individual characters, rather than an array of lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(" ").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack string into an array of words, and then join them back into a single string with no spaces, rather than an array of lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack string into an array of lines, but it would include the newline characters in the resulting array, rather than splitting on the newline characters.

DONE.
