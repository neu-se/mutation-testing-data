 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback would receive `undefined` instead of the expected value when `end` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback would receive `0` instead of the expected value when `end` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
