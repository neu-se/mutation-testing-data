 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function will always return an empty array instead of the correct arguments slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function will throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `array_slice` with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function will include the current context (`this`) in the arguments slice, which is not expected by the original code.

DONE.
