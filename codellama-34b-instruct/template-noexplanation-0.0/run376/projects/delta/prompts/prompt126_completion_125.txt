  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= start
```
This change will cause the loop to continue one iteration longer, potentially resulting in an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > start
```
This change will cause the loop to skip the first iteration, potentially resulting in a missed iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= start
```
This change will cause the loop to continue one iteration longer, potentially resulting in an out-of-bounds error.

DONE.
