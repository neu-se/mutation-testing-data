  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|12345'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional characters `12345` would be included in the generated plural form of the input word, which would not be the case with the original `|` character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string would be used as the separator between the elements in the generated plural form of the input word, which would not be the case with the original `|` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of the input word would be generated without any separator between the elements, which would not be the case with the original `|` character.

DONE.
