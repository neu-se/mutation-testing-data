  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the object, potentially causing the `isFulfilled` function to return `true` when it should return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method would return the primitive value of the object, potentially causing the `isFulfilled` function to return `true` when it should return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method would return the string representation of the object, potentially causing the `isFulfilled` function to return `true` when it should return `false`.

DONE.
