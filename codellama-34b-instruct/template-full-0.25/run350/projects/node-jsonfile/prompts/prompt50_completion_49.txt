  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not being used in the original code fragment, and using it would cause the `writeFileSync` function to write the file with a different encoding than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.flag
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flag` property is not being used in the original code fragment, and using it would cause the `writeFileSync` function to write the file with a different flag than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.mode
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` property is not being used in the original code fragment, and using it would cause the `writeFileSync` function to write the file with a different mode than the original code.

DONE.
