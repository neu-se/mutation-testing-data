  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(promise, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track the rejection of the promise with the given reason, while the original code fragment did not have any effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would stop tracking the rejection of the promise, while the original code fragment did not have any effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, promise), 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the promise from the list of reported unhandled rejections, while the original code fragment did not have any effect.

DONE.
