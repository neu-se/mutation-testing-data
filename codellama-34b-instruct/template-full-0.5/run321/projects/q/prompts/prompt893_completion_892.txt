  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is expected to be called with a `this` context of `null`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is expected to be called with a `this` context of `undefined`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is expected to be called with a `this` context of an empty object, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
