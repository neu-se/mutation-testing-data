  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is a function before calling it, while this new code fragment unconditionally calls `cb` with `null` as an argument. If `cb` is not a function, the original code fragment would not throw an error, while this new code fragment would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is a function before calling it, while this new code fragment unconditionally calls `cb` with `undefined` as an argument. If `cb` is not a function, the original code fragment would not throw an error, while this new code fragment would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(new Error('Something went wrong'));
```
This would result in different
