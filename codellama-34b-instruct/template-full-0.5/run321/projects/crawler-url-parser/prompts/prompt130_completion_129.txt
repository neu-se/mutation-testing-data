  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.replace("://", "::")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace only the first occurrence of the search string, whereas the original code fragment would replace all occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.replace(/:\/\//g, "::")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/:\/\//g` would match all occurrences of the search string, whereas the original code fragment would only match the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.replace(/:\/\//, "::")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/:\/\//` would match only the first occurrence of the search string, whereas the original code fragment would match all occurrences.

DONE.
