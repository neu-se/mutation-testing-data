Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` creates a new array by applying a function to each element, rather than accumulating a single value like `reduce` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((length, elem) => length + 1, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because this code counts the number of elements in `this.ops` instead of calculating a cumulative length based on the properties of each `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((length, elem) => length * 2, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because this code multiplies the accumulated length by 2 for each element, which does not reflect the intended calculation of the total length based on the `Op` objects.

DONE.
