  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `end.tail` to a reference to `end`, creating a circular reference. However, the new code fragment sets `end.tail` to `null`, breaking the circular reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = end;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `end.tail` to a reference to `end`, creating a circular reference. However, the new code fragment sets `end.tail` to `end`, creating a self-referential loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `end.tail` to a reference to `end`, creating a circular reference. However, the new code fragment sets `end.tail` to an empty object, breaking the circular reference.

DONE.
