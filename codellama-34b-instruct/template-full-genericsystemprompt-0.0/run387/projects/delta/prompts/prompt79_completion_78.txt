  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && newOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the last operation is a retain operation and the new operation is an insert operation, rather than checking if the last operation is a delete operation and the new operation is an insert operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.retain != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the last operation is a delete operation and the new operation is a retain operation, rather than checking if the last operation is a delete operation and the new operation is an insert operation.
