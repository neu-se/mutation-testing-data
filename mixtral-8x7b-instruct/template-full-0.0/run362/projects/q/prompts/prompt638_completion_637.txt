 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method is expecting the `key` argument, but it would now receive the `Promise` object (`this`), causing the method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method is expecting the `key` argument, but it would now receive `null`, causing the method to throw an error and behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method is expecting the `key` argument, but it would now receive an empty array (`[]`), causing the method to throw an error and behave unexpectedly.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing aims to reveal potential weaknesses in the test suite, giving developers a starting point for improving their tests. DONE.
