  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `stream` variable is a function, rather than an object. This could cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with a function as the `stream` argument, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream && 'function' === typeof stream.read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `stream` variable is an object with a `read` method, rather than just an object. This could cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with an object that does not have a `read` method, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream && 'function' === typeof stream.read && stream.read.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if
