  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is used to accumulate the reduced value, while `null` would reset the accumulator to `null` on each iteration, effectively ignoring the previous reduction result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is used to accumulate the reduced value, while `undefined` would reset the accumulator to `undefined` on each iteration, effectively ignoring the previous reduction result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is used to accumulate the reduced value, while `0` would reset the accumulator to `0` on each iteration, effectively ignoring the previous reduction result.

DONE.
