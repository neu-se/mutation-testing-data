  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when the `parser_exit` function is called, which would prevent the code from executing further.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new SyntaxError('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a `SyntaxError` when the `parser_exit` function is called, which would prevent the code from executing further.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new TypeError('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a `TypeError` when the `parser_exit` function is called, which would prevent the code from executing further.

DONE.
