  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = task;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the task to the head of the linked list, rather than the tail, which is the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tail.task = task;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the task to the tail of the linked list, rather than the head, which is the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.next = task;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the task to the next node in the linked list, rather than the head or tail, which is the original behavior.

DONE.
