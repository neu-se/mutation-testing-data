  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of a key in the `thisOp` object, while this new code checks for a specific value of the `retain` key to be a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of a key in the `thisOp` object, while this new code checks for a specific value of the `retain` key to be an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of a key in the `thisOp` object, while this new code checks for the presence of any key in the `thisOp` object.

DONE.
