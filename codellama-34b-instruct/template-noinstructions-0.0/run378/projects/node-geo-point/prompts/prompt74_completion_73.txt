  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg
```
This would result in different behavior because `rad2deg` is the inverse of `deg2rad`, so it would convert radians to degrees instead of degrees to radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the input value before converting it to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the input value before converting it to radians.

DONE.
