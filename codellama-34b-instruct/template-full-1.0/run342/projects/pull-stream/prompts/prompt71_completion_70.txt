  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is being incremented by 1 instead of being evaluated directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is being decremented by 1 instead of being evaluated directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is being negated instead of being evaluated directly.

DONE.
