  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to be called with the arguments `linkurl` and `pageurl`, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, linkurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to be called with the arguments `linkurl` and `linkurl`, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.
