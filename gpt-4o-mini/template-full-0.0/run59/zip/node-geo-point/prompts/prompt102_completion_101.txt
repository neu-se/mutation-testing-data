Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg + 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 90 degrees to the calculated longitude, effectively shifting the destination point eastward by 90 degrees, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the result of the `rad2deg` function, which would incorrectly scale the latitude and longitude, leading to an inaccurate destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 180 degrees from the calculated longitude, which could lead to an incorrect normalization of the longitude value, potentially placing the destination point in the opposite hemisphere.

DONE.
