  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method returns the length of the op, while `0` would always return 0, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method returns the length of the op, while `null` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` if it is used as a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method returns the length of the op, while `undefined` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` if it is used as a number.

DONE.
