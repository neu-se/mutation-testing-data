  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!timezone` checks if the `timezone` variable is falsy, while the new code fragment `timezone.name` checks if the `name` property of the `timezone` object is falsy.

DONE.
