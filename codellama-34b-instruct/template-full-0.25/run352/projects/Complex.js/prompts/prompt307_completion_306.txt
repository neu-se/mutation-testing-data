  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function, which has a different range and output than `cosh`, the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, which has a different range and output than `cosh`, the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `acosh` is the inverse hyperbolic cosine function, which has a different range and output than `cosh`, the hyperbolic cosine function.

DONE.
