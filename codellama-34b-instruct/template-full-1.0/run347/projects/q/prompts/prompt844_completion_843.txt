  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not an Error object, and it would not trigger the `onUnhandledError` function in the `done` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ERROR"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"ERROR"` is a string, and it would be passed to the `reject()` function in the `timeout` method, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Error object with the message "Error", and it would be passed to the `reject()` function in the `timeout` method, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately.

DONE.
