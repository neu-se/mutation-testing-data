  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isObject(object) && object.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object is not an object and if its type is not 'Point', which would cause the function to throw an error if the object is not a valid GeoJSON Point object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isObject(object) || object.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object is not an object or if its type is not 'Point', which would cause the function to throw an error if the object is not a valid GeoJSON Point object or if it is not of type 'Point'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isObject(object) && object.type !== 'Point' && object.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object is not an object, if its type is not 'Point
