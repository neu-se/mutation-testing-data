  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function to calculate the argument of a complex number, while this replacement uses the `*` operator to perform a multiplication.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function to calculate the argument of a complex number, while this replacement uses the `+` operator to perform an addition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.atan2` function to calculate the argument of a complex number, while this replacement uses the `-` operator to perform a subtraction.

DONE.
