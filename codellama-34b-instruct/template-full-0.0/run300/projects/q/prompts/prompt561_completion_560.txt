  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.value` is not defined in the original code, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, and would cause the `isStopIteration` function to always return `false`, even if the exception is a `StopIteration` exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.name` is a string, and would cause the `isStopIteration` function to always return `false`, even if the exception is a `StopIteration` exception.

DONE.
