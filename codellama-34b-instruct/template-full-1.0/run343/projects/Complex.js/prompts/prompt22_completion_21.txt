  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a + b, which adds the two values, while a * b multiplies them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a + b, which adds the two values, while a - b subtracts them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a + b, which adds the two values, while b - a subtracts them.

DONE.
