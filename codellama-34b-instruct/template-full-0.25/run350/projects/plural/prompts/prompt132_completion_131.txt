  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of a variable, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(word)` returns a string representation of the object, while `type` returns the type of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `word.constructor.name` returns the name of the constructor function that created the object, while `type` returns the type of the object.

DONE.
