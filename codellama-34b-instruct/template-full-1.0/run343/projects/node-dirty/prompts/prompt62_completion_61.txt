  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`undefined`
```
This would result in different behavior because the intention of the original code is to destroy the stream object, while `undefined` would not destroy it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`null`
```
This would result in different behavior because the intention of the original code is to destroy the stream object, while `null` would not destroy it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`this`
```
This would result in different behavior because the intention of the original code is to destroy the stream object, while `this` would not destroy it.

DONE.
