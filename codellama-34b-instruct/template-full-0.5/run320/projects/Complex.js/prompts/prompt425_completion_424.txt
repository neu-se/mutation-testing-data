  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, and would throw a `ReferenceError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, and would throw a `ReferenceError` when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, and would throw a `ReferenceError` when called.

DONE.
