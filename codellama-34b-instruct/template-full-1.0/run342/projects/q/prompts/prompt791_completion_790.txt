  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.rejected` is not a valid function, and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.rejected` is not a valid function, and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.rejected` is not a valid function, and would cause an error.

DONE.
