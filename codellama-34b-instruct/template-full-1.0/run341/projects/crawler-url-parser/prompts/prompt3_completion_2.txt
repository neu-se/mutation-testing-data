  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof currentUrlStr !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of the original code fragment would cause the function to return `null` when `currentUrlStr` is defined, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when `currentUrlStr` has a length of 0, but the original code fragment would return `null` only when the `currentUrlStr` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof currentUrlStr !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `currentUrlStr` is defined, but this new condition would check whether `currentUrlStr` is not a string, which could result in different behavior depending on how the function is used.

DONE.
