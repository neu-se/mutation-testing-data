  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toLowerCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word as it is, while this new code fragment returns the word in lowercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.split('').reverse().join('') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word as it is, while this new code fragment returns the word with its letters reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word as it is, while this new code fragment returns the word without its first letter.

DONE.
