  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the current iterator, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the maximum of the two lengths, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
