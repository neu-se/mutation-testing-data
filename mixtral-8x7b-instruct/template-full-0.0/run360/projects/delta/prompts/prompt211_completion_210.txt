 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `ops` array, so any changes made to the `delta` object won't affect the original `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.concat()
