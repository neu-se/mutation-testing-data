  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` without any arguments creates a new promise, while `defer(true)` creates a resolved promise. This could cause the `nfcall` function to behave differently if a resolved promise is returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` without any arguments creates a new promise, while `defer(false)` creates a rejected promise. This could cause the `nfcall` function to behave differently if a rejected promise is returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` without any arguments creates a new promise, while `defer(null)` sets the promise to `null`. This could cause the `nfcall` function to behave differently if a `null` promise is returned.

DONE.
