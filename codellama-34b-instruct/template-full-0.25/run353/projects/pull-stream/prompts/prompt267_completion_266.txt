  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` value, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `nextStream` function to be called, even if the `end` value is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if the `end` value is strictly equal to `true`, and not if it is simply truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if the `end` value is strictly equal to `false`, and not if it is simply falsy.

DONE.
