  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test(data)` is a different function than `test(data)`, and it may have a different implementation that could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && tester.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `tester.test(data)` check would cause the test to fail if `test(data)` is true but `tester.test(data)` is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || tester.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `tester.test(data)` check would cause the test to pass if `test(data)` is false but `tester.test(data)` is true.

DONE.
