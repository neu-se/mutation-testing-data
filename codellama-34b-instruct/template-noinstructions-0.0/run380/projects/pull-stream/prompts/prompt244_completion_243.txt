  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the function to return a new stream that is not the same as the original stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with `true` as the first argument, which would cause the function to return a new stream that is not the same as the original stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(false, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with `false` as the first argument, which would cause the function to return a new stream that is not the same as the original stream.

DONE.
