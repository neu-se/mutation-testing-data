  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid function, and calling it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid function, and calling it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function would not have any arguments, and thus could not call the `notify` method.

DONE.
