  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `cb` function, and it would cause an error when the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", and it would cause the `cb` function to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a string, and it would cause the `cb` function to return a different value than expected.

DONE.
