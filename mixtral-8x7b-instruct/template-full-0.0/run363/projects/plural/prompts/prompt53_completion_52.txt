 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['dwarf', 'roof'].includes(w)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Array.prototype.includes` method instead of the `strict equality` operator. This change would cause issues if the `w" variable is equal to a number or a boolean that has the same value as the string 'dwarf' or 'roof'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w in {dwarf: 1, roof: 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `in` operator to check for the presence of a property in an object. This change would cause issues if the `w` variable is equal to a string that has the same value as the property name, but is not strictly equal to the property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(window, w) && (w === 'dwarf' || w === 'roof
