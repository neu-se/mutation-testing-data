  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.isFulfilled(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.isFulfilled` would return a boolean value, but `thenReject` expects a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(undefined, reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` would always resolve with `undefined` instead of rejecting with the original reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(identity, reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` would always resolve with the original value instead of rejecting with the original reason.

DONE.
