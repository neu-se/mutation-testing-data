  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!countries[countryId]
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries` is an object, and `!country` would check if the variable `country` is null or undefined, while `!countries[countryId]` would check if the property with the key `countryId` in the object `countries` is null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `countryId` is a string, and `countryId === null` would check if the string is equal to the string "null", while `!country` would check if the variable `country` is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(countries, countryId)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(countries, countryId)` checks if the property with the key `countryId
