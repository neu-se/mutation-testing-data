 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.next.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will have its `this` keyword set to the provided value. This could cause issues if the code relies on the original `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(this.next as any)()
```
This would result in different behavior because casting `this.next` to `any` and immediately invoking it would bypass any potential type checking or method guards that might be in place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(this.next as Function).call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because explicitly setting the `this` context to `null` would cause the method to lose its original context, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

DONE.
