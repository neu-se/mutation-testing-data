Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the addition operator to a subtraction operator, which will yield a different result when calculating the logarithm, potentially leading to incorrect values or undefined results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the constant inside the square root from `1` to `-1`, which could lead to complex results when `a` is less than `1`, thus altering the expected output of the logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + Math.sqrt(b * b + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the variable `a` with `b`, which changes the input to the logarithm calculation from the real part of the complex number to the imaginary part, leading to entirely different results.

DONE.
