  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `become(Q(value))` is a call to the `become` function with the argument `Q(value)`, which is a promise that resolves to the value `value`. The new code fragment `become(Q(value))` is a call to the `become` function with the argument `Q(value)`, which is a promise that resolves to the value `value`. However, the new code fragment is missing the `Q` function call, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q.resolve(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `become(Q(value))` is a call to the `become` function with the argument `Q(value)`, which is a promise that resolves to the value `value`. The new code fragment `become(Q.resolve(value))` is a call to the `become`
