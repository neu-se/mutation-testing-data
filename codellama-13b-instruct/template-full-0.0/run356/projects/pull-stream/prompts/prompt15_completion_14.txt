  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `==`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `args` is `null`. This would allow the `pull` function to continue executing and potentially cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator is used instead of `==`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `args` is not `null`. This would cause the `pull` function to throw an error, which would indicate that the test suite is not effective in detecting this type of error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `args` is used instead of `args` itself. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `
