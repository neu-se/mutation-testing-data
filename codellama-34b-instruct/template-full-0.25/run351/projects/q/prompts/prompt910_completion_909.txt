  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the second argument instead of the first, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is not defined in the scope of the function, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` variable is not defined in the scope of the function, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
