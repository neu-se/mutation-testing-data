Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.existsSync(srcFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the source file instead of the destination file, potentially leading to incorrect handling of file copying.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!fs.existsSync(destFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the non-existence of the destination file, reversing the original logic and potentially causing the function to always overwrite the destination file or never throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always evaluates to true, causing the function to always check for the clobber option and potentially leading to unintended file deletion or error throwing, regardless of the actual existence of the destination file.

DONE.
