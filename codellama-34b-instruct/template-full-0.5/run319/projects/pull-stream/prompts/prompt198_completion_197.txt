  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `aborted` error to the callback function immediately, rather than waiting for the mapper to complete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `aborted` error to the `abortCb` function, which is not the same as the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the callback function, rather than the `aborted` error.

DONE.
