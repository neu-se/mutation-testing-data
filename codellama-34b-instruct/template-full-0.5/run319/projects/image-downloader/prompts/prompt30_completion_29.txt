  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight` would remove characters from the end of the string, rather than the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(1)` would return a substring starting from the second character, rather than the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the characters in the string, rather than removing them.

DONE.
