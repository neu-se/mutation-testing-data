Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the rounding of the `indices[r]` value from ceiling (rounding up) to floor (rounding down), potentially affecting the selection of elements in the `quantileSelect` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the index used in the `quantileSelect` function from `indices[r]` to `indices[r - 1]`, potentially selecting a different element or range of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
r
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the loop counter `r` directly to the `quantileSelect` function instead of using the value from the `indices` array, potentially causing the function to operate on an incorrect range of elements.

DONE.
