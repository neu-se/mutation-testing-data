  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `text` is included in `tmpUrl.text`, but the new code checks if `tmpUrl.text` includes `text`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!text.includes(tmpUrl.text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `text` is included in `tmpUrl.text`, but the new code checks if `tmpUrl.text` includes `text`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `text` is included in `tmpUrl.text`, but the new code checks if `tmpUrl.text` includes `text` from the start of the string.

DONE.
