  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the message property of the exception object, which may not exist or be different from the exception itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object with the exception object as the message, which would change the error message and potentially cause the application to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the exception object to the console, which may not be the intended behavior and could cause the application to behave differently.

DONE.
