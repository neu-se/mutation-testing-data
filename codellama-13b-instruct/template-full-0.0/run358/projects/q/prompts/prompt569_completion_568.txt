  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would be called instead of the `callback` function when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be called instead of the `errback` function when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would be called instead of the `callback` or `errback` function when the promise is settled.

DONE.
