 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.statSync(src).isDirectory()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the source is a directory using `fs.statSync` instead of checking if the input is a glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src.endsWith('.tar.gz')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the source ends with '.tar.gz' instead of checking if the input is a glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
zipArchive.globSync(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the synchronous version of `glob` instead of checking if the input is a glob pattern.

DONE.
