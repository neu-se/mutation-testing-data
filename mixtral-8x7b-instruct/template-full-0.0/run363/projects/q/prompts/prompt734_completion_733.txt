 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be returned instead of the original `promises` array, which could cause the `all` function to immediately resolve with an empty array instead of waiting for all input promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be returned instead of the original `promises` array, causing the `all` function to throw a `TypeError` when trying to reduce the `promises` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` (the current promise object) would be returned instead of the original `promises` array. This could cause the `all` function to behave unexpectedly, as it would not receive the input promises array and would immediately resolve with the current promise object.

DONE.
