  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method splits the string into an array of substrings, using the `/` character as the separator. In the original code, the `split` method was not used, and the `/` character was not used as a separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('\\')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method splits the string into an array of substrings, using the `\` character as the separator. In the original code, the `split` method was not used, and the `/` character was not used as a separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/./)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method splits the string into an array of substrings, using a regular expression that matches any character (except for line terminators) as the separator. In the original code, the `
