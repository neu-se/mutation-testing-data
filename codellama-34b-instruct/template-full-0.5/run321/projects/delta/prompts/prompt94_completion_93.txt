  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not add a new operation to the `ops` array, which could cause the `length` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not add a new operation to the `ops` array, which could cause the `length` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Op({ insert: '', attributes: {} })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would add a new operation with an empty string as the `insert` property and an empty object as the `attributes` property, which could cause the `length` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
