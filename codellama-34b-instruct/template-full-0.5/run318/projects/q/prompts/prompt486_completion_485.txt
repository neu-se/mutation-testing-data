  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called twice, which would reset the `unhandledRejections` array to an empty array, potentially hiding any unhandled rejections that occurred before the reset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly set the `length` property of the `unhandledRejections` array to 0, without calling the `resetUnhandledRejections` function. This could cause issues if the `resetUnhandledRejections` function has additional side effects that are not accounted for by simply setting the `length` property to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable the tracking of unhandled rejections, potentially hiding any unhand
