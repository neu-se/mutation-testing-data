  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if the value is Not-a-Number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if the value is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks if the value is a finite number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if the value is Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` function checks if the value is zero, whereas `isInfinite` checks if the value is Infinity.

DONE.
