  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only continues the loop if both `end` and `!test(data)` are false. However, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `end`, the loop will only continue if `end` is false. This means that if `test(data)` is true, the loop will not continue, even if `end` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data) || end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only continues the loop if `!test(data)` is true and `end` is false. However, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `!test(data) || end`, the loop will continue if `!test(data)` is true or `end` is false. This means that if `!test(data)` is true and `end` is true, the loop will continue, even though the original code fragment would have stopped the loop in this case.
