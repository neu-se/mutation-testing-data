  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `domain` variable to be `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `domain` variable to be `undefined`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain = "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `domain` variable to be a string, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses it.

DONE.
