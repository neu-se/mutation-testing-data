  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` function to always use the length of the `other` delta, rather than the length of the `this` delta, which could lead to incorrect composition of the two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
OP.length(thisOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` function to always use the length of the `thisOp` operation, rather than the length of the `otherOp` operation, which could lead to incorrect composition of the two operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(otherIter.peekLength(), length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` function to use the minimum of the length of the `other` delta and the length of the `this` delta, rather than the length of the `this` delta, which could lead to
