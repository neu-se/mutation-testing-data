  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `test` is a number, while this code checks if it's a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'boolean' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `test` is a number, while this code checks if it's a boolean.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'object' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `test` is a number, while this code checks if it's an object.

DONE.
