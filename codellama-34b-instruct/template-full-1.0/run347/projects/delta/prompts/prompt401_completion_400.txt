  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `thisData` as an object with an `attributes` property, rather than the value itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let someOtherData = thisData;
someOtherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `thisData` to a different variable before using it, potentially changing its value or causing other side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `thisData` if it is truthy, or `0` if it is falsy, potentially changing the result of the expression.

DONE.
