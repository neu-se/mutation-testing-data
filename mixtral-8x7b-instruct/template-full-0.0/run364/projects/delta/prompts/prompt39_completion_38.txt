 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a[key] == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator performs type coercion, which can lead to unexpected results compared to the strict equality `===` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof a[key] === 'undefined'
