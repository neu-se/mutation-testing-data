  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args]).then(function(result) {
    return result;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not use `then` to handle the promise returned by `dispatch`, and the new code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args]).catch(function(error) {
    throw error;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not use `catch` to handle the promise returned by `dispatch`, and the new code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args]).finally(function() {
    return Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args]);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not use `finally` to handle the promise returned by `dispatch`, and the new
