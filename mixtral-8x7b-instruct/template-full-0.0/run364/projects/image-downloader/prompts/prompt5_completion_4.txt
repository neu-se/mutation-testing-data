 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { throw new Error('The options.dest is required'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with an error object, it throws an error, which might not be properly handled by the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise instead of rejecting it, which might not be properly tested in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject(404)
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with a numeric error code instead of an error object, which might not be properly tested in the test suite.

By applying these mutations, you can test the robustness of the test suite and identify potential weaknesses in the testing strategy. DONE.
