  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `args.concat` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by the elements of the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.filter` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` that do not equal `1`, whereas `args.concat` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by the elements of the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(arg) { return arg + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` incremented by `
