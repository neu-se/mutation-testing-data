Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ attributes: { color: 'red' } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the attributes of the last line to a specific color instead of leaving it empty, which could affect how the line is rendered or processed later in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ attributes: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the attributes to `null`, which may lead to different handling in subsequent operations that expect an object, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ attributes: { fontWeight: 'bold' } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns a bold font weight to the last line, which could change the visual representation of the text in the application, affecting user experience.

DONE.
