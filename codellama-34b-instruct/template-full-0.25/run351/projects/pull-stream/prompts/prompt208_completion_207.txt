  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` would return the `aborted` error, while the new code fragment `null` would return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` would return the `aborted` error, while the new code fragment `undefined` would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` would return the `aborted` error, while the new code fragment `new Error('aborted')` would return a new error object with the message "aborted".

DONE.
