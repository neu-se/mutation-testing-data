  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is defined as `Math.abs(x) < 1e-9 ? 1 - x : (<PLACEHOLDER>(x) + Math.exp(-x)) * 0.5`, which means that for small values of `x`, `cosh` is approximated as `1 - x`. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `Math.exp(x)` would cause `cosh` to be approximated as `1 - Math.exp(x)`, which is not the same as the original approximation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is defined as `Math.abs(x) < 1e-9 ? 1 - x : (<PLACEHOLDER>(x) + Math.exp(-x)) * 0.5`, which means that for small values of `
