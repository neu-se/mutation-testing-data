  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `opData.length` would return the length of the `opData` object, which is not the same as `opData` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `opData.insert` would return the `insert` property of the `opData` object, which is not the same as `opData` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `opData.retain` would return the `retain` property of the `opData` object, which is not the same as `opData` itself.

DONE.
