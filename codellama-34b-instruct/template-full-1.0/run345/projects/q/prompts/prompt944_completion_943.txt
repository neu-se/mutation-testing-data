  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `thisp` to `null`, which would likely cause any subsequent use of `this` in the function to refer to the global object instead of the object passed in as a parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the length of the `arguments` object to 0, which would cause any subsequent use of the `arguments` object in the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object = void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `object` to `undefined`, which would likely cause any subsequent use of `object` in the function to throw an error.

DONE.
