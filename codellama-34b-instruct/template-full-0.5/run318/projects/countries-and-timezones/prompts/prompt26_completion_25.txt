  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the `dstOffset` value would change the result of the `getOffsetStr` function, which is used to generate the `dstOffsetStr` property of the returned object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `dstOffset` by 2 would change the result of the `getOffsetStr` function, which is used to generate the `dstOffsetStr` property of the returned object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the `dstOffset` value would change the result of the `getOffsetStr` function, which is used to generate the `dstOffsetStr` property of the returned object.

DONE.
