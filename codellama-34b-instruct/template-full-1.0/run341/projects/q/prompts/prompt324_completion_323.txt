  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw "Error"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because a different function is being called, which can lead to a different set of side effects and errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { return "Error"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because a different value is being returned, which can affect the flow of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { debug.log(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a different function is being called, which can lead to a different set of side effects and errors.

DONE.
