  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the entire string with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces the entire string with a single space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the entire string with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces the entire string with the word "hello".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the entire string with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces the entire string with the string "http://".

DONE.
