  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a control flow statement that interrupts the normal flow of a program, while `reject` is a method that returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` is a control flow statement that exits a function, while `reject` is a method that returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that is not a function, while `reject` is a method that returns a rejected promise.

DONE.
