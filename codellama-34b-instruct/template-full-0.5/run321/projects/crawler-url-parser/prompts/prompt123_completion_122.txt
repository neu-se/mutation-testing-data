  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` is a method that returns an iterator over the keys in the map, whereas `values` is a method that returns an iterator over the values in the map. In the original code, the `values` method is used to iterate over the values in the map and extract the URL and text information. If `keys` is used instead, the code will iterate over the keys in the map, which are the URLs, and extract the URL information, but not the text information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries` is a method that returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the map. In the original code, the `values` method is used to iterate over the values in the map and extract the URL and text information. If `entries` is used instead, the code will iterate over the key-value pairs in the map and extract both the URL and text information.

Option 3:
