  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to start two positions ahead of where it should, potentially missing some important content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to start one position behind where it should, potentially missing some important content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to start at the beginning of the string, rather than at the current position, potentially causing the function to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
