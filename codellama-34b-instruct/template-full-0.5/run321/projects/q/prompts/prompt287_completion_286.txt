  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve` would be called with a resolved promise, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value of the resolved promise, rather than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.reject` would be called with a rejected promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason of the rejected promise, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.notify(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.notify` would be called with a notification promise, which would cause the promise to be notified with the value of the notification promise, rather than the original value.

DONE.
