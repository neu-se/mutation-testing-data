  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, whereas the original code would only reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would end the output stream, whereas the original code would only reject the promise.

DONE.
