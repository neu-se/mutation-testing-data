  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so the code would error out if it tries to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so the code would error out if it tries to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ reviver: undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because `reviver` is not a function, so the code would error out if it tries to call it.

DONE.
