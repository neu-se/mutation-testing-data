  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is not being checked for equality with `false`, but rather it is being checked for its truthiness.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections != false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!trackUnhandledRejections` expression is being checked for inequality with `false`, which is always true because `!trackUnhandledRejections` is always `true` when `trackUnhandledRejections` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is being checked for strict equality with `false`, which is always false because `trackUnhandledRejections` is always `true` when `trackUnhandledRejections` is `false`.
