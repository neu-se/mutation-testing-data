  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(value, function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function is called with a different callback function that simply returns the value passed to it, rather than the original callback function that calls the `_progressed` function. This would cause the `deferred.notify` method to be called with the original value, rather than the value returned by the `_progressed` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(value, function (value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function is called with a different callback function that returns the value passed to it plus 1, rather than the original callback function that calls the `_progressed` function. This would cause the `deferred.notify` method to be called with the original value plus 1, rather than the value returned by the `_progressed` function.

Option 3: The
