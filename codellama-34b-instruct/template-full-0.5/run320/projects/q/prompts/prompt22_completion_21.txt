  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `true`, causing the `if` statement to always be entered, even if `domain` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `false`, causing the `if` statement to never be entered, even if `domain` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `domain`, causing the `if` statement to be entered if `domain` is not defined.

DONE.
