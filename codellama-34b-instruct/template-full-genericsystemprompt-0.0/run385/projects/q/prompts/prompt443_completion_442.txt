  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the stack trace of the reason object, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the message property of the reason object, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string representation of the reason object, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
