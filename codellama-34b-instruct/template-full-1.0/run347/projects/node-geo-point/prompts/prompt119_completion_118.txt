  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
22222222
```
This would result in different behavior because the integer 22222222 is different from the original value 180.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'PLACEHOLDER'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string literal 'PLACEHOLDER' is different from the original value 180.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant Math.PI is different from the original value 180.

DONE.
