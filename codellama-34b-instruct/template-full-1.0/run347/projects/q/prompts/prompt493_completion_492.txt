  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `undefined` instead of `rejected`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with `undefined` instead of a promise, and would likely cause errors in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `2` instead of `rejected`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with `2` instead of a promise, and would likely cause errors in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning `rejected`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with an error instead of a promise, and would likely cause errors in the surrounding code.

DONE.
