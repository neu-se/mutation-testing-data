  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `baseUrlStr` to lowercase, which could potentially cause issues if the URL is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the `baseUrlStr`, which could potentially cause issues if the URL is dependent on the order of the characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove the `http://` or `https://` protocol from the beginning of the `baseUrlStr`, which could potentially cause issues if the URL is dependent on the protocol.

DONE.
