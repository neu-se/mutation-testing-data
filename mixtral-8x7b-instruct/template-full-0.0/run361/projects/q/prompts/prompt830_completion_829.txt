 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `.fcall` directly invokes the node-style callback with the node-style resolver, while `.then` schedules the node-style callback with the resolver.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.spread
```
This would result in different behavior because `.spread` is used to handle an array of values as separate arguments, while `.then` just forwards the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.nodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because `.nodeify` is used to forward the node-style callback with the result or error, while `.then` schedules the callback with the resolver.

DONE.
