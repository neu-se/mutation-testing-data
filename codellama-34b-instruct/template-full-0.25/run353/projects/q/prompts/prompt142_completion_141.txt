  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `source` property of the promise, while this new code fragment uses the `value` property of the `source` object. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `source` object has a different structure than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `source` property of the promise, while this new code fragment uses the `promise` property of the `source` object. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `source` object has a different structure than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the
