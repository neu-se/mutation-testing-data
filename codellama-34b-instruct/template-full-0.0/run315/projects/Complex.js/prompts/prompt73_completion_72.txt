  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not call the `parser_exit` function with any arguments, while this modified code calls it with the argument `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not call the `parser_exit` function with any arguments, while this modified code calls it with the argument `tokens[i + 1]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(z['re']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not call the `parser_exit` function with any arguments, while this modified code calls it with the argument `z['re']`.

DONE.
