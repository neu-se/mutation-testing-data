  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if `err` is not equal to `true`. In this modified version, `cb` is called regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument if `err` is not equal to `true`. In this modified version, `cb` is called with `err` as the first argument regardless of its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with `data` as the second argument if `err` is not equal to `true`. In this modified version, `cb` is called with `null` as the second argument regardless of
