  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the index of the next operation to be processed, while this modified code fragment returns the index of the last operation processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the index of the next operation to be processed, while this modified code fragment returns the index of the operation after the next one to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex - length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the index of the next operation to be processed, while this modified code fragment returns the index of the operation before the previous one to be processed.

DONE.
