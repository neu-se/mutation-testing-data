  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.hostname == linkurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.hostname` and `linkurl.hostname` are different properties of the `URL` object, and they may not always be equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host != linkurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.host` and `linkurl.host` are different properties of the `URL` object, and they may not always be equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.protocol != linkurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.protocol` and `linkurl.protocol` are different properties of the `URL` object, and they may not always be equal.

DONE.
