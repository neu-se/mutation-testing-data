Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`), 'invalid_key');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is being called with an extra argument, which would not be expected by any of the existing event listeners.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`), {code: 'invalid_key'});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is being called with an object argument, which would not be expected by any of the
