  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method is called on the `otherIter` object, which is an instance of `OpIterator`. This would cause the `hasNext` method to be called on the `other` delta, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method is called on the `thisIter` object, which is an instance of `OpIterator`. This would cause the `hasNext` method to be called on the `this` delta, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is called on the `otherIter` object, which is an instance of `OpIterator`. This would cause the `peek` method to be called on the `other
