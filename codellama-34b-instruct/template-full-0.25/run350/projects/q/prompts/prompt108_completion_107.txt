  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to run indefinitely or not at all depending on the initial value of `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to run more quickly or slowly depending on the initial value of `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 1, but the code would be more verbose and less idiomatic.

DONE.
