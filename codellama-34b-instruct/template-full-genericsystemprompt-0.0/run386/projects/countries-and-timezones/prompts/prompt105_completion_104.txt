  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `tzs[key]` property would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different result than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `tzs[key]` property would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different result than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `tzs[key]` property would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return
