  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.keys()` would attempt to get the keys of `null` instead of the eventually settled object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.keys()` would attempt to get the keys of `undefined` instead of the eventually settled object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.keys()` would attempt to get the keys of `NaN` instead of the eventually settled object.

DONE.
