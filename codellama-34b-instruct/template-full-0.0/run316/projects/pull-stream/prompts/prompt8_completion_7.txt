  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources
```
This would result in different behavior because `sources` is a different object than `sinks`, and the code is using the `sinks` object to perform some operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs
```
This would result in different behavior because `throughs` is a different object than `sinks`, and the code is using the `sinks` object to perform some operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exports
```
This would result in different behavior because `exports` is a different object than `sinks`, and the code is using the `sinks` object to perform some operation.

DONE.
