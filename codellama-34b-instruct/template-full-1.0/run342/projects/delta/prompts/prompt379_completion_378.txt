  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the element at the specified index, whereas `push` is a method that adds new elements to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` is a method that removes the first element of an array and returns it, whereas `push` is a method that adds new elements to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` is a method that adds new elements to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` is a method that adds new elements to the end of an array.

DONE.
