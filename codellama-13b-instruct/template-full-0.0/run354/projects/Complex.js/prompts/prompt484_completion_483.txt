  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && define['amd']
```
This would result in different behavior because the second `define['amd']` is a typo and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && define['amd'] === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the second `define['amd']` is a typo and would cause a syntax error, and the third `define['amd'] === true` is redundant and would always evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && define['amd'] === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the second `define['amd']` is a typo and would cause a syntax error, and the third `define['amd'] === false` would cause the code to always evaluate to `false`, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
