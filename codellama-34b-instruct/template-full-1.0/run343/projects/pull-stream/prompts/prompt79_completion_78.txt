  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `next` function takes no arguments, while this new function takes two arguments, which would cause the `next` function to behave differently if it were called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next('hello')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `next` function takes no arguments, while this new function takes a single string argument, which would cause the `next` function to behave differently if it were called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `next` function takes no arguments, while this new function takes two identical arguments, which would cause the `next` function to behave differently if it were called.

DONE.
