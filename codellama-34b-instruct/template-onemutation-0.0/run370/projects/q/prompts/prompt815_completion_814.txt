  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `throw reason;`, but the buggy code fragment was `throw new Error(reason);`. The `throw` statement would throw an error with the message `reason`, while the `throw new Error(reason)` statement would throw an error with the message `Error: reason`.
