  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator would cause the `push` method to always insert the new operation at the end of the `ops` array, regardless of the `index` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator would cause the `push` method to always insert the new operation at the beginning of the `ops` array, regardless of the `index` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `push` method to always insert the new operation at the second-to-last position in the `ops` array, regardless of the `index` value.

DONE.
