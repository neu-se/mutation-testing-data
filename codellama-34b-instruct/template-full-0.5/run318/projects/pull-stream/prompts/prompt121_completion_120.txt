  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data; sink(source)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink(source)` would be called every time `data` is received, instead of only when `end` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data; sink(null, source)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink(null, source)` would be called every time `data` is received, instead of only when `end` is true. Additionally, the `null` argument would cause `sink` to be called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data; sink(data, source)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink(data, source)` would be called every time `data` is received, instead of only when `end` is true. Additionally, the `data` argument would cause `sink` to be called with a different argument than the original
