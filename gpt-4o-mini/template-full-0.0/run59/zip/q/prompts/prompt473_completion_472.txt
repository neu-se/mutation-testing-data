Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the next index in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, potentially leading to an "undefined" value being emitted instead of the correct promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the first element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, regardless of which promise was actually being untracked, leading to incorrect tracking of handled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the index of the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the index in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, potentially causing mismatches in the emitted events.

DONE.
