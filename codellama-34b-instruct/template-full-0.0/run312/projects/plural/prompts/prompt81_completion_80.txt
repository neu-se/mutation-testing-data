  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a tuple of two strings, while the new code fragment is a single string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a tuple of two strings, while the new code fragment is a single string with a repeated value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'gose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a tuple of two strings, while the new code fragment is a single string with a different value.

DONE.
