 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks for string equality, ignoring other types of equality checks that the original `isEqual` function might perform.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert.length === otherOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks for length equality, ignoring other types of equality checks that the original `isEqual` function might perform.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns true, regardless of the values of `thisOp.insert` and `otherOp.insert`.

DONE.
