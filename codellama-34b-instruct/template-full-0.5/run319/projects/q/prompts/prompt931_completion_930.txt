  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` is a different function that wraps a NodeJS continuation passing function and returns an equivalent version that returns a promise, while `Q.denodeify` is a different function that wraps a NodeJS continuation passing function and returns an equivalent version that returns a promise, but with a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfcall` is a different function that passes a continuation to a Node function, which is called with the given arguments provided individually, and returns a promise, while `Q.denodeify` is a different function that wraps a NodeJS continuation passing function and returns an equivalent version that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a different function
