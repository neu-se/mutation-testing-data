 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` is the global sinh function, while `sinh` is a locally defined function. This change may cause incorrect results or errors if the local `sinh` function relies on specific behavior or state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-sinh
