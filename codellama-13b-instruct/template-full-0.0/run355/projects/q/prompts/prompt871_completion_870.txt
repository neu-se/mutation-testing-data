  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be passed as the first argument to the `callback` function, rather than being spread as individual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, rather than the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be called with an empty array as the first argument, rather than the `args` array.

DONE.
