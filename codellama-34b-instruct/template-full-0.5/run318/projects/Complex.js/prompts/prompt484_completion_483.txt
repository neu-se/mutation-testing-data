  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `define` is a function and `define.amd` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `define` is a function and `define.amd` is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define !== 'function' || define['amd'] === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `define` is a function and `define.amd` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `define` is not a function or `define.amd` is strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define['amd'] !== 'function' || define['amd'] === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `define` is a function and `define.amd` is truthy, while
