  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always returns `true`, while the new code fragment `false` always returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always returns `true`, while the new code fragment `null` always returns `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always returns `true`, while the new code fragment `!value` returns the negation of `value`.

DONE.
