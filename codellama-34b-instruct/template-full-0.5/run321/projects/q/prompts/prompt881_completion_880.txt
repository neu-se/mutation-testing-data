  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is called with the `error` object, which would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code called `deferred.makeNodeResolver`, which would have resolved the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is called with the `error` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the `error` object, whereas the original code called `deferred.makeNodeResolver`, which would have resolved the promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is called with the `error` object, which would cause the promise to be notified with the `error` object, whereas the original code called `de
