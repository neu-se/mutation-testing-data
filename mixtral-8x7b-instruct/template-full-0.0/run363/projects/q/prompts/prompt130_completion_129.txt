 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` array may contain `null` values, which is not allowed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` array will contain an extra element with the value `1`, which is not a property name in the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` array will contain a function object, which is not a string and not a valid property name in the original object.

DONE.
