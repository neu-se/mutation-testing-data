  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.prototype.substring` is a different method than `String.prototype.substr` and would return a different result for the same inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always skip the first character of the input string, whereas the original code fragment does not have this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(w.length-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always start from the last character of the input string, whereas the original code fragment does not have this behavior.

DONE.
