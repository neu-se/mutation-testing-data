  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` calls the `cb` function with the `aborted` argument, while the new code fragment `abortCb(aborted)` calls the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` argument. This could potentially cause a different behavior in the program, depending on how the `abortCb` function is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` calls the `cb` function with the `aborted` argument, while the new code fragment `null` does not call any function. This could potentially cause a different behavior in the program, depending on how the `cb` function is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` calls
