 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.denodeify.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would explicitly set the `this` context to the first argument, while `apply` sets the `this` context to the first argument and accepts an array for the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will have its `this` value set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.denodeify.prototype
