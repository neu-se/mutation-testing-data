  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a null value, but undefined would be passed instead, which could cause unexpected behavior in the map function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{data: null}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a null value, but an object with a null data property would be passed instead, which could cause unexpected behavior in the map function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a null value, but a string "null" would be passed instead, which could cause unexpected behavior in the map function.

DONE.
