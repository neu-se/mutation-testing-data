  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This change will cause the request to be made using the `http` module instead of the `https` module, which may result in a different response from the server.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'httpss'
```
This change will cause the request to be made using a non-existent module, which will result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http' + 's'
```
This change will cause the request to be made using the `http` module with the `s` option, which may result in a different response from the server.

DONE.
