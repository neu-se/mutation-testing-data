  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method of the generator would be called with `null` as an argument, which would cause it to return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` instead of a fulfilled promise with the next value from the generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method of the generator would be called with `undefined` as an argument, which would cause it to return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` instead of a fulfilled promise with the next value from the generator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method of the generator would be called with `"foo"` as an argument, which would cause it to return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` instead of a fulfilled promise with the next value from the generator.

DONE.
