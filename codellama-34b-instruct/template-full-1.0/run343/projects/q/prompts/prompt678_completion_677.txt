  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Q(object).dispatch("invoke", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])`. This would result in different behavior because instead of using the "post" method, it would use "invoke" which would have a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]`. This would result in different behavior because the arguments list for the `array_slice` method would change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Promise.prototype.dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])`. This would result in different behavior because it would now be a method of the `Promise` prototype.

DONE.
