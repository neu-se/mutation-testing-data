  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the callback with the `end` value, regardless of whether the `map` function was called or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the callback with the `1` value, regardless of whether the `map` function was called or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the `null` value, regardless of whether the `map` function was called or not.

DONE.
