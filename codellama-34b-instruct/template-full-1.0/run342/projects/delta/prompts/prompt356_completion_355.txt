  Mutation testing is a technique used in software testing to identify defects in a program's source code. By making small changes to a program's code and then observing how the program responds to the changes, a tester can identify points in the code where the program may be vulnerable to defects.

In the code fragment provided, the PLACEHOLDER is a reference to the function `this.transformPosition`. To test this function, mutation testing can be used to introduce bugs into the code that would cause the function to behave differently. For example, the PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with the following code to create a mutation:
```
this.transformPosition(index, true)
```
This would cause the `transformPosition` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment. The mutation testing process would then observe how the program behaves with the modified function and determine if the modifications cause any defects or unexpected behavior.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition(index, true)
```
This would cause the `transformPosition` function to
