Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly calls `array_slice` with `arguments` as the context, which may lead to unexpected results if `array_slice` is not designed to handle the `arguments` object correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the native `Array.prototype.slice` method instead of the `array_slice` function, which may have different implementations or behaviors, especially if `array_slice` has been modified or wrapped in a different way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the `arguments` object without converting it to an array, which would lead to the original code expecting an array but receiving an `arguments` object instead, potentially causing errors in subsequent operations.

DONE.
