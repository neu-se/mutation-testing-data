  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, while the new code fragment checks if it is a number. This change would cause the function to return a different value in some cases, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.
