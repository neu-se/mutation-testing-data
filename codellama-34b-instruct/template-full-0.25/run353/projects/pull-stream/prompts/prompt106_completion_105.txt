  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done()
```
This would result in different behavior because `done()` is a function call, while `done` is a variable reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `done`, and could potentially cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `done`, and could potentially cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

DONE.
