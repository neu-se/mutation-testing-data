  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method is called on the `rule` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method is called on the `rule` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method is called on the `rule` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
