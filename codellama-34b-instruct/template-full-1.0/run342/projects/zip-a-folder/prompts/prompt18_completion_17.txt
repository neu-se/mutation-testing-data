  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise XOR operator `^` has a different precedence than the bitwise OR operator `|`, so the resulting value would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK * fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` has a different precedence than the bitwise operators `|` and `^`, so the resulting value would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK + fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator `+` has a different precedence than the bitwise operators `|` and `^`, so the resulting value would be different.

DONE.
