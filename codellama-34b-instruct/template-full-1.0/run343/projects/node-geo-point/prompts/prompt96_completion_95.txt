  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(y, x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` returns the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments, whereas `atan2` returns the arctangent of the quotient of the arguments with the arguments cancelled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(sinθ * sinδ * cosφ1 / cosδ−sinφ1 * sinφ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations is different, and `Math.atan` uses radians, whereas `atan2` uses degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(sinθ * sinδ + cosφ1 * cosδ * cosθ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula is different.

DONE.
