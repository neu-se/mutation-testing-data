  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` returns an already fulfilled promise, whereas `Q(object)` returns a promise that is pending until `object` is settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` returns an already fulfilled promise with a value of `undefined`, whereas `Q(object)` returns a promise that is pending until `object` is settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q({})` returns an already fulfilled promise with a value of the empty object, whereas `Q(object)` returns a promise that is pending until `object` is settled.

DONE.
