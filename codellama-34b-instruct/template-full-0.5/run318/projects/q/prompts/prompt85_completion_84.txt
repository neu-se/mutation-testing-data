  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function as its argument, and passing `null` would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` would be called with an empty function, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is not defined in the provided code, and passing it as an argument to `requestTick` would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
