  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise.then(function () {
    return deferred.promise;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a different value, which would cause the `then` method to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject(new Error("error"));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with an error, which would cause the `then` method to be called with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise.then(function () {
    return Q.resolve(deferred.promise);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a different value, which would cause the `then` method to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
