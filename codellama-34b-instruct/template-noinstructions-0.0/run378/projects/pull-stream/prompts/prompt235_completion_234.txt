  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the function to exit immediately, without calling the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(end, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function would be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
