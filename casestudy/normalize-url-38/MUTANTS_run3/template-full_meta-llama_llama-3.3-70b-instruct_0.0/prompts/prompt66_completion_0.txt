Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!opts.stripWWW && /^www\.([a-z\-\d]{2,63})\.([a-z\.]{2,5})$/.test(urlObj.hostname)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of `opts.stripWWW`, causing the `www.` to be removed when `stripWWW` is `false`, and not removed when `stripWWW` is `true`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
opts.stripWWW && /^www\.([a-z\-\d]{1,63})\.([a-z\.]{1,5})$/.test(urlObj.hostname)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now allows for shorter domain name labels and extensions, which could lead to incorrect removal of `www.` from hostnames that do not meet the original criteria.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
opts.stripWWW && urlObj.hostname.startsWith('www.')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method does not check
