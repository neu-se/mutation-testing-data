  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `==` operator, which checks for equality, while this new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for non-equality. This means that even if `test` and `data` have the same value, the new code fragment would consider them different, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `test` function to check if `data` is empty, while this new code fragment uses the `length` property to check if `test` is empty. If `test` is a function, this could cause the test to fail even if `data` is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.match(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `test` function to check if
