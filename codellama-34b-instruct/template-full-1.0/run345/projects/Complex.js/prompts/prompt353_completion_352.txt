  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calculating the sum of the squares of the inputs, but this new code fragment is calculating the product of the inputs and a constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calculating the sum of the squares of the inputs, but this new code fragment is calculating the difference of the square of the input and a constant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * c - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calculating the sum of the squares of the inputs, but this new code fragment is calculating the difference of the square of the input and a constant.

DONE.
