  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument of `1`, which would cause the last operation in the delta to be removed, rather than the default behavior of removing all consecutive operations of the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument of `2`, which would cause the last two operations in the delta to be removed, rather than the default behavior of removing all consecutive operations of the same type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with an argument of `3`, which would cause the last three operations in the delta to be removed, rather than the default behavior of removing all consecutive operations of the same type.

DONE.
