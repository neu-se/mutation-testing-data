  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in the function always returning `0`, regardless of the actual length of the `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in the function always returning `-1`, regardless of the actual length of the `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length + 1
```
This would result in the function always returning a value that is one greater than the actual length of the `Delta` object.

DONE.
