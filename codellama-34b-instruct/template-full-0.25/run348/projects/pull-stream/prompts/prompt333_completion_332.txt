  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if `end` is not true, whereas this new code fragment would call it regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function as is, whereas this new code fragment would pass a modified version of `data` that is one greater than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function as is, whereas this new code fragment would pass `null` as the `data` argument.

DONE.
