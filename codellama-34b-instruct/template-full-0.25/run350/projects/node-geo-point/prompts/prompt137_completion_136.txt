  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the latitude instead of the longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the longitude by adding 1 instead of adjusting it to the specified precision.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would adjust the longitude by multiplying it by 2 instead of adjusting it to the specified precision.

DONE.
