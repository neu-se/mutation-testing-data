  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be increased by 1, which could cause the algorithm to skip over a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be decreased by 1, which could cause the algorithm to miss a necessary operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be doubled, which could cause the algorithm to perform unnecessary operations.

DONE.
