  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is not a valid method for the "dispatch" function, and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the "keys" method should be an empty array, but passing [1] would cause the method to return the keys of the object at index 1, rather than the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", ["foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the "keys" method should be an empty array, but passing ["foo"] would cause the method to return the keys of the object at index "foo", rather than the object itself.

DONE.
