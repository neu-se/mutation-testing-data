  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra `then` method to the promise, which could potentially change the behavior of the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value; }, function(reason) { throw reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra `then` method to the promise, which could potentially change the behavior of the promise chain, and also adds a rejection handler that could potentially change the behavior of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function(reason) { throw reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a rejection handler to the promise, which could potentially change the behavior of the promise.

DONE.
