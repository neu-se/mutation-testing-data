  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex['NAN']` is a different value than `Complex['INFINITY']`, and would cause the `add`, `sub`, and `mul` methods to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex['INFINITY']` is a different value than `Complex['NAN']`, and would cause the `add`, `sub`, and `mul` methods to return a different result.
