 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the longitude, regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number between 0 and 1, instead of the actual longitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value of the current object instead of the input value.

DONE.
