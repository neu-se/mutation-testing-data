 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately terminate the process, not allowing the rest of the code to execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null error instead of the abort value, potentially causing the rest of the code to continue executing when it shouldn't.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would print a message to the console instead of calling the callback function, which could cause the rest of the code to continue executing when it shouldn't.

DONE.
