  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a == null` checks if `a` is null or undefined, while `typeof a !== 'object'` only checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== Object(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object(a)` converts `a` to an object, and then checks if it is not equal to `a`. This would catch cases where `a` is not an object, but also cases where `a` is an object that is not equal to itself, such as `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a || typeof a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is falsy or not an object, which is a more comprehensive check than just checking if `a` is not an object.

DONE.
