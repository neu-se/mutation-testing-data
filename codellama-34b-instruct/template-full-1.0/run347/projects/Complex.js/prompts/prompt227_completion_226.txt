  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sqrt(Math.abs(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of `Math.sqrt` and
`Math.abs` here would not account for the possibility of `b` being zero or
negative, which could cause the output to differ from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sqrt(b ** 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of `b ** 2` would
cause the output to be non-integer for certain values of `b`, which could
cause the program to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.abs(b / b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of `Math.abs` and
dividing by `b` could cause the output of `Math.sqrt` to differ from the
original code.

DONE.
