  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(/\d+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match numeric characters, whereas the original code fragment would match any non-slash character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(/\w+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match alphanumeric characters and underscores, whereas the original code fragment would match any non-slash character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(/.+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character, including slashes, whereas the original code fragment would only match non-slash characters.

DONE.
