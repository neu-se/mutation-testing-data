  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER cannot be replaced with any operation that yields the same result as the original code fragment, since it is searching for specific words in a specific order. Any attempt to change the order of the words, remove a word, or change the regular expression would result in no matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:buffalo|deer|sheep|goat)\b/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regular expression matches different words. The original regular expression matches only words that end in -s or -es, while the new regular expression matches only words that end in -s or -es or are a single word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose)\b/i, function(w) { return w.toLowerCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regular expression matches the same words as the original
