  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because "getCountry" is a different function than "getTimezone" and would return a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getAllTimezones
```
This would result in different behavior because "getAllTimezones" is a different function than "getTimezone" and would return a different object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountryForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because "getCountryForTimezone" is a different function than "getTimezone" and would return a different object.

DONE.
