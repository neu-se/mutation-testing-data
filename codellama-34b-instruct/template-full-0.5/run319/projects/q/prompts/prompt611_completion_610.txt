  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.get` would be replaced with `Q.set`, which would result in the value of the property being set instead of retrieved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.get` would be replaced with `Q.delete`, which would result in the property being deleted instead of retrieved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.get` would be replaced with `Q.post`, which would result in a POST request being sent instead of a GET request.

DONE.
