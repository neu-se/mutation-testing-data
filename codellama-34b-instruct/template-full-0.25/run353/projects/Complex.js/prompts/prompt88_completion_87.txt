  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next token in the array, potentially causing the parser to misinterpret the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the previous token in the array, potentially causing the parser to misinterpret the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current token in the array, potentially causing the parser to misinterpret the input.

DONE.
