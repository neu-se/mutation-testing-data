  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would always return `true`, even if there is no extension in the path. In contrast, `path.extname` would return the extension of the path, if it exists, or an empty string if it doesn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.extname === 'jpeg'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the extension is `jpeg`, whereas the original code checks for any extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.extname.includes('jpeg')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the extension includes `jpeg`, whereas the original code checks for equality.

DONE.
