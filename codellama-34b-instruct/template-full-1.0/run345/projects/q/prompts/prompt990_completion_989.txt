  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array, whereas `arguments` is an object that contains the arguments passed to the containing function. By replacing `arguments` with `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, the function would be passing a copy of the arguments array instead of the original arguments object, which could result in unexpected behavior if the function being called expects to modify the arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[0]` would only pass the first argument of the containing function, whereas `arguments` would pass all of the arguments. This could result in the function being called with incomplete or incorrect information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method of arrays, whereas `arguments` is an object that does
