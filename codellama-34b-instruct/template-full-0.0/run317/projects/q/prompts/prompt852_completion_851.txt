  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `error` object, which would have been passed to the `deferred.reject` method, causing the promise to be rejected. By replacing it with `null`, the promise would be resolved with a value of `null`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `error` object, which would have been passed to the `deferred.reject` method, causing the promise to be rejected. By replacing it with `undefined`, the promise would be resolved with a value of `undefined`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `error` object, which would have been passed
