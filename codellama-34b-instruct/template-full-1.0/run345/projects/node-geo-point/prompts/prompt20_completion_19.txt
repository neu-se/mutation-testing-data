  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty(<random property name>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is checking if `<random property name>` exists on the `object` instead of checking if `latitude` and `longitude` exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.getOwnPropertyNames()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOwnPropertyNames` method returns an array of all property names on the `object`, but the `[0]` index is selecting the first property name rather than the `latitude` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.getOwnPropertyNames()[<random index>]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<random index>` is selecting a different property name other than `latitude` or `longitude`.

DONE.
