  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed from `'error'` to `'warn'`, which would not trigger the same event listeners as before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'exception'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed from `'error'` to `'exception'`, which would not trigger the same event listeners as before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'uncaughtException'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed from `'error'` to `'uncaughtException'`, which would not trigger the same event listeners as before.

DONE.
