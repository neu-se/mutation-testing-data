  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split('&')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the search query into an array of key-value pairs, while the original code fragment would split it into an array of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the search query into an array of individual characters, then reverse the order of the characters, finally joining them back into a single string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.substring(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would truncate the search query to only the first 10 characters, while the original code fragment would split the search query into individual key-value pairs.

DONE.
