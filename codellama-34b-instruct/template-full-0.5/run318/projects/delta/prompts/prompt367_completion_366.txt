  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the strict equality operator (`===`), which checks for both value and type equality, while the replaced code fragment uses the abstract equality operator (`!==`), which checks only for value equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the abstract equality operator (`===`), which checks only for value equality, while the replaced code fragment uses the strict equality operator (`===`), which checks for both value and type equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less-than operator (`<`), which checks if the length of the current operation in the `thisIter` iterator is less than the length of the current operation
