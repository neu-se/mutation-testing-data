  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array, while `reverse` is a property that returns the reverse of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in an array, while `reverse` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new array with the first element removed, while `reverse` returns a new array with the elements in reverse order.

DONE.
