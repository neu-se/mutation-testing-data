  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the new code fragment `-cb` is a unary minus operation applied to the function `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function reference, while the new code fragment `cb()` is a function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var x = cb
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function reference, while the new code fragment `var x = cb; x` is a variable assignment and a function call.

DONE.
