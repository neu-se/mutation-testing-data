  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function would be called with a `null` argument, which would cause it to exit the loop immediately, even if there are more data to be read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function would be called with an `undefined` argument, which would cause it to exit the loop immediately, even if there are more data to be read.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function would be called with the `read` function as an argument, which would cause it to enter an infinite loop, as the `read` function would continue to call itself recursively.

DONE.
