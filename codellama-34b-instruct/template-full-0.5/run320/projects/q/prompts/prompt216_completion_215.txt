  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coerce(value).then(fulfill, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a rejected promise, rather than a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coerce(reject).then(fulfill, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a resolved promise, rather than a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coerce(value).then(reject, fulfill);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a rejected promise, rather than a resolved promise.

DONE.
