  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the error object to the callback functions, while the replaced code fragment would pass null instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the error object to the callback functions, while the replaced code fragment would pass undefined instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Dummy error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the error object to the callback functions, while the replaced code fragment would pass a new error object with the message 'Dummy error' instead.

DONE.
