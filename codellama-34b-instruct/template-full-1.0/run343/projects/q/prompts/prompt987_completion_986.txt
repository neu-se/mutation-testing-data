  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `nodeArgs` array with the `name` field, forming a new array instead of creating a new array with `name` and `nodeArgs` as elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, ...nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the spread operator to create a new array with `name` as the first element and then concatenates the `nodeArgs` array to it, forming a new array with a different structure than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with `nodeArgs` as the first element and `name` as the second element, inverting the order of the original code.

DONE.
