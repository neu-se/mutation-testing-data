  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise, while `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise. This would cause the `image` function to return a resolved promise instead of a rejected promise, which could result in unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new File('invalid_file_path')
```
This would result in different behavior because `File` is a constructor function that creates a new file object, and passing an invalid file path would cause the `File` constructor to throw an error. This would cause the `image` function to throw an error instead of returning a promise, which could result in unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject('custom error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` takes an optional error message argument, which would cause the `image` function to
