 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove everything from the '#' character onwards, instead of just the portion matching '.<any character>*' (i.e., the fragment identifier).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.+$/, ''
