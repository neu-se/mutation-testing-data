  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 0 instead of 1, and would therefore skip the first element in the `arguments` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 2 instead of 1, and would therefore skip the first two elements in the `arguments` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last element in the `arguments` array, and would therefore skip all the other elements.

DONE.
