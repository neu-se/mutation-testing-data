  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a` and adds 1, while the replaced code fragment calculates the square of `a` and subtracts 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a` and adds 1, while the replaced code fragment calculates the product of `a` and `b` and adds 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a` and adds 1, while the replaced code fragment calculates the sum of `a` and the reciprocal of `b`.

DONE.
