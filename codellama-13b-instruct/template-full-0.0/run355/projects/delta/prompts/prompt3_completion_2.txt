  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cloneDeep` function is not defined in the `lodash.clonedeep` module, and therefore the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function is not defined in the `lodash.isequal` module, and therefore the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys` function is not defined in the `lodash.clonedeep` module, and therefore the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
