  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, nextChunk)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nextChunk` was already called, while `read(null, nextChunk)` would call `nextChunk` again.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream = nextChunk
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nextChunk` was the function being called, while `nextStream = nextChunk` would assign `nextChunk` to `nextStream` without calling it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk = nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nextChunk` was the function being called, while `nextChunk = nextStream` would assign `nextStream` to `nextChunk` without calling it.

DONE.
