Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allResolved` function to call the `all` function instead, which would reject the promise if any of the input promises are rejected, contrary to the intended behavior of `allResolved`, which should never reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with the input `promises`, regardless of their state, instead of resolving with an array of promises that have settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promises.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the length of the `promises` array instead of resolving with the array of promises themselves, which would not provide the expected results for the caller.

DONE.
