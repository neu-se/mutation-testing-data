  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has only one argument, while the modified code fragment checks if it has more than one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has only one argument, while the modified code fragment checks if it has no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has only one argument, while the modified code fragment checks if it has fewer than one argument.

DONE.
