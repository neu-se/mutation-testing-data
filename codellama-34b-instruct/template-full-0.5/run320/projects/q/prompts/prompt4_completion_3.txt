  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would be incremented by 1, which could cause the program to behave differently if it relies on the specific value of the `definition` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the program to behave differently if it relies on the specific value of the `definition` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would be decremented by 1, which could cause the program to behave differently if it relies on the specific value of the `definition` function.

DONE.
