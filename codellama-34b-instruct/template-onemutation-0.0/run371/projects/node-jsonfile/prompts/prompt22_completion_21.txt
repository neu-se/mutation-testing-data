  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\ufeff/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `stripBom` function to remove the BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the beginning of the file, while the new code uses the `replace` method to remove the BOM. The `replace` method will only remove the first occurrence of the BOM, while the `stripBom` function will remove all occurrences of the BOM.

DONE.
