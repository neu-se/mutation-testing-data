  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, {
	ignoreWhitespace: true
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ignoreWhitespace` option would cause Cheerio to ignore any whitespace characters in the input HTML, while the original code fragment does not use this option. This could potentially alter the behavior of the `domain` and `subdomain` properties, which are derived from the parsed URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, {
	ignoreScripts: true
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ignoreScripts` option would cause Cheerio to ignore any `<script>` tags in the input HTML, while the original code fragment does not use this option. This could potentially alter the behavior of the `type` property, which is derived from the parsed URL and the contents of the `<a>` tag.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, {
