  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read stream to error out, which would trigger the `error` event to be emitted, rather than the `end` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read stream to be destroyed without emitting any events, which would prevent the `load` event from being emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read stream to error out, which would trigger the `error` event to be emitted, rather than the `end` event.

DONE.
