  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, which could cause the code to skip over some elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at -1 instead of 0, which could cause the code to start at the wrong index in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = "0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the string "0" instead of the number 0, which could cause the code to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
