  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function would return a different value, which would affect the calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg - 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function would return a different value, which would affect the calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant would be used instead of the `deg2rad` function, which would affect the calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
