  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regex global and can match multiple occurrences in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which makes the regex case-insensitive, so it would also match "/Default.html" or "/default.HTML".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag is added, which makes the regex multi-line, so it would also match "/default.html" at the beginning of a line, not just at the end of the string.

DONE.
