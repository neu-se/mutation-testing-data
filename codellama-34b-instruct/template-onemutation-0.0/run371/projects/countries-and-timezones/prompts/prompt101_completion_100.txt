  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `deprecated` property is not truthy, while the new code fragment checks if it is truthy. This would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different set of timezones.

DONE.
