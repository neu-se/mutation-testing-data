  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `value`
This would result in different behavior because the value argument is not used in the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `promise.resolve()`
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be resolved with the specified value, whereas the original function returns the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `promise.reject()`
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be rejected with the specified reason, whereas the original function returns the original promise.

DONE.
