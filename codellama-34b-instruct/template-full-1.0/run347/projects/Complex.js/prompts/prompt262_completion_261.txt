  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1, b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` would be 1 higher than they were before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` would be 1 lower than it was before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1, b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` would be 1 lower and `b` would be 1 higher than they were before.

DONE.
