  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the `key` property is not defined in the `row` object, while `row.key === undefined` checks if the `key` property is undefined in the `row` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.hasOwnProperty('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the `key` property is not defined in the `row` object, while `!row.hasOwnProperty('key')` checks if the `key` property is not defined in the `row` object or if it is inherited from the object's prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key !== 'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the `key` property is not defined in the `row` object,
