  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable in the `nbind` method would be null instead of an array, causing the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable in the `nbind` method would be undefined instead of an array, causing the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable in the `nbind` method would be a string instead of an array, causing the function to throw an error.

DONE.
