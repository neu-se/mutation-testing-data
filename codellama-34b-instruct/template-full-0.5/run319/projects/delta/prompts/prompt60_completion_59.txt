  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `arg` is a string, while this code fragment checks if `arg` is a number. If `arg` is a number, the original code fragment would return `false`, while this code fragment would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `arg` is a string with length 0, while this code fragment checks if `arg` is an empty string. If `arg` is an empty string, the original code fragment would return `true`, while this code fragment would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `arg` is a string with length 0, while this code fragment checks if `arg` has a length property that is equal to 0
