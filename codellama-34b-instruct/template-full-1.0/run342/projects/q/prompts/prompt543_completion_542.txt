  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[array.length]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the array as the "this" argument, instead of undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[array[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the array as the "this" argument, instead of undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this.length]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the this object as the "this" argument, instead of undefined.

DONE.
