 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
snapshot.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check if the promise is in the "pending" state instead of the "fulfilled" state. The test suite should include a test case that checks if the `all` function correctly handles fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isPromise(promise) && (snapshot = promise).state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now directly assigns `promise` to `snapshot` instead of calling the `inspect` method. The test suite should include a test case that checks if the `all` function correctly handles promises with properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isPromise(promise) && snapshot.state === "completed"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now checks if the promise is in the "completed" state instead of the "fulfilled
