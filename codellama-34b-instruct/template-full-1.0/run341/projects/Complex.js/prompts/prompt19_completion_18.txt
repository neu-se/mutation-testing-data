  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```b```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the variable `b` as the second argument for `hypot()`, instead of `y`, which is the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```const y = x```.
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `x` to a new variable `y`, which would then be used as the second argument for `hypot()`, instead of the original value of `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```x + y```.
This would result in different behavior because it would add `x` and `y` together and use the result as the second argument for `hypot()`, instead of using `y` as the original code fragment.

DONE.
