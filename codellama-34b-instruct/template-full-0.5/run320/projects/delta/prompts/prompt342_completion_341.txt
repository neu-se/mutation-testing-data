  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = <PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable would be assigned a different value, potentially causing the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable would be assigned a different value based on the `otherOp` object, potentially causing the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable would be assigned a different value based on the `thisOp` object, potentially causing the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return different values.

DONE.
