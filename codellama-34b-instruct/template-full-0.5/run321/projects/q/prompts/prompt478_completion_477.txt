  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `1` constant, which is a truthy value, and the new code fragment is using the `0` constant, which is a falsy value. This could cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with a different set of arguments, which could lead to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `1` constant, which is a truthy value, and the new code fragment is using the `-1` constant, which is a falsy value. This could cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with a different set of arguments, which could lead to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `1` constant, which is a truthy value, and the
