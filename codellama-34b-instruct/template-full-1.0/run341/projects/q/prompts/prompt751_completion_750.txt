  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because a new promise would be created and the `allResolved` method would be called on it.

DONE.
