  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` function with the `value` argument, whereas the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(value, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` function with two identical `value` arguments, whereas the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(value, value, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` function with three identical `value` arguments, whereas the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to the `callback` function.

DONE.
