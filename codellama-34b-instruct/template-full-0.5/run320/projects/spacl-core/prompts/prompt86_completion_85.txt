  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(null, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with invalid arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with different arguments, which would create a new policy with the same name and rules as the original policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with different arguments, which would create a new policy with the same name and rules as the original policy, but without cloning the underlying rules.

DONE.
