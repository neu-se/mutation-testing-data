  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` as the second argument to `atan2`, but the new code fragment uses `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `1` as the first argument to `atan2`, but the new code fragment uses `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `1` as both arguments to `atan2`, but the new code fragment uses `a` and `b`.

DONE.
