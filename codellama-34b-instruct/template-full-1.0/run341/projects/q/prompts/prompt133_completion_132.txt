  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because "null" is a string while "Object" is the global object, and "Object" has a different output when used as the left-hand side operand of the === operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because NaN is a special value in JavaScript that represents a mathematical value that is undefined or cannot be represented in a finite number of digits. It is not equal to itself or any other value, including undefined and null, even with the == operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is a primitive value that represents an uninitialized variable or a missing parameter, while "Object" is the global object, which is a constructor function for creating objects.

DONE.
