  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback, whereas `promise` is the original promise that is being iterated over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise[Symbol.iterator]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Symbol.iterator` is a well-known symbol that is used to retrieve the iterator for an object, whereas `promise` is a promise object that does not have an iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = Promise.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a new promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `promise` is the original promise that is being iterated over.

DONE.
