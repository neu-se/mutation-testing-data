  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the element is null before accessing its properties, but the new code fragment would throw an error if the element is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the element is undefined before accessing its properties, but the new code fragment would throw an error if the element is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the element is an object before accessing its properties, but the new code fragment would throw an error if the element is not an object.

DONE.
