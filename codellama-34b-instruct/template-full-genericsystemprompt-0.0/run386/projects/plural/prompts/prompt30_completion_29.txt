  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|error/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes the word "error" which would not have been matched by the original fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes the word "thesis" twice, which would cause the regular expression to match twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes the word "crisis" twice, which would cause the regular expression to match twice.

DONE.
