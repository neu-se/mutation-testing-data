  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'drain'` event is not emitted when an error occurs, while the `'error'` event is emitted in this situation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'drain'` event is not emitted when the connection is closed, while the `'close'` event is emitted in this situation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'drain'` event is not emitted when the write stream has finished writing all data, while the `'finish'` event is emitted in this situation.

DONE.
