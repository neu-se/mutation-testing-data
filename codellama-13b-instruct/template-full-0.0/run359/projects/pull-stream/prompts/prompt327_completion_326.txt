  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called with `true` as the argument, which would cause the `onEnd` callback to be called with `null` as the argument, which would indicate that the stream has ended successfully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called with `false` as the argument, which would cause the `onEnd` callback to be called with `null` as the argument, which would indicate that the stream has ended successfully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called with `undefined` as the argument, which would cause the `onEnd` callback to be called with `null` as the argument, which would indicate that the stream has ended successfully.

DONE.
