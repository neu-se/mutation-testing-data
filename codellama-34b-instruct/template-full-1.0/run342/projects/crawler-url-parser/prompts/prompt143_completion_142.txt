  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.length
```
This would result in a different number of replacements than the original code, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in a different case for the replaced strings, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replaceAll(" ", "")
```
This would result in a different number of replaced characters, leading to different behavior.

DONE.
