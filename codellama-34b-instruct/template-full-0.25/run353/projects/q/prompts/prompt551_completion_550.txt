  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on the `result.value` object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not defined on the `result.value` object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is not defined on the `result.value` object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
