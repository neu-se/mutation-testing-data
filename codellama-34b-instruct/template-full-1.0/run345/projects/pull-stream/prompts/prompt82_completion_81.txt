  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `abort` and `cb` arguments, generating a new stack trace, whereas the original code fragment did not use any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read('abort')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the string `'abort'` as the first argument, unlike the original code fragment which passed the `abort` variable as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.throw()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `throw` method of the `read` function, which is not defined, generating an error, whereas the original code fragment did not attempt to call any methods on the `read` function.

DONE.
