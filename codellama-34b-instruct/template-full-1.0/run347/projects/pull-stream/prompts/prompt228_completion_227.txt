  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the boolean value of `data`, changing the outcome of the `test` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the `foo` property of the `data` object, which may not exist or have a different value than the original `data` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `test` function again, potentially changing the outcome of the filter.

DONE.
