  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method expects a number as an argument, but `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a string. This would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method expects a number as an argument, and `1` is a number. This would cause the method to return `true` if there is at least one more element in the iterator, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method expects a number as an argument, and `0` is a number. This would cause the method to return `false` if there are no more elements in the iterator, and `true` otherwise.
