  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is a function that is called for each property of the JSON object, while `options` is an options object that contains configuration for the `JSON.parse()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` expects a reviver function as its second argument, whereas `null` is not a function and will cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, "123"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"123"` is a string value and not a function, so it cannot be used as a reviver function for `JSON.parse()`.

DONE.
