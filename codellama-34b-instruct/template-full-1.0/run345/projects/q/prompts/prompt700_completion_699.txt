  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args + args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat` would concatenate the contents of `args` with another array, while `args + args` would concatenate the string representation of `args` with itself, resulting in a string that contains the stringified version of `args` twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` would concatenate the contents of `args` with another array, while `args.concat().reverse()` would concatenate the contents of `args` with another array and then reverse the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat` would concatenate the contents of `args` with another array, while `args.concat(args)` would concatenate the contents of `args` with a copy of itself.

DONE.
