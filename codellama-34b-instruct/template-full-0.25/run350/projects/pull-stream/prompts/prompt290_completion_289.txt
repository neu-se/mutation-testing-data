  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `field`, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the value of `field` to uppercase, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the value of `field`, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
