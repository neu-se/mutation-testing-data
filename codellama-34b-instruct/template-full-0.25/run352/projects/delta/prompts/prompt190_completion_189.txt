  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains the next n characters in the iterator, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the next n characters in the iterator, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that concatenates two iterators, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the iterator.

DONE.
