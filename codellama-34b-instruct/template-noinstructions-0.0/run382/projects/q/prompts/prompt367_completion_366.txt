  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that handles the fulfilled state of the promise, while `_rejected` is a function that handles the rejected state. Replacing `_rejected` with `_fulfilled` would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that handles the rejected state of the promise, and passing `null` as the exception would cause the promise to be rejected with a different exception than the one that was originally intended. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function
