  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the string at each slash character, while this code fragment splits it at each character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the string at each slash character, while this code fragment splits it at each space character and takes the first part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.match(/(\/[^\/]+)/)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the string at each slash character, while this code fragment uses a regular expression to match the first slash character and any characters that follow it up to the next slash character.

DONE.
