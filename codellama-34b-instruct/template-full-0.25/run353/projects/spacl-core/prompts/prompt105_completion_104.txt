  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to return a different value, potentially leading to a `null` reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to return a different value, potentially leading to a `null` reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to return a different value, potentially leading to a `null` reference error.

DONE.
