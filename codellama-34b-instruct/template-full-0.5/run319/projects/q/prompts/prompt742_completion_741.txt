  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function would be called, but the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.all` function would be called, but the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
