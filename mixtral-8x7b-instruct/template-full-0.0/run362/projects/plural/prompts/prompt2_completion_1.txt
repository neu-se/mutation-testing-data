 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different substring, changing the type string returned by the `type` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return 'object' instead of the expected type string, potentially causing incorrect behavior in the `plural` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used in the original code to explicitly specify the context of the `toString` method. Removing it would cause the `toString` method to be called without a specified context, potentially leading to different behavior.

DONE.
