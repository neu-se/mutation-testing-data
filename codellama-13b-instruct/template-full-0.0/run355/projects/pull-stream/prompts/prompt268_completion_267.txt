  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the data argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with both the data and null arguments. This could cause issues if the callback function is not designed to handle both arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the data argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with both the err and data arguments. This could cause issues if the callback function is not designed to handle both arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the data argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with both the null arguments.

DONE.
