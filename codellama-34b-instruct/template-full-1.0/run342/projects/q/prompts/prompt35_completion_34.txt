  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(1 + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `throw e` would throw an error, while the new code fragment `console.log(1 + 1)` would simply log the result of the addition operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null.toString();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `throw e` would throw an error, while the new code fragment `null.toString()` would cause a different error: a TypeError since null does not have a `toString` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `throw e` would throw an error, while the new code fragment `undefined()` would cause a syntax error since `undefined` is not a function.

DONE.
