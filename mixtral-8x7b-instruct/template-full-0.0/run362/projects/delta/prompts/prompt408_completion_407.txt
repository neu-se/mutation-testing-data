 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `chop` and `slice` have different functionalities. `chop` removes the last operation from the delta, while `slice` returns a new delta containing a subset of operations from the original delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain(1)` retains only one operation, while `chop` removes the last operation. This change would affect the overall behavior of the `transform` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.pop()
