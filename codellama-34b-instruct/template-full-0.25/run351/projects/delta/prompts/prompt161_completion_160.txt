  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to skip over the next operation in the other iterator, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to include an extra operation in the other iterator, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to include twice as many operations in the other iterator, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
