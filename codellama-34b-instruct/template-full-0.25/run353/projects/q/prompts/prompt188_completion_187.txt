  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concatenate stacks that have a line number greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] === attempt2[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concatenate stacks that have the same line number and column number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] !== attempt2[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concatenate stacks that have different line numbers or column numbers.

DONE.
