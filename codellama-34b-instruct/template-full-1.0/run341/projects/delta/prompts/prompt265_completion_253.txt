  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different method than `delete`, and it would change the delta object in a different way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a different method than `delete`, and it would combine two delta objects in a different way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).diff
```
This would result in different behavior because `diff` is a different method than `delete`, and it would compare two delta objects in a different way.

DONE.
