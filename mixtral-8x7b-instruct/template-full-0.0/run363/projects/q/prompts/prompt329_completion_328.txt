 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the promise, while this code resolves it. This change would bypass the error handling in the code and could lead to unexpected behavior if the error is not handled elsewhere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('This is a new error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the promise with the caught exception, while this code creates a new error object. This change would replace the original error message and stack trace with a new one, potentially making it harder to debug the issue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => reject(exception), 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the promise synchronously, while this code does it asynchronously. This change could lead to unexpected behavior if the error handling code relies on synchronous rejection.
