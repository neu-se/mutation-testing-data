  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function checks if the input is a glob pattern, and the original code fragment checks if the input is not a glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, so the code would enter the `if` block if the input is not a glob pattern, instead of entering the `else` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the input string contains the specified substring, and the original code fragment checks if the input is not a glob pattern.

DONE.
