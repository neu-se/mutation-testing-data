  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement would convert the word to uppercase before applying the pluralization rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement would return the length of the word instead of the pluralized form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement would reverse the order of the characters in the word before applying the pluralization rules.

DONE.
