   Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.values` returns the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property, while `object_keys` returns the object's own enumerable property names, including those originating from a prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.properties
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.properties` returns the object's own enumerable string-keyed property, while `object_keys` returns the object's own enumerable property names, including those originating from a prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` returns a method that checks if an object has a particular property name, which would affect the behavior of the code that relies on the existence of the `uncaughtException` property.

DONE.
