Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(elem => elem.insert ? 1 : 0).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic from summing the lengths of elements to counting the number of elements that have an `insert` property, which would yield a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((length, elem) => length + (elem.delete || 0), 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the reduction to only sum the `delete` properties of the elements, ignoring the `insert` properties, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the overall length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((length, elem) => length * 2, initialValue);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from addition to multiplication, which would drastically alter the final result, potentially leading to an incorrect length calculation.

DONE.
