  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the glob pattern, potentially causing the archive to be incomplete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first part of the glob pattern, potentially causing the archive to be incomplete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the glob pattern parts, potentially causing the archive to be incomplete.

DONE.
