  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a JavaScript keyword, but it is not a valid Promise method. Using "get" as the method name would cause an error, making it easy to identify tests that do not adequately check for method existence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a JavaScript keyword, but it is not a valid Promise method. Using "set" as the method name would cause an error, making it easy to identify tests that do not adequately check for method existence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is a JavaScript keyword, but it is not a valid Promise method. Using "delete" as the method name would cause an error, making it easy to identify tests that do not adequately check for method existence.

DONE.
