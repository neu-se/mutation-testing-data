  Option 1: The bugs are plentiful in this code, so we will use a web developer's two-favorite-words: 'off by one' errors. We will change the line
```2*b```

to
```Log2(b)+1```
since ```Log2()``` requires a positive integer as an argument. Many libraries will return ```NaN``` or ```-Infinity``` when the argument is less than or equal to 0.  Because the code utilizes an operator expecting numbers and the argument is now a string, this change will result in a bug.

Option 2: The bugs are plentiful in this code, so we will use a web developer's two-favorite-words: 'off by one' errors. We will change the line
```2*b```

to
```Math.round(b)```

All numbers' logarithm is either a natural number or zero; this change will result in a bug since b must be no larger than 1 so that its natural log is either 0 or 1.
