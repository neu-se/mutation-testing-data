  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing `undefined` as the second and third arguments to `then`, which means that the `onProgress` callback will not be called. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with the original code fragment, we are ensuring that the `onProgress` callback is called and that the promise is rejected if the progress notification is not received within the specified time frame.
