  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest(this.offset);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rest()` calls the `rest` method on the `this` object without any arguments, while this new code fragment calls the `rest` method on the `this` object with an argument of `this.offset`. The `rest` method is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it is not clear what it does or how it should be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest(this.index);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rest()` calls the `rest` method on the `this` object without any arguments, while this new code fragment calls the `rest` method on the `this` object with an argument of `this.index`. The `rest` method is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it is not clear what it does or how it should be called.
