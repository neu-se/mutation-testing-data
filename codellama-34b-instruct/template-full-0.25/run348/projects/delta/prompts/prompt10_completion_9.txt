  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `key` property of the `a` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `key` property of the `b` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the value of the `key` property of the `a` object to the value of the `key` property of the `b` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
