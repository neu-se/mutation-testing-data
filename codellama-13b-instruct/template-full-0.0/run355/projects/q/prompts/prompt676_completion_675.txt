  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `void 0` operator to return `undefined` as the first element of the array, while the buggy code fragment uses the `void` operator to return `undefined` as the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `void 0` operator to return `undefined` as the first element of the array, while the buggy code fragment does not include the `void 0` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `void 0` operator to return `undefined` as the first element of the array, while the buggy code fragment includes the `void 0` operator as the second element of the array.

DONE.
