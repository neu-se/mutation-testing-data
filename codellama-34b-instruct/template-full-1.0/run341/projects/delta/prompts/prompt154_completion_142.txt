  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > firstOther.retain - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` is a method that returns the length of the current op in the iterator, while `firstOther.retain - firstLeft` is the remaining length of the other op to be consumed. Replacing `thisIter.peekLength()` with `firstOther.retain - firstLeft` would cause the loop to iterate over the remaining ops of the other op, instead of the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` is a method that returns the type of the current op in the other iterator, while `thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'` is a condition that checks if the current op in the this iterator is an insert. Replacing `otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'` with `thisIter
