 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `cb` with a single argument of `null`, indicating no error. The modified code fragment calls `cb` with a single argument of `true`, indicating an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` using the `++` operator, which increments and returns the new value. The modified code fragment increments `i` using the `=` operator, which only sets the new value and does not return it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `cb` with a single argument of `null` or `i`, depending on the loop condition. The modified code fragment calls `cb` with the result of `Math.random()`, which is a random floating
