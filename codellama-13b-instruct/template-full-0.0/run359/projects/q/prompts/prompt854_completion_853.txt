  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function is called with the `timeoutId` variable, which is a reference to the timeout that was created in the `timeout` method. This would prevent the timeout from being triggered, and the promise would never be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function is called with the `timeoutId` variable plus one, which is a reference to a different timeout that was created in the `timeout` method. This would prevent the timeout from being triggered, and the promise would never be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function is called with the `timeoutId` variable minus one, which is a reference to a different timeout that was created in the `timeout`
