```
delta.remove(0)
```
This would result in the `concat` method being removed from the delta, which would have a different behavior than the original code because the method is used to concatenate two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(0)

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.change(0, 0, 'insert', 1)
```
This would result in the `concat` method being replaced with the `change` method, which would have a different behavior than the original code because the `change` method modifies the contents of
