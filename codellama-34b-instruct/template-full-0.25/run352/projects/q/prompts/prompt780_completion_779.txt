  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function that is called when the promise is rejected, while `regardless` is a function that is called regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfilled` is a function that is called when the promise is fulfilled, while `regardless` is a function that is called regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, while `regardless` is a function that is called regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
