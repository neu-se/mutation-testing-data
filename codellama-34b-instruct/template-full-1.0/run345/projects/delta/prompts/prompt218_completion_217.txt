  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would always return an empty `Delta` object, regardless of the input, because the slice operation would return an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would concatenate the `other` `Delta` object with the `this` `Delta` object, but without skipping the first character of the `other` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would concatenate the `other` `Delta` object with the `this` `Delta` object, but without skipping the first character of the `other` object if it exists.

DONE.
