  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.transform` is a different function from `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may not have the same behavior when inverting attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.compose
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.compose` is a different function from `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may not have the same behavior when inverting attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.diff` is a different function from `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may not have the same behavior when inverting attributes.

DONE.
