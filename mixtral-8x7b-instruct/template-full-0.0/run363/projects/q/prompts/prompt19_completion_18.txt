 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
qStartingLine = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the value assigned to `qStartingLine` is now a hard-coded integer instead of a marker for the line where Q starts. This could cause issues in stack traces and debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
qStartingLine = new Date();
```
This would result in different behavior because the value assigned to `qStartingLine` is now a Date object, which would not be equivalent to the original code fragment. This could cause issues in stack traces and debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
qStartingLine = "not a number";
```
This would result in different behavior because the value assigned to `qStartingLine` is now a string, which would not be equivalent to the original code fragment. This could cause issues in stack traces and debugging.

By changing the value of `qStartingLine
