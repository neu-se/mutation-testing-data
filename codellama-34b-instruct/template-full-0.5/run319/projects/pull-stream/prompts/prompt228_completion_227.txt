  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `data + 1` is not the same as `data`, and would cause the filter function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `data * 2` is not the same as `data`, and would cause the filter function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.length` is not the same as `data`, and would cause the filter function to return a different result.

DONE.
