  Sure. Here are three possible mutations to examine:
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "[this['re'], this['im']]"
```
This would produce different results since the entries are now keys in a JavaScript object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 return "(this['re'] * this['re'] + this['im'] * this['im'])"
```
This would produce a different result since it would output the length of the vector instead of the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 return "this['re'] + this['im'] * i"
```
This would produce a different result since it would omit the representation of the minus sign.
