 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2.0) * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an unnecessary multiplication by `Math.sqrt(2.0)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the second term in the denominator, which could affect the result significantly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(r * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a multiplication instead of a subtraction, which would lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
