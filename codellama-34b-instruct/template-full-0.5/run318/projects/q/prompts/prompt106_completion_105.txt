  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 1 instead of 0, which would skip the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from -1, which would cause an error because the array index must be a positive integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from Infinity, which would cause an error because the array index must be a finite integer.

DONE.
