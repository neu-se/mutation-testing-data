  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.W_OK` is the constant for write permission, while `fs.constants.R_OK` is the constant for read permission. Using `fs.constants.W_OK` would cause the code to check for write permission instead of read permission, which could lead to different results in the `access` method.

DONE.
