  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This change will cause the `zip` function to include the contents of the file specified by `globPart` in the zip archive, rather than the file itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(globPart, false)
```
This change will cause the `zip` function to include the contents of the directory specified by `globPart` in the zip archive, rather than the directory itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob(globPart)
```
This change will cause the `zip` function to include the contents of the files that match the glob pattern specified by `globPart` in the zip archive, rather than the files themselves.

DONE.
