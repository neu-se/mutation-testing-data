  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === qFileName
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the first element of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array is equal to `qFileName`, instead of checking if the entire array is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[1] === qStartingLine
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the second element of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array is equal to `qStartingLine`, instead of checking if the entire array is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array has a length of 0, instead of checking if the entire array is falsy.

DONE.
