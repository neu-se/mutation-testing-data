  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to always return 42, regardless of the inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to return the sum of `a` and `b`, instead of the natural logarithm of their hypotenuse.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to return the larger of `a` and `b`, instead of the natural logarithm of their hypotenuse.

DONE.
