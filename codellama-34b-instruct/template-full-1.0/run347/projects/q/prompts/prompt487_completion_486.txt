  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
reportedUnhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code also resets the `trackUnhandledRejections` flag to `true`, which this replacement does not do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code also resets the `unhandledRejections` array and the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which this replacement does not do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code also resets the `unhandledRejections` array and the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which this replacement does not do.

DONE.
