  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not call the callback function `cb` when the value is undefined, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the callback being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not call the callback function `cb` when the value is undefined, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the callback being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would call an empty function instead of the callback function `cb`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the callback being called.

DONE.
