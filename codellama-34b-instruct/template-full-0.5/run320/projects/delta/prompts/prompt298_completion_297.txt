  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate.call(this, line, attributes, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `predicate` function with the `line`, `attributes`, and `i` arguments, while this modified code calls the `predicate` function with the `this` context and the `line`, `attributes`, and `i` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate.apply(this, [line, attributes, i])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `predicate` function with the `line`, `attributes`, and `i` arguments, while this modified code calls the `predicate` function with the `this` context and an array containing the `line`, `attributes`, and `i` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate.bind(this, line, attributes, i)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `pred
