  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` function would be called when the promise is rejected, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` function would be called when the promise is fulfilled, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onProgress
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment, as it would call the `onProgress` function when the promise makes progress.

DONE.
