  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(s)
```
This would result in different behavior because the singular parameter 's' would be added to the word, regardless of the word's actual ending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match(w)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would try to match the entire word 'w' with the current matching rule, instead of just the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would replace the entire word 'w' with the string 'ves', instead of just the ending.

DONE.
