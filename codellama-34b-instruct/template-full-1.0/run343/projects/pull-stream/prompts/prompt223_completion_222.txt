  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tester"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "tester" is not a function and would cause an error when attempting to call it with the test data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tester
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` is applied to the `tester` variable, which is not a function and would result in a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(tester, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tester` variable is called with an additional argument `true`, which may change the behavior of the function if it was designed to handle such cases.

DONE.
