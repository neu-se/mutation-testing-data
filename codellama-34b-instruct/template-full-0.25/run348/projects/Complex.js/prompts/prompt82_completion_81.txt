  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking for the letter "j" or "J" instead of "i" or "I".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now only checking for the letter "I" instead of "i" or "I".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'i' || c === 'j'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking for the letter "i" or "j" instead of "i" or "I".

DONE.
