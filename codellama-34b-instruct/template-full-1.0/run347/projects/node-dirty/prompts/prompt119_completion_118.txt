  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- !this._queue.size
+ this._queue.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` operator is a negating operator, whereas `===` is a strict equality operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- !this._queue.size
+ !(this._queue.size > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `queue.size` is greater than 0, while this option would check if the `queue.size` is not less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- !this._queue.size
+ this._queue.size == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` is a loose equality operator, which may convert the operands before comparison.

DONE.
