  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with a data argument of 0, which is a falsy value, even if there was an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with a data argument of NaN, which is a special value that represents the result of a mathematical operation that cannot be represented in JavaScript, even if there was an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with a data argument of undefined, which is a falsy value, even if there was an error.

DONE.
