  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return next
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` is a function defined within the `filter` function, and replacing it with `return next` would cause the function to return a reference to itself, rather than executing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and replacing it with `return undefined` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of a function reference, which could potentially cause errors when the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and replacing it with `return null` would cause the function to return `null` instead of a function reference, which could potentially cause errors when the function is called.

DONE.
