  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onerror` handler would no longer be called, and any errors that occur would be silently ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() { return false; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onerror` handler would always return `false`, indicating that the error should be suppressed and not propagated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() { throw new Error("Dummy error"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onerror` handler would throw a new error, which would be propagated to the next error handler in the chain.

DONE.
