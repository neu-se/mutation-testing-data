  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset < index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'insert' and if the offset is less than the index or if priority is false, while this replacement checks if the next type is 'insert' and if the offset is less than the index or if priority is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset < index || priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'insert' and if the offset is less than the index or if priority is false, while this replacement checks if the next type is 'insert' and if the offset is less than the index or if priority is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset > index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks
