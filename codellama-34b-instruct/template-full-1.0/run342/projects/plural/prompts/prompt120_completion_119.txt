  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the input word to uppercase before returning it, while the original code fragment returns the word unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.split('s').join('') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the 's' character from the end of the input word before returning it, while the original code fragment assumes that the plural form of the word is always the original word followed by an 's' character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/, 'ic') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the 's' character from the end of the input word if it ends in 'ics', while the original code fragment assumes that the plural form of the word is always the original word followed by an 's'
