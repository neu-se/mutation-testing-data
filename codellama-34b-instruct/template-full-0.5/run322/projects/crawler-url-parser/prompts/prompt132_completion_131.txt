  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the replace method to replace all occurrences of the pattern in the string, instead of just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the replace method to ignore the case of the characters in the string, so the pattern would match regardless of whether the characters are uppercase or lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex would cause the replace method to treat the string as multiple lines, so the pattern would match the end of each line in the string, instead of just the end of the entire string.
