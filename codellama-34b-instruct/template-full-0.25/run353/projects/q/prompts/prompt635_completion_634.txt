  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `dispatch` method of `null`, whereas the original code would have thrown a `TypeError` when trying to access the `dispatch` method of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `dispatch` method of `undefined`, whereas the original code would have thrown a `TypeError` when trying to access the `dispatch` method of `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `dispatch` method of an empty object, whereas the original code would have thrown a `TypeError` when trying to access the `dispatch` method of `object`.

DONE.
