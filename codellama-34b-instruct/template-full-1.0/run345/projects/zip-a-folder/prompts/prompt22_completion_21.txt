  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions || !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `zipAFolderOptions` and `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` are truthy, while this new code fragment checks if either are falsy. If either `zipAFolderOptions` or `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` are falsy, the code will attempt to access `output`, which may not be defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions && !!zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `zipAFolderOptions` is truthy and `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `zipAFolderOptions` is truthy and `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` is truthy. If `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` is truthy, the code will attempt to
