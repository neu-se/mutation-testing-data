  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ /g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/ /g` matches any whitespace character, including spaces and tabs, whereas the original regular expression `/\n/g` only matches newline characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ /g, EOL + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/ /g` matches any whitespace character, including spaces and tabs, whereas the original regular expression `/\n/g` only matches newline characters. Additionally, the replacement string `EOL + ' '` adds an extra space character to the end of the string, whereas the original replacement string `EOL` does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ /g, EOL + ' ' + EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/ /g` matches any whitespace character, including spaces and tabs, whereas the original regular expression `/\n/g` only matches newline characters
