  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return <PLACEHOLDER>`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return <PLACEHOLDER>`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Test error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return <PLACEHOLDER>`.

DONE.
