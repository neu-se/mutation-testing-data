  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would reject the promise immediately, whereas `Q` is a promise library and would not have this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise and would not have the same properties and methods as `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` would resolve the promise immediately, whereas `Q` is a promise library and would not have this behavior.

DONE.
