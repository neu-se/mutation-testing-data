  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is a boolean value, and `err == true` will always evaluate to `true` if `err` is `true`, and `false` if `err` is `false`. However, the original code fragment `err === true` is checking for strict equality, which means it will only return `true` if `err` is strictly equal to `true`. This is a more strict check than `err == true` and would catch any cases where `err` is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, and it will invert the boolean value of `err`. If `err` is `true`, then `!err` will be `false`, and if `err` is `false`, then `!err` will be `true`. This is the opposite logic of the original code fragment `err === true`, which is checking for strict equality.
