  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(r-a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function is not defined for negative numbers, and `r-a` could be negative if `a` is greater than `r`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(r-a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exp` function is not defined for negative numbers, and `r-a` could be negative if `a` is greater than `r`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(r-a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is not defined for negative numbers, and `r-a` could be negative if `a` is greater than `r`.

DONE.
