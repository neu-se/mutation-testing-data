  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This change will cause the loop to start at the second element of the array instead of the first, which may cause the loop to skip over the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This change will cause the loop to start at the last element of the array instead of the first, which may cause the loop to skip over all the other elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)
```
This change will cause the loop to start at a random element of the array, which may cause the loop to skip over some elements or repeat others.

DONE.
