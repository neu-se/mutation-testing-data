  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `type.toLowerCase()` would return the lowercase version of the type string, which could potentially cause the test to fail if the expected result is a different case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `type.toUpperCase()` would return the uppercase version of the type string, which could potentially cause the test to fail if the expected result is a different case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `type.slice(1)` would return the type string without the first character, which could potentially cause the test to fail if the expected result is a different string.

DONE.
