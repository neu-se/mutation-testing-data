  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```incompatible-property-name```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is incorrect, causing the code to reference a non-existent property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (linkurl.subdomain.length != 0 && pageurl.subdomain.length == 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the subdomain is different, potentially causing the code to classify a link as internal when it should be external.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (linkurl.host === pageurl.host)
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the host is different, potentially causing the code to classify a link as external when it should be internal.

DONE.
