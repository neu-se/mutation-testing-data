  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the first `if` statement, which would return `Complex.NAN` for any input, regardless of whether it is infinite or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the second `if` statement, which would return `Complex.INFINITY` for any input, regardless of whether it is NaN or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'] && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the third `if` statement, which would return `Complex.ZERO` for any input, regardless of whether it is zero or not.

DONE.
