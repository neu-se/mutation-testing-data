 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the content as a string, even if it is a Buffer. The original code correctly checks if the content is a Buffer and converts it to a string if necessary.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the content as a Buffer, even if it is not. The original code correctly checks if the content is a Buffer and only converts it to a string if it is a Buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('ascii')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always convert the content to an ASCII string, even if a different encoding is specified. The original code correctly converts the content to a UTF-8 string if it is a Buffer.

DONE.
