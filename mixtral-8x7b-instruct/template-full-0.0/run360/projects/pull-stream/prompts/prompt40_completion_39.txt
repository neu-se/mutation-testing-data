 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pull.apply` call will throw a TypeError when trying to access the `null` value as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pull.apply` call will throw a TypeError when trying to access the `undefined` value as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pull.apply` call will treat the empty object as an array with a single element, which will change the behavior of the recursive call to `pull`.

DONE.
