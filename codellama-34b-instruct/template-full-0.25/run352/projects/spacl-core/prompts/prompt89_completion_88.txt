  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the array would be the same as the first element, rather than the policy object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the array would be null, rather than the policy object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name.toUpperCase()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the array would be the uppercase version of the policy name, rather than the policy object itself.

DONE.
