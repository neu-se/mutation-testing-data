  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp` is not the same as the last element in the `ops` array, which is what the original code fragment is doing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element in the `ops` array, regardless of whether it is the same as `newOp` or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length - 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the second-to-last element in the `ops` array, regardless of whether it is the same as `newOp` or not.

DONE.
