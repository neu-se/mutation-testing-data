  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a boolean value, whereas `abortCb` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a callback function, whereas `abortCb` is a function that takes an `abort` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a callback function, whereas `abortCb` is a function that takes an `abort` argument.

DONE.
