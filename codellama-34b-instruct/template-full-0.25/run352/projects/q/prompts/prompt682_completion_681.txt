  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with a different `this` value, which could affect the behavior of the function being applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with a different set of arguments, which could affect the behavior of the function being applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("call", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is called with a different set of arguments, which could affect the behavior of the function being applied.

DONE.
