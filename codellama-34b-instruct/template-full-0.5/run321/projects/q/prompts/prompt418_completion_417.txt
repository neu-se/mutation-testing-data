  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a promise inspection object, which has a `state` property that can be either "fulfilled", "rejected", or "pending". By checking if the state is "pending", we are effectively checking if the promise is still pending, and not fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because we are now checking if the promise is rejected, instead of pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because we are now checking if the promise is fulfilled, instead of pending.

DONE.
