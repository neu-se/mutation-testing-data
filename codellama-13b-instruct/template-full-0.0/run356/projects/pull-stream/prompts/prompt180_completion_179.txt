  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called with the `abort` and `onAbort` arguments, which would cause the callback to be called with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `true` argument, which would cause the callback to be called with a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `null` and `array[i++]` arguments, which would cause the callback to be called with a falsy value and the next element in the array.

DONE.
