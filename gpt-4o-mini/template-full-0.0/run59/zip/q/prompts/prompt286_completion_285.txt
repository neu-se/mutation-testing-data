Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `resolver` is `null`, allowing other non-function values (like strings or numbers) to pass through without throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolver === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `resolver` is an object, which would incorrectly allow functions (which are also objects in JavaScript) to pass the check, thus not throwing an error for non-function values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `resolver` is an instance of `Promise`, which would incorrectly allow any Promise instance to pass through, even if it is not a function, thus bypassing the intended validation.

DONE.
