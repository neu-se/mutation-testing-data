  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain !== 'object' || nextOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is an object and not null, while the new code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is not an object or null. If `nextOp.retain` is an object, the original code would return `false`, while the new code would return `true`. If `nextOp.retain` is not an object or is null, the original code would return `false`, while the new code would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is an object and not null, while the new code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number. If `nextOp.retain` is a number, the original code would return `false`, while the
