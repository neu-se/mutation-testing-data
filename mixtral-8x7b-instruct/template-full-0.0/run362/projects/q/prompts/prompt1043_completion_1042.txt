 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would immediately return `null` instead of resolving the promise with the head value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the entire promise object instead of resolving it with the head value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.head
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise` does not have a `head` property, causing an error and preventing the promise from being resolved.

DONE.
