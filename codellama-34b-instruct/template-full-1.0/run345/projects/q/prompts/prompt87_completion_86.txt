  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether `arguments[0] === f` and the new code is always evaluating to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_ => _
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether `arguments[0]` is a function, and the new code is always returning the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => call
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether `arguments[0]` is a function and the new code is always returning a new function.

DONE.
