  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(start - index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start - index + 1` expression would cause the `next` method to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different iteration order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(end - index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index - 1` expression would cause the `next` method to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different iteration order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(index - start + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index - start + 1` expression would cause the `next` method to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different iteration order.

DONE.
