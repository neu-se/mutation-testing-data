  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the current element and move to the next one, potentially missing a valid operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move to the previous element, potentially repeating the same operation multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move to the element at twice the current index, potentially skipping over valid operations.

DONE.
