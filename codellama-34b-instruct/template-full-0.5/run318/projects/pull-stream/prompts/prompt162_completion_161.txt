  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` when the `abort` argument is truthy, while the new code fragment returns `false` in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` when the `abort` argument is truthy, while the new code fragment returns `null` in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` when the `abort` argument is truthy, while the new code fragment returns `undefined` in all cases.

DONE.
