  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method would receive a `null` argument instead of an array of arguments, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method would receive an empty array instead of an array of arguments, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method would receive an array with different values instead of the original array of arguments, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
