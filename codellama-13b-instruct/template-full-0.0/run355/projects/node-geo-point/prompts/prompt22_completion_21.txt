  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has an own property called "latitude", whereas the original code fragment checks if the object has an own property called "longitude".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has an own property called "longitude", whereas the original code fragment checks if the object has an own property called "latitude".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has an own property called "type", whereas the original code fragment checks if the object has an own property called "latitude" or "longitude".

DONE.
