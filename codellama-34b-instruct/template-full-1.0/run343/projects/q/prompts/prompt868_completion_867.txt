  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would return a promise that is rejected with the given argument, while the `deferred.resolve` method would return a promise that is fulfilled with the given argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would return a promise that is notified with the given argument, while the `deferred.resolve` method would return a promise that is fulfilled with the given argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression evaluates to `undefined`, which is not a function and cannot be called like a function.

DONE.
