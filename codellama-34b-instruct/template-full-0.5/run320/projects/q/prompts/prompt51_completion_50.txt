  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that schedules the `flush` function to be called later, but calling `requestTick()` immediately would cause `flush` to be called immediately, rather than waiting for the next tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` schedules a function to be called after a delay, but the delay is set to 0, so the function would be called immediately, rather than waiting for the next tick.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` schedules a function to be called after I/O operations, but the function would be called immediately, rather than waiting for the next tick.

DONE.
