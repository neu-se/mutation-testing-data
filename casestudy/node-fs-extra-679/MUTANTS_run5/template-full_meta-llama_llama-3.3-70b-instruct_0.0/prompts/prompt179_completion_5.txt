Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent!== srcParent && destParent!== path.parse(destParent).root
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the original condition, causing the function to continue checking parent paths even when the destination parent is the same as the source parent or the root path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent === srcParent
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the check for the root path, potentially causing the function to stop checking parent paths prematurely if the destination parent is the root path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
srcParent === path.parse(srcParent).root
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to only check if the source parent is the root path, ignoring the relationship between the source and destination parents.

DONE.
