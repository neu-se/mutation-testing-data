  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `join` is a method that returns a new string by concatenating all the elements of an array, while `reduce` is a method that applies a function to each element of an array and returns a single value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in an array, while `reduce` is a method that applies a function to each element of an array and returns a single value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `reduce` is a method that applies a function to each element of an array and returns a single value.

DONE.
