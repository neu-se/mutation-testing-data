  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array that is the concatenation of the original array and the passed argument, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the `Promise` object, whereas `deferred` refers to the `Deferred` object that is passed to the `reject` method.

DONE.
