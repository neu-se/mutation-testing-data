  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl == "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the type of `linkurl` is a string, while this new code checks if `linkurl` is equal to the string "string".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `linkurl` is a string, while this new code checks if `linkurl` is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.includes("string")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `linkurl` is a string, while this new code checks if `linkurl` includes the substring "string".

DONE.
