  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, causing the while loop to continue indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, causing the while loop to never execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() || Math.random() < 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly return true or false, causing the while loop to sometimes execute and sometimes not.

DONE.
