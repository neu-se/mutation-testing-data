  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns the keys of an object, while the `values` method returns the values of an object. Using `values` instead of `keys` would cause the `Q.all` method to return the values of the resolved promises, rather than the keys of the resolved promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns the keys of an object, while the `length` property returns the length of an array. Using `length` instead of `keys` would cause the `Q.all` method to return the length of the resolved promises, rather than the keys of the resolved promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"concat"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns the keys of an object, while the `concat` method returns a new array that is the result of merging two
