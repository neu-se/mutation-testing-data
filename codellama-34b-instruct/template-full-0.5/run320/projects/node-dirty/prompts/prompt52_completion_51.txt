  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.get(key)` would return the value associated with the key, whereas `key` would return the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `key + 1` would return a different key than the original key, which could result in a different value being retrieved from the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.get(key) + 1` would return a different value than the original value associated with the key, which could result in unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
