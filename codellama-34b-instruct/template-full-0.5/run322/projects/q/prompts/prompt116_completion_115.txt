  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would start iterating from the second element of the array instead of the first, potentially skipping the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would start iterating from the last element of the array instead of the first, potentially causing the function to skip over the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would use the value of the element at the current index as the argument to the callback function, instead of the index itself.

DONE.
