Consider the following code fragment:
```
'use strict'
//a stream that errors immediately.
module.exports = function error (err) {
  return function (abort, cb) {
    cb(<PLACEHOLDER>)
  }
}


```

Please provide a code fragment that PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
