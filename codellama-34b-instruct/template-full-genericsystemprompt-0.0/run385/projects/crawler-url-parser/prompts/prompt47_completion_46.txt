  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `parsedUrl` object instead of the `parsedBaseUrl` object, which could lead to different results when formatting the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would parse the `baseUrlStr` string using the `URL.parse()` method, which could lead to different results when formatting the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would parse the `currentUrlStr` string using the `URL.parse()` method, which could lead to different results when formatting the URL.

DONE.
