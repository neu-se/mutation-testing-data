  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to the `read` function, which would cause the function to return early without reading any data from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the second argument to the `read` function, which would cause the function to return early without calling the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function would be passed as the second argument to the `read` function, which would cause the function to return early without calling the original callback function.

DONE.
