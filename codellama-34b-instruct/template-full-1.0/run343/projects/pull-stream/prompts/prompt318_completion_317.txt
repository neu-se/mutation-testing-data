  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a falsy value (null) to the callback function, which would result in a different execution path in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a truthy value (data) to the callback function, which would result in a different execution path in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, !data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the negated value of the data variable to the callback function, which would result in a different execution path in the code.

DONE.
