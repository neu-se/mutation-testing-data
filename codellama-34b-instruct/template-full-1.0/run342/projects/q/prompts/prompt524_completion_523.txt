  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using the `object` variable, the `null` value will be passed to the `dispatch` function, which would cause the function to return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using the `object` variable, the `undefined` value will be passed to the `dispatch` function, which would cause the function to return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"object"
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using the `object` variable, the string value "object" will be passed to the `dispatch` function, which would cause the function to return a rejected promise.

DONE.
