  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLine.substring(0,2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.prototype.substring()` expects two integers as arguments, whereas `String.prototype.charAt()` expects only one integer argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLine.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.prototype.charAt()` expects an integer as an argument, whereas `String.prototype.length` is a property that returns the length of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLine.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.prototype.charAt()` expects an integer as an argument, whereas `String.prototype.split()` returns an array of strings split at a given separator.

DONE.
