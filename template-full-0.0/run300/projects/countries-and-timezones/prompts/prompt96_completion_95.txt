  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` does not return a new array, while `map` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce((acc, cur) => acc.concat(cur), [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.

DONE.
