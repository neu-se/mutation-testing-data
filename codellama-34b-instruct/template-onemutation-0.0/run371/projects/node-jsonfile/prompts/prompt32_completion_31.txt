  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not always present in the `options` object, and when it is not present, the `stringify` function will use the default encoding, which may not be the same as the encoding used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
