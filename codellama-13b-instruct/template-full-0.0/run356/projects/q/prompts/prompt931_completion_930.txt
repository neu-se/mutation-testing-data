  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `apply` method to call `denodeify` with an array of arguments, while the buggy code fragment uses the `apply` method to call `denodeify` with a single argument. This could result in different behavior if the `denodeify` function has different behavior depending on the number of arguments it receives.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `apply` method to call `denodeify` with an array of arguments, while the buggy code fragment uses the `call` method to call `denodeify` with a single argument. This could result in different behavior if the `denodeify` function has different behavior depending on the number of arguments it receives.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This
