  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate to `true` only if both `abort` and `value` are truthy, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is truthy or if `value` is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `true` if either `abort` or `value` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` only if `abort` is truthy.

DONE.
