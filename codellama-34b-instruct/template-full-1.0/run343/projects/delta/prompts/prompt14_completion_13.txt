  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length === 0 ? undefined : attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would evaluate to `undefined` if the length of the `attributes` object is 0, whereas the original code would return the `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length > 0 ? attributes : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would evaluate to `attributes` if the length of the `attributes` object is greater than 0, whereas the original code would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length < 0 ? undefined : attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would evaluate to `undefined` if the length of the `attributes` object is less than 0, whereas the original code would return the `attributes` object.

DONE.
