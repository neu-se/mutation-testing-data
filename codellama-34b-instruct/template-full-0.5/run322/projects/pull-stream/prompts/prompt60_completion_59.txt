  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code fragment only passes one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read(abort)` would call the `read` function with the `abort` function as its argument, which is not the same as calling `read` with the `abort` variable as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read(true)` would call the `read` function with the boolean value `true` as its argument, which is not the same as calling `read` with the `abort` variable as its argument.

DONE.
