 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'criteria' as the plural of 'criterion', while this change would return 'criterions'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => 'criteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a function that takes a parameter 'w' (the word to be pluralized), but this change would ignore the word and always return 'criteria'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'criteria'.replace('a', 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'criteria' as the plural of 'criterion', but this change would return 'criterie'.

DONE.
