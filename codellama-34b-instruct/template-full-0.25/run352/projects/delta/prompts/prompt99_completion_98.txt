  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the second index of the `ops` array, rather than the first index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the `retain` property of the new operation, rather than the entire operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the `insert` property of the new operation, rather than the entire operation.

DONE.
