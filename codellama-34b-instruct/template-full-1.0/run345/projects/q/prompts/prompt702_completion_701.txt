  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_pop` returns the last element of an array, whereas `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array. The latter would cause the test to fail if the `object` parameter is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter(obj => !obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` returns an array containing the elements of `obj` that pass a truthy test, whereas `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array. The former would cause the test to fail if the `object` parameter is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_concat` returns an empty array if no arguments are provided, whereas `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array. The former would cause
