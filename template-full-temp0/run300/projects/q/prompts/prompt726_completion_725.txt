  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a rejected promise if any of the input promises are rejected, rather than waiting for all promises to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a pending promise if any of the input promises are pending, rather than waiting for all promises to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "fulfilled" && snapshot.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a fulfilled promise with a value of `undefined` if any of the input promises are fulfilled with a value of `undefined`, rather than waiting for all promises to be fulfilled with a non-`undefined` value.

DONE.
