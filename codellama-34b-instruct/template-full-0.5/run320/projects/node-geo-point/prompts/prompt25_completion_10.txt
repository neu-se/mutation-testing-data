  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be using the wrong property name to retrieve the longitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be retrieving the wrong longitude value, which could lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDistance` and `calculateBearing` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' + 'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be concatenating the latitude and longitude values, which would result in a string that would not be a valid property name.

DONE.
