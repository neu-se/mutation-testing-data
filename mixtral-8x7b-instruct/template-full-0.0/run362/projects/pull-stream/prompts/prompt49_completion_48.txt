 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = length; i--;
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an infinite loop, while the original code fragment iterates only a finite number of times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = '1'; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares a string to a number, which would always be false, causing the loop to not execute at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it resets the length of the 'ref' array to 0, causing the 'pull' function to not execute the expected number of times.

DONE.
