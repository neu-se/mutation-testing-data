 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` binding is not passed as the first argument to the `apply` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` binding is passed as the second argument instead of the first argument to the `apply` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` binding is set to the global object (or undefined in strict mode) instead of the expected value.

DONE.
