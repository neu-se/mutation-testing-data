 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `prev` is falsy, it will return an empty object instead of the original behavior of skipping that key-value pair in the resulting object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev
```
This would result in different behavior because if `prev` is falsy, it will omit that key-value pair in the resulting object, whereas the original code would still include it with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ id }
```
This would result in different behavior because it only includes the `id` property in the resulting object, whereas the original code includes the entire country object.

These changes introduce different behaviors that could expose potential issues in the test suite, providing a starting point for improving the test coverage and effectiveness.

DONE.
