  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `apply` method to call the `nbind` method, while the buggy code fragment uses the `apply` method to call the `nbind` method. This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call the `nbind` method, which is a method that is not defined in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `call` method to call the `nbind` method, while the buggy code fragment uses the `call` method to call the `nbind` method. This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to call the `nbind` method, which is a method that is not defined in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Q.nbind.
