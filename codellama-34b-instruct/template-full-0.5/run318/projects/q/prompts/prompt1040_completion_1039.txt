  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that returns a pending promise. In the original code, `ends.resolve` is called with a pending promise, which means that the promise is still pending and has not been resolved or rejected yet. By replacing `Q.defer` with `Q.reject`, we are returning a rejected promise instead, which means that the promise is already in a rejected state. This could cause issues with the rest of the code that expects the promise to be in a pending state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that returns a pending promise. In the original code, `ends.resolve` is called with a pending promise, which means that the promise is still pending and has not been resolved or rejected yet
