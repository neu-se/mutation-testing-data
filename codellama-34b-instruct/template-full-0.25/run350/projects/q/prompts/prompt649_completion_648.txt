  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the array is reversed, which could cause the `dispatch` method to interpret the arguments incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause it to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is being modified by adding 1 to it, which could cause the `dispatch` method to interpret the arguments incorrectly.

DONE.
