  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while the modified code fragment returns the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code fragment multiplies the imaginary part of the complex number by 2 before returning it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code fragment adds 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number before returning it.

DONE.
