  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `seen` object lookup, causing the filter to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `seen` object property to `false`, causing the filter to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the `seen` object property, causing the filter to return the opposite of what it should.

DONE.
