  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the coordinates is reversed, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that uses the resulting coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the coordinates together, which would change the resulting coordinates and potentially cause issues with the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the coordinates together, which would change the resulting coordinates and potentially cause issues with the rest of the code.

DONE.
