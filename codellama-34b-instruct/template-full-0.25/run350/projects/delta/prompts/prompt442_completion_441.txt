  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable is used to calculate the length of the next operation, and adding 1 to it would cause the length to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to calculate the length of the next operation, and subtracting the `offset` from it would cause the length to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to calculate the length of the next operation, and adding the `offset` to it would cause the length to be incorrect.

DONE.
