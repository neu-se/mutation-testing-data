Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to receive `null` instead of the actual attributes, potentially leading to incorrect attribute handling or errors during the inversion process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty object to the `AttributeMap.invert` function, which may not represent the intended attributes and could lead to unexpected results in the inversion logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `insert` property of `baseOp` instead of its `attributes`, which could disrupt the expected attribute mapping and lead to incorrect transformations or inversions.

DONE.
