  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of an array, whereas `delete` removes a specific element from an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `delete` removes a specific element from an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from an array, whereas `delete` removes a specific element from an array.

DONE.
