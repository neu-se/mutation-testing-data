 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0 && z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for real and imaginary parts being zero, instead of checking if the complex number is zero using the `isZero()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the current complex number's real and imaginary parts being zero, rather than checking if the divisor complex number is zero using the `isZero()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `Complex['ONE']` regardless of the input, bypassing the actual calculation.

DONE.
