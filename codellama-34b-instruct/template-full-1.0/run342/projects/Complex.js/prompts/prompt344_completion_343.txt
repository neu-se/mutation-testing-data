  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is always positive, whereas `b` may be negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b - 1` is always negative, whereas `b` may be positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 * b` is always twice the value of `b`, whereas `b` may have any value.

DONE.
