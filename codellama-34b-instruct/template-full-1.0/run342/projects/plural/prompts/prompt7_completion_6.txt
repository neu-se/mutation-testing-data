  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.add
```
This would result in different behavior because `add` is a property of the `Array` prototype, and using it instead of `unshift` would cause the new rule to be added to the end of the `rules` array instead of the beginning. This could cause the new rule to be applied after all the existing rules and potentially change the output of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a property of the `Array` prototype, and using it instead of `unshift` would cause the new rule to be added to the end of the `rules` array instead of the beginning. This could cause the new rule to be applied after all the existing rules and potentially change the output of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a property of the `Array` prototype, and using it
