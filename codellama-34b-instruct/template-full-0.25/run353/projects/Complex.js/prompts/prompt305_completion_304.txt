  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function, which is different from the `sinh` function used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, which is different from the `sinh` function used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `sqrt` is the square root function, which is different from the `sinh` function used in the original code.

DONE.
