  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(word, 2)
```
This would result in the plural form of words being returned, even if the count is not plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(word, 1)
```
This would result in the singular form of words being returned, even if the count is plural.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(word, num + 1)
```
This would result in the plural form of words being returned, with the additional behavior of increasing the count by 1.

DONE.
