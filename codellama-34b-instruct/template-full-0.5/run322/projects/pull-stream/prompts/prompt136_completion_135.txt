  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an error object, but `null` is not an error object and would not cause the `cb` function to be called with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an error object, but `undefined` is not an error object and would not cause the `cb` function to be called with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an error object, but `0` is not an error object and would not cause the `cb` function to be called with an error.

DONE.
