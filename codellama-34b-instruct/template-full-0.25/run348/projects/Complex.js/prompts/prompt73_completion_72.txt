  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with a non-zero argument, which would cause the program to exit with an error code of 1, rather than the default behavior of exiting with a code of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with a zero argument, which would cause the program to exit with a success code of 0, rather than the default behavior of exiting with an error code of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with an argument of 2, which would cause the program to exit with an error code of 2, rather than the default behavior of exiting with an error code of 1.
