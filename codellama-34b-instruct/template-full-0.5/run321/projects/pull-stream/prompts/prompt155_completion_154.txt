  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, null, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb, abort, onAbort` passes the `abort` argument as the second argument to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment `cb, null, onAbort` passes `null` as the second argument. This could cause the `cb` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb, abort, onAbort` passes the `onAbort` argument as the third argument to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment `cb, abort, null` passes `null` as the third argument. This could cause the `cb` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort()
```
This would result
