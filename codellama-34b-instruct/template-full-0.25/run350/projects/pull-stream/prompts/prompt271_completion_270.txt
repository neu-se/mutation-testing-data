  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.values` would return an array of values, whereas `values` would return a single value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.value` would return a single value, whereas `values` would return an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.map(function(x) { return x.value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.map` would apply the function to each element of the stream, whereas `values` would return an array of values.

DONE.
