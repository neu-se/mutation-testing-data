 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(attributes).length > 0 ? attributes : {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator now returns an empty object `{}` when `attributes` is empty, instead of returning `null`. This change may affect the logic that relies on `attributes` being explicitly `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
attributes || {};
