  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes two arguments, `op` and `index`, and returns the result of calling the `predicate` function with those arguments. However, the new code fragment is a function that takes a single argument, `op`, and returns a new function that takes a single argument, `index`, and returns the result of calling the `predicate` function with the original `op` and `index` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes two arguments, `op` and `index`, and returns the result of calling the `predicate` function with those arguments. However, the new code fragment is a function that takes a single argument, `op`, and returns the result of calling the `predicate` function with the original `op` and `index` arguments.
