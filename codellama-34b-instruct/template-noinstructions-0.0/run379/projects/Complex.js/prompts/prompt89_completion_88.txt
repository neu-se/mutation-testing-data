  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would parse the next token as a float, whereas the original code fragment would parse the entire string as a float.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the next token as a string, whereas the original code fragment would parse the entire string as a float.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] * 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the next token by 1, whereas the original code fragment would parse the entire string as a float.

DONE.
