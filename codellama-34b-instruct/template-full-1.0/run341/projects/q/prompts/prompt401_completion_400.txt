  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve instantly with a null value, rather than waiting for the promise to resolve with the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(async () => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve instantly with a value of `undefined`, rather than waiting for the promise to resolve with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(() => null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve instantly with a value of `null`, rather than waiting for the promise to resolve with the original value.

DONE.
