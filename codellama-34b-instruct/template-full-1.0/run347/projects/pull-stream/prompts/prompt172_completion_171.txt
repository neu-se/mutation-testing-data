  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.isArray()` method returns `true` if the passed argument is an array, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, the negation operator `!` is used to convert the return value to a boolean, which has the effect of making the function return `true` if `array` is not an array, and `false` otherwise. By replacing `!Array.isArray(array)` with `Array.isArray(array)`, the function will return `false` if `array` is not an array, and `true` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks whether `array` is an instance of the `Array` class, regardless of its content. In the original code, the `Array.isArray()` method checks both whether `array` is an array and whether it has at least one element. By replacing `!Array.
