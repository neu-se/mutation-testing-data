  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.x.
```
This would result in different behavior because there is no property "x" on the Q object, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a different value, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(result.value).then(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional then() call to the promise, which could potentially change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
