  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is not equal to 0 and `b` is equal to 0, which would cause the function to enter the `if` block even if only `b` is equal to 0, and the output would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is equal to 0 or `b` is equal to 0, which would cause the function to enter the `if` block if either `a` or `b` is equal to 0, and the output would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0 && b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is not equal to 0 and `b` is not equal to 0,
