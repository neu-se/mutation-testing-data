Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat `nextOp.insert` as valid when it is a number, leading to potential errors when trying to access string methods like `substr`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to incorrectly assume that `nextOp.insert` is valid when it is actually `null`, potentially leading to runtime errors when trying to call `substr` on `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to proceed with an empty string (if `nextOp.insert` is an empty string), which would not be the intended behavior of checking if `nextOp.insert` is a string type.

DONE.
