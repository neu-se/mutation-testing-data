Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current index instead of the length of the next operation, potentially causing `hasNext()` to return `true` even when there are no more operations left.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the offset plus one is less than Infinity, which would always be true, leading to `hasNext()` always returning `true` regardless of the actual number of operations remaining.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length of the operations array to Infinity, which would always be true, causing `hasNext()` to incorrectly indicate that there are always more operations available.

DONE.
