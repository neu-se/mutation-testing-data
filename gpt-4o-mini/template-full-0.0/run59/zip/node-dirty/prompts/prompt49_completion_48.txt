Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the current value instead of applying the updater function, which may lead to incorrect data being stored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to `null` instead of applying the updater function, which would overwrite the existing value with `null` regardless of the intended update.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the current value by 2 instead of applying the updater function, which could lead to unintended data changes if the updater was meant to modify the value in a specific way.

DONE.
