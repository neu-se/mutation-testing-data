  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable, while `data + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable, while `data.length` is a property of the variable that represents the length of the variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable, while `mapper(data)` is a function call that applies the `mapper` function to the value of `data`.

DONE.
