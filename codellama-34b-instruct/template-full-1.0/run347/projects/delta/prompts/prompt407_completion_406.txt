  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler` is an object with nested properties, and `handler[0]` would access the first property of the object, which may not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.method()
```
This would result in different behavior because `method()` is a different method than the original `handler` method, and may have different side effects or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.property = true
```
This would result in different behavior because `property` may have a different value than the original `handler` property, which could affect the behavior of the code that follows.

DONE.
