  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a property of the `op` object, and it is not a function. In the original code, `op` is a function, and it is being called with the `delete` operator. Replacing `op` with `op.delete` would result in a different behavior because it would be trying to call a property as a function, which would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a property of the `op` object, and it is not a function. In the original code, `op` is a function, and it is being called with the `retain` operator. Replacing `op` with `op.retain` would result in a different behavior because it would be trying to call a property as a function, which would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced
