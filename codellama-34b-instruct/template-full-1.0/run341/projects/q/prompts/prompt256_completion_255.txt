  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return, instead of resolving or rejecting the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would negate the result of the resolved promise, instead of resolving or rejecting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the value 3, without considering the resolved promise.

DONE.
