  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) return cb(err);
  acc = reducer(acc, data);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` function with a different callback function, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) return cb(err);
  acc = reducer(acc, data);
  cb(null, acc);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a different value for the `acc` parameter, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) return cb(err);
  acc = reducer(acc, data
