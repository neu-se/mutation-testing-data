  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!values
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would return the opposite of the boolean value of `values`. If `values` is an array, this would return the negation of the array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array containing the elements of the original array from the specified index (1 in this case) to the end. If `values` is an array with elements 1, 2, 3, this would return the array [2, 3], which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values[0] + values[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the concatenation of the first two elements of `values`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
