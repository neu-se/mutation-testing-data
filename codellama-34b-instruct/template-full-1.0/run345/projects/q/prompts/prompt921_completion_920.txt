  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fin(deferred.resolve).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fin` is not the same function as `fail`,
so the returned promise would not handle rejections in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.resolve).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` would be called twice,
with the same nodeback, which would not have the desired effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail("Error").fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` would be called with "Error"
as an argument, which would not have the desired effect.

DONE.
