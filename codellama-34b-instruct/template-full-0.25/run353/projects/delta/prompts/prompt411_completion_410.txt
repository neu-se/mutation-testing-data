  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether there are more elements in the iterator, whereas `hasNext` is a property that refers to the next element in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` is a method that returns the next element in the iterator and advances the iterator, whereas `next` is a property that refers to the next element in the iterator without advancing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` is a method that returns the next element in the iterator without advancing it, whereas `peek` is a property that refers to the next element in the iterator and advances it.

DONE.
