  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, while `deferred.resolve` would resolve it, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, while `deferred.notify` would notify the promise, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` would create a new node resolver, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

DONE.
