  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be performed on the `Q` object, rather than the `object` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` operation would be performed on the `Q` object, rather than the `object` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation would be performed on the `Q` object, rather than the `object` object.

DONE.
