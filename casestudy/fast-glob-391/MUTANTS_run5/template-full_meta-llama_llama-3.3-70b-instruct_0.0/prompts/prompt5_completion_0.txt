Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
utils.pattern.convertPatternsToRe(negative, this._micromatchOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it does not set `dot` to `true` in the `micromatchOptions`, which could affect how patterns are matched.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
utils.path.makeAbsolute
```
This would result in different behavior because `utils.path.makeAbsolute` is used for making absolute paths, not for converting patterns to regex, which would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => negative
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the original `negative` array instead of converting it to regex patterns, which would cause incorrect filtering behavior.

DONE.
