  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the deferred resolver function to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, while this code fragment pushes the resolver function to the end of the `nodeArgs` array twice. This would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have an extra element, which could potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the deferred resolver function to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, while this code fragment pushes the resolver function to the beginning of the `nodeArgs` array. This would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different order of elements, which could potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
