  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$x
```
This would result in different behavior because $x is always null, whereas b might be a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 is always falsey, whereas b might be truthy or falsey depending on its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is always falsey, whereas b might be truthy or falsey depending on its value.

DONE.
