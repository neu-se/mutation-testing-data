  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `spec` parameter is a string, but the `compile` function expects an object with a `spec` property that is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec, '1.0')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is being called with a different version number. The `version` parameter is used to determine which specification language version to use, and the `spec` parameter is used to determine which specification language to use.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec, '1.1')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is being called with a different version number. The `version` parameter is used to determine which specification language version to use
