  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons` is an array of reasons for unhandled rejections, while `unhandledRejections` is an array of unhandled rejection promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` is an array of unhandled rejection promises that have been reported, while `unhandledRejections` is an array of all unhandled rejection promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would not contain any unhandled rejection promises, while `unhandledRejections` is an array of all unhandled rejection promises.

DONE.
