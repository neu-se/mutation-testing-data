  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "get" method is used to retrieve the value of a property, whereas the "post" method is used to set the value of a property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "set" method is used to set the value of a property, whereas the "post" method is used to retrieve the value of a property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "delete" method is used to delete a property, whereas the "post" method is used to set the value of a property.

DONE.
