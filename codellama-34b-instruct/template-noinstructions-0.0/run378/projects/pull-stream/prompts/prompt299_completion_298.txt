  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `ended` variable is true, but the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would be called regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `ended` variable is true, but the new code fragment `cb(ended, data)` would be called with a different value for the `ended` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `ended` variable is true, but the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would be called regardless of the value of `ended`.

DONE.
