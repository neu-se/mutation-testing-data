  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `undefined`, and would be treated as a rejection reason in the `fail` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a distinct value from `null`, and would be treated as a rejection reason in the `fail` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a distinct value from `undefined`, and would be treated as a rejection reason in the `fail` method.

DONE.
