  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, baseUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `gettype` function with `baseUrl` instead of `pageUrl`, which would change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, bolobar.pageUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a non-existent variable `bolobar` as an argument to the `gettype` function, which would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value to the `gettype` function instead of a valid `baseUrl`, which could cause the function to return a different result or throw an error.

DONE.
