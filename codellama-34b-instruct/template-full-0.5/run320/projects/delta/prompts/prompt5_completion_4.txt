  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull && attributes[key] != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the attribute value is not null, which is not the case in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull || attributes[key] != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either the keepNull flag is not true or the attribute value is not null, which is not the case in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull && attributes[key] == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the keepNull flag is not true and the attribute value is null, which is not the case in the original code fragment.

DONE.
