  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is already defined in the code, and calling it again would cause an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that takes no arguments, and passing an argument would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is called with a specific context (the `this` value), and calling it with a different context would cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
