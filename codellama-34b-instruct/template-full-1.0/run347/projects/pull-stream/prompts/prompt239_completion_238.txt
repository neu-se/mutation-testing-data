  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `!cb` is the logical NOT of the value of `cb`, which means that `!cb` is only true when `cb` is false, whereas the original code fragment `cb` is always true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && data
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb && data` is true only when both `cb` and `data` are true, whereas the original code fragment `cb` is always true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb === 'function' && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof cb === 'function'` checks if `cb` is a function, and only if it is true, `cb()` is called. The original code fragment, on the other hand, checks if `cb` is false, and only if it is false, `cb()` is called.

DONE.
