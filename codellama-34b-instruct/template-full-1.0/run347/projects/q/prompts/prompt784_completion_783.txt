  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) {
    throw new Error("Testing 123");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) {
    error.message = "Testing 123";
    throw error;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the error would be thrown with a modified message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) {
    throw new Error("Testing 123", { cause: error });
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the original error would be included as the cause of the new error.

DONE.
