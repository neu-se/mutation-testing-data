  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `format` variable as the first argument to the `archiver` function, while this alternative code fragment passes a `null` value instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, { gzip: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes an empty object `{}` as the second argument to the `archiver` function, while this alternative code fragment passes an object with the `gzip` property set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
size, archiverOptions || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `format` variable as the first argument to the `archiver` function, while this alternative code fragment uses a different variable `size` instead. Additionally, this alternative code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||` to provide a default value for the `archiverOptions` parameter, which
