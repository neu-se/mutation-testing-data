  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds 's' to the end of the word and then adds 's' again, resulting in 'criterions' instead of 'criteria'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment does not add any letters to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteria', 'criteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment does not add any letters to the end of the word.

DONE.
