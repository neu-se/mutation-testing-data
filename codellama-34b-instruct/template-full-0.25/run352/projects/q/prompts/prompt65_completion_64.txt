  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to throw an error, which would prevent the `setImmediate` function from being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to be called after a delay of 1 second, rather than immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to be called immediately, rather than after a delay.

DONE.
