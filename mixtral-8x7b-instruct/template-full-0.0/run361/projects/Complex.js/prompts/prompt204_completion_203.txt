 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the instance property `im` instead of the parameter `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0 for the imaginary part of the result, regardless of the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
