 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.push([match, result])
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of rules will be reversed, potentially causing incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules[0] = [match, result]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first rule added will overwrite the existing rule, potentially changing the behavior of the plural function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
var newRules = []
newRules.unshift([match, result])
rules = newRules
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array for rules and assigns it to the rules variable, potentially causing other parts of the code that reference the rules array to behave incorrectly.

DONE.
