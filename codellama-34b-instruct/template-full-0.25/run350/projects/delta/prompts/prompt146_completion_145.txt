  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to always return the first element, even if the index is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to always return the next element, even if the index is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to always return the previous element, even if the index is greater than 0.

DONE.
