  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would return `true` for `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a different value than `object`, and the `isObject` function would return `false` for `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `object`, and the `isObject` function would return `false` for `0`.

DONE.
