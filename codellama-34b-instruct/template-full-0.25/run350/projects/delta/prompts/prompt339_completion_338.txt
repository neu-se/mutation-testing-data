  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the base index by 2 instead of 1, which could cause the slice function to return a different range of elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the base index by 1 instead of incrementing it, which could cause the slice function to return a different range of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the base index by 2 instead of incrementing it, which could cause the slice function to return a different range of elements.

DONE.
