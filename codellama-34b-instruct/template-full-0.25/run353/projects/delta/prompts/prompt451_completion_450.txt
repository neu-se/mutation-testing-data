  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method returns a boolean indicating whether there are more elements in the iterator, whereas `!this.hasNext()` returns the negation of that boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.index` is the current index of the iterator, and `this.ops.length` is the length of the `ops` array. If the iterator has not reached the end of the array, `this.index < this.ops.length` would return `true`, whereas `!this.hasNext()` would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peek() !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.peek()` returns the next element in the iterator, and `undefined` is returned if there are no more elements. If there are more elements,
