  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/^\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of `/index.[a-z]+$` with `/`, while the new code fragment replaces both the first and second occurrences.
