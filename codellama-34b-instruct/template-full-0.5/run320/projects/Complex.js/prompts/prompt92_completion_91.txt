  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, while this new code fragment is adding 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + 'NaN'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding a number to the imaginary part of the complex number, while this new code fragment is adding a non-numeric value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + 'Infinity'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding a finite number to the imaginary part of the complex number, while this new code fragment is adding an infinite value.

DONE.
