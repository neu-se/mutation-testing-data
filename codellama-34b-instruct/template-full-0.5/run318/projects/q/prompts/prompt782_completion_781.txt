  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` is not a function, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(promise.inspect)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` is not a function, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return promise.inspect(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the wrong `this` value, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
