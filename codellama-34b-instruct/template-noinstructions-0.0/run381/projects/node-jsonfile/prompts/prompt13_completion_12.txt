  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

DONE.
