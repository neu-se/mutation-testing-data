  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.toTile(zoom - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method is called with a different zoom level, which could affect the resulting tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.toTile(zoom + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method is called with a different zoom level, which could affect the resulting tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.toTile(zoom + 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method is called with a different zoom level, which could affect the resulting tile coordinates.

DONE.
