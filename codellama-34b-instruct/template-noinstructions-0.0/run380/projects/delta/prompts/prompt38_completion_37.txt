  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first argument, regardless of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, regardless of the values of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return undefined, regardless of the values of the arguments.

DONE.
