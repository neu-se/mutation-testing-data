  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would pass the resolved value to the next promise, while `null` would pass `null` to the next promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would pass the resolved value to the next promise, while `undefined` would pass `undefined` to the next promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would pass the resolved value to the next promise, while `0` would pass `0` to the next promise.

DONE.
