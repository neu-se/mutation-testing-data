  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `attributes` property in both `newOp` and `lastOp`, while the modified code only checks for the presence of the `attributes` property in `newOp`. If `lastOp` has an `attributes` property but `newOp` does not, the modified code would return `true`, while the original code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `attributes` property in both `newOp` and `lastOp`, while the modified code only checks for the presence of the `attributes` property in `newOp`. If `lastOp` has an `attributes` property but `newOp` does not, the modified code would return `false`, while the original code would return `true`.
