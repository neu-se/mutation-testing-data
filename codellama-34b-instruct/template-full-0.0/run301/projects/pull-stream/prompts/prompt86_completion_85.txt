  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(abort, cb) || function () {}`, which would always return a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a lower precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `abort || (cb, function () {})`, which would always return `abort` if it is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(abort && cb) || function () {}`, which would always return `cb` if `abort` is truthy.
