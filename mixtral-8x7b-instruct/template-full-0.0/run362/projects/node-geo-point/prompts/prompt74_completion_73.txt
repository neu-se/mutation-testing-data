 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * deg2rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an unnecessary multiplication operation, which would not affect the calculation result but could potentially cause issues if the multiplication operator has a different precedence in the codebase or introduces performance overhead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(Math.sin(coordinate.latitude) * Math.cos(distance / radius) + Math.cos(coordinate.latitude) * Math.sin(distance / radius) * Math.cos(θ))
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `deg2rad` function with a more complex expression that calculates the arcsine of a trigonometric expression. This change would not provide the correct angular distance in radians, affecting the accuracy of the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(Math.sin(θ) *
