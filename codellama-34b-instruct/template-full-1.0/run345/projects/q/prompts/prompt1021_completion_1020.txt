  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["foo", nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is now hardcoded to `"foo"` instead of being determined by the `name` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.concat("bar")]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array is now modified to include an additional `"bar"` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, [].concat(nodeArgs)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array is now copied instead of passed by reference.

DONE.
