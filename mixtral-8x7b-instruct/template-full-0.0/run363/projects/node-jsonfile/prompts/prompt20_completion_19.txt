 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the `options` argument from `readFileSync` function. Instead of passing the options object to `fs.readFileSync`, it would pass an empty object, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the `options` argument from `readFileSync` function. Instead of passing the options object to `fs.readFileSync`, it would pass `null`, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the `options` argument from `readFileSync` function. Instead of passing the `options` object to `fs.readFileSync`, it would pass the global object (`window` in a browser or `global` in Node.js), potentially causing unexpected behavior.
