  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is greater than 0, while this replacement checks if the index is less than 0. This would cause the code to behave differently for indexes that are less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is greater than 0, while this replacement checks if the index is equal to 0. This would cause the code to behave differently for indexes that are equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is greater than 0, while this replacement checks if the index is not equal to 0. This would cause the code to behave differently for indexes that are not equal to 0.

DONE.
