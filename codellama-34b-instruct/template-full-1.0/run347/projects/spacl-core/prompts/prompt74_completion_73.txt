  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return `false` if the result of `rule.query` is `null`, but the new code fragment would return `true` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!res
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return `true` if the result of `rule.query` is `false`, but the new code fragment would return `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return `false` if the result of `rule.query` is not `false`, but the new code fragment would return `true` in those cases.

DONE.
