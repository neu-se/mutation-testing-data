 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.destroy;
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.destroy` is a function to destroy the incoming message. Unlike `res.pipe`, it doesn't pipe the response to a writable stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createWriteStream;
