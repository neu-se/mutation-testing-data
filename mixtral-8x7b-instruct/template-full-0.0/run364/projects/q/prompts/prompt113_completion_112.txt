 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `.apply` allows for passing in an array of arguments, whereas `.call` expects individual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `.bind` creates a new function with the specified `this` value and initial arguments, whereas `.call` invokes the function with the provided `this` value and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.toString()` returns a string representation of the function, rather than invoking it.

DONE.
