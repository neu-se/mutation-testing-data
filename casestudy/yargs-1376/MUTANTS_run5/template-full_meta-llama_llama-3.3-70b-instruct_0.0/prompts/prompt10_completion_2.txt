Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defaultConfig
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking if `defaultConfig` has an 'extends' property instead of `config`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the 'extends' property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
config(extends)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be trying to call `config` as a function with the argument 'extends', which would likely throw an error since `config` is expected to be an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking if the current context (`this`) has an 'extends' property, which could have unintended consequences depending on the context in which `applyExtends` is called.

DONE.
