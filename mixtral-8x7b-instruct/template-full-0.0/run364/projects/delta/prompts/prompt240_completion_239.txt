 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the length of the first operation in the iterator instead of checking the length of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the total number of operations in the iterator instead of the length of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because it always assigns a constant value of 10 to the `opLength` variable, regardless of the length of the next operation in the iterator.

DONE.
