  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- name
+ path
```
This would result in different behavior because `path` is not the same as `name` and would cause the method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- name
+ "example_name"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"example_name"` is not the same as the variable `name` and would cause the method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- name
+ this.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.name` is not the same as `name` and would cause the method to fail.

DONE.
