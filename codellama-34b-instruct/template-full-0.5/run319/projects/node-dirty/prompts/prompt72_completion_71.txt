  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different value for the `load` event, which is used to report the number of keys in the database after loading.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different value for the `load` event, which is used to report the number of keys in the database after loading.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different value for the `load` event, which is used to report the number of keys in the database after loading.

DONE.
