  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start one element later in the array, potentially skipping the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start one element earlier in the array, potentially repeating the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start two elements later in the array, potentially skipping the first two elements.

DONE.
