  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` variable would be incremented, which could affect the results of the `getCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` variable would be decremented, which could also affect the results of the `getCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` variable would be multiplied by 2, which could also affect the results of the `getCountry` function.

DONE.
