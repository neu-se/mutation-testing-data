  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function, while `universalify.fromCallback` expects a callback-based function. Using `fs.readFileSync` would cause the program to block until the file is read, rather than returning a promise that can be resolved later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that takes a callback function as its last argument, while `universalify.fromCallback` expects a function that takes a callback function as its first argument. Using `fs.readFile` would cause the program to pass the callback function as the last argument, rather than the first argument, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.read
