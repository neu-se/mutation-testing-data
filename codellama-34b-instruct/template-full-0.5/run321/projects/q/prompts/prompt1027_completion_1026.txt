  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `nodeback`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if a nodeback function is provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `nodeback`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if no nodeback function is provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and attempting to call it as a function would cause an error to be thrown, even if a nodeback function is provided.

DONE.
