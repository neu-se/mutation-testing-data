  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, whereas `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if a complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, whereas `isNaN` checks if a complex number is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if a complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, whereas `isNaN` checks if a complex number is not a number.

DONE.
