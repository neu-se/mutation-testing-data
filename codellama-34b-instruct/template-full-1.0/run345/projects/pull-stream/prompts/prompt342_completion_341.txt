  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in always executing the `cb` function, regardless of the value of `abort`, because the negation operator `!` inverts the value of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && cb
```
This would result in only executing the `cb` function if `abort` is truthy, because the `&&` operator evaluates the second operand only if the first operand is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (abort) return;
```
This would result in skipping the execution of the `cb` function if `abort` is truthy, because the `if` statement evaluates the condition and executes the block of code only if the condition is truthy.

DONE.
