  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method starts at the second element (with the index of 1) in the ops array, whereas the original code starts at the first element (with the index of 0).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method starts at the last element (with the index of -1) in the ops array, whereas the original code starts at the first element (with the index of 0).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(null)
```
This would result in a TypeError because the slice method expects a number or a string for its first argument, but null is neither.

DONE.
