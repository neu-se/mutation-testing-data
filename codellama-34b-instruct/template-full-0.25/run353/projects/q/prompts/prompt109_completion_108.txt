  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= this.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < this.length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop at the second-to-last element in the array instead of the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < this.length * 2; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate twice as many times as it should, potentially causing an infinite loop or an out-of-bounds error.

DONE.
