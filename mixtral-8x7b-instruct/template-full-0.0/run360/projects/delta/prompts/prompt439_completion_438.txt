 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider `retain: 0` as a truthy value, while the original condition checks if `retain` is an object and not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof nextOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true if `retain` is a function, whereas the original condition checks if `retain` is an object and not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.hasOwnProperty('retain')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if 'retain' is a direct property of the `nextOp` object, while the original condition checks if `retain` is an object and not null.

DONE.
