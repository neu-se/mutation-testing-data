  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the value of the href attribute as a string, while the modified code fragment would return the concatenation of the href attribute value and the string "test".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr("href")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the value of the href attribute as a string, while the modified code fragment would return the value of the href attribute as a jQuery object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr("href").val()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the value of the href attribute as a string, while the modified code fragment would return the value of the href attribute as a jQuery object and then extract the value of the href attribute from the jQuery object.

DONE.
