  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.toUpperCase(), options
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` would change the input value of `tzName` to uppercase, which could potentially cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.split('').reverse().join(''), options
```
This would result in different behavior because `split`, `reverse`, and `join` would change the input value of `tzName` to a reversed string, which could potentially cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.substr(1), options
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` would return a substring of the input value of `tzName`, starting from the second character. This could potentially cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.

DONE.
