  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) || (this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional check for the case where the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are both zero, which is not covered by the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) || (this['re'] !== 0 && this['im'] !== 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional check for the case where the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are not both zero, which is not covered by the original code fragment.
