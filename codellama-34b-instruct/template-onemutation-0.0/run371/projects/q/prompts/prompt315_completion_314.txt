  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `void 0` is a function that returns `undefined`. In the original code, `fallback` is expected to be a function, and `void 0` is used to ensure that it is not undefined. If `fallback` is replaced with `null`, it will be considered a function and may cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
