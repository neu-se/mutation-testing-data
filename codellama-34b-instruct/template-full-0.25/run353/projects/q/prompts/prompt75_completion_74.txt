  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a different function than `requestPortTick`, and it would cause the code to enter a different branch of the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick()` is a function call, whereas `requestPortTick` is a reference to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestPortTick()` is a function call, whereas `requestTick` is a reference to a function.

DONE.
