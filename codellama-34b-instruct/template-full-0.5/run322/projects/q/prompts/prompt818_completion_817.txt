  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the reason to the `rejected` function, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved, value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value to the `resolved` function, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resolved` function with the value as an argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
