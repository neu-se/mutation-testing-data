  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^http:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that starts with "//", which is a common way to write a URL with a protocol relative to the current protocol. The new code fragment only matches strings that start with "http://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that starts with "//", which is a common way to write a URL with a protocol relative to the current protocol. The new code fragment only matches strings that start with "https://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that starts with "//", which is a common way to write a URL with a protocol relative to the current protocol. The new code fragment only matches strings that start with "//".

DONE.
