  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a fulfilled promise, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function() { return Q.reject() })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then()` returns a promise that is pending, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is pending.

DONE.
