  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` would return a string representation of the promise's state, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the promise's value or reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return promise.inspect(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` would return a new promise that resolves with the return value of the callback function, which in this case is `promise.inspect()`. This would result in a promise that resolves with a string representation of the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return promise.inspect(); }, function() { return promise.inspect(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` would return a new promise that resolves with the return value of the first callback
