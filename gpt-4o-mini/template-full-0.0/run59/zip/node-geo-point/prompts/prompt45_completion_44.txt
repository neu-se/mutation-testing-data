Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r < 0 ? 0 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly returns 0 when `r` is negative, which is not a valid output for the original function that should clamp `r` to a maximum of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 2 ? 2 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because it clamps `r` to a maximum of 2 instead of 1, which changes the expected output range of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r === 1 ? 0 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns 0 when `r` is exactly 1, which is not the intended behavior of the original code that should return 1 in that case.

DONE.
