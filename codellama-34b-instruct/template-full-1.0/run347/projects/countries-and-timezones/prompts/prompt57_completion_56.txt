  I'm happy to help you with this task.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!countries[id] || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, even if the country with the given id exists in the `countries` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false, even if the country with the given id doesn't exist in the `countries` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof countries[id] !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true if the `countries` object doesn't have a property with the given id, regardless of whether the property exists or not.

DONE.
