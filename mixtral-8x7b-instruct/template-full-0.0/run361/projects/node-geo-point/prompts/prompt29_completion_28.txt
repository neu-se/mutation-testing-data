 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), which would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return incorrect distances based on the randomly generated latitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the same latitude value for both `point1` and `point2`, causing the `calculateDistance` method to return incorrect distances based on the identical latitude values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the latitude value of `point2`, causing the `calculateDistance` method to return incorrect distances based on the negated latitude value.

DONE.
