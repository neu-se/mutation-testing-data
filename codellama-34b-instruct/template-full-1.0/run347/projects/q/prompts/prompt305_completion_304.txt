  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++i
```
This would result in different behavior because the prefix increment operator `++i` returns the value of `i` after it has been incremented, whereas the postfix increment operator `i++` returns the value of `i` before it has been incremented. In the context of the loop, this would cause the loop to omit processing the first element of the array in the case of a prefix increment, and process the last element twice in the case of a postfix increment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to skip every other element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the assignment operator `=` to set `i` to a new value, instead of incrementing `i` with the `++` operator. In
