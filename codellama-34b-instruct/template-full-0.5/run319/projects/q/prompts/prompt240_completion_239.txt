  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is a promise, and `null` is not a promise, so the `valueOf` method would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is a promise, and `undefined` is not a promise, so the `valueOf` method would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.valueOf() === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue.valueOf()` would return a different value than `nearerValue`, which could affect the behavior of the `valueOf` method.

DONE.
