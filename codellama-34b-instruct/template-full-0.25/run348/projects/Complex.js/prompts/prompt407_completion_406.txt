  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the imaginary part of the complex number, while this replacement uses the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the imaginary part of the complex number, while this replacement uses the imaginary part plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] * x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the imaginary part of the complex number, while this replacement uses the product of the real and imaginary parts.

DONE.
