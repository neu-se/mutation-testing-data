  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)/i
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the singular nouns "\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b" are added to the list of irregular verbs, but in the buggy snippet, it is instead added to the list of plural rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(although|accordingly)/i
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the irregular verbs "\b(?:although|accordingly)\b" are added to the list of plural rules, but in the buggy snippet, it is instead added to the list of singular nouns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(like|likes)/i
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code
