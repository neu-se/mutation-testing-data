  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because `!test` is the negation of `test`, which means that the `if` statement would be entered if `test` is falsy, instead of if `cb` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb != test
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb != test` is a comparison between `cb` and `test`, which means that the `if` statement would be entered if `cb` is not equal to `test`, instead of if `cb` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test(cb)` is a function call, which means that the `if` statement would be entered if `test(cb)` returns a truthy value, instead of if `cb` is falsy.

DONE.
