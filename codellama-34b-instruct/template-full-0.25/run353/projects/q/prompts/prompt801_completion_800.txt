  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a function, so it would cause a runtime error when the `progressed` callback is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a function, so it would cause a runtime error when the `progressed` callback is invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function is not the same as the original `progressed` callback, which could potentially have side effects or affect the behavior of the program.

DONE.
