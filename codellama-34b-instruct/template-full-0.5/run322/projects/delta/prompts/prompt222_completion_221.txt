  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the second string in the `strings` array, rather than the first string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length of the first string in the `strings` array, rather than the first string itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0] + strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the first and second strings in the `strings` array, rather than comparing them separately.

DONE.
