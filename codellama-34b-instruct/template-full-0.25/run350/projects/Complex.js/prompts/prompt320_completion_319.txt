  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which multiplies `b` by 2, while the new code fragment multiplies `a` by 2. This change would cause the function to produce different results for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which multiplies `b` by 2, while the new code fragment squares `b`. This change would cause the function to produce different results for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which multiplies `b` by 2, while the new code fragment adds `a` and `b`. This change would cause the function to produce different results for certain input values.

DONE.
