 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the UTF-16 BOM character with a space, which might not remove the BOM correctly in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\u00A0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the UTF-16 BOM character with a non-breaking space, which might not remove the BOM correctly in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first character of the content string instead of checking if it starts with the UTF-16 BOM character, which might remove more characters than intended.

DONE.
