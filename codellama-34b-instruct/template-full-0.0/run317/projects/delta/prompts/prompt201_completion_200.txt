  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the result of `concat`, which is a `Delta` object, while this code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `rest` variable, which is an `OpIterator` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the result of `concat`, which is a `Delta` object, while this code fragment calls the `slice` method on the `rest` variable, which is an `OpIterator` object, and takes a different range of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the
