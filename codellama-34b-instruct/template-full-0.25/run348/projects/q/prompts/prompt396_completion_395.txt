  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `undefined`, regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `null`, regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return !value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the negation of `value`, regardless of its value.

DONE.
