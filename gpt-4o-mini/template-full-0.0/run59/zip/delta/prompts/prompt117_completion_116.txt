Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `elem.insert` is exactly zero, which would not account for any truthy values of `elem.insert`, potentially leading to incorrect length calculations when `elem.insert` is a positive number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for the presence of `elem.delete` instead of `elem.insert`, which would lead to incorrect length calculations by ignoring the `insert` property entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the condition to only consider `elem.insert` values greater than 1, which would skip counting any `elem.insert` values of 1 or less, leading to an inaccurate total length.

DONE.
