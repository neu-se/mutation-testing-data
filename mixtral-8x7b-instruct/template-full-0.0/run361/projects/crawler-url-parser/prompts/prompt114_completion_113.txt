 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.from(urlMap.keys())[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it gets the first key instead of an arbitrary value from the Map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.entries().next().value[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it gets the first entry's value instead of an arbitrary value from the Map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(function() { return urlMap.values(); })().next().value
