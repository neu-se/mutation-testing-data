  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error when `error` is null, however, this replacement would cause the function to return `null` instead of throwing an error, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that depends on this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error when `error` is undefined, however, this replacement would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of throwing an error, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that depends on this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error when `error` is a string, however, this replacement would cause the function to return "error" instead of throwing an error, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that depends on this function.

DONE.
