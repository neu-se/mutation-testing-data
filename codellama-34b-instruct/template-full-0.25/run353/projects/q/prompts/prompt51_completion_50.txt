  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that schedules a task to be executed in the future, but `requestTick()` would immediately execute the task instead of scheduling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick.bind(null)` would return a new function that is bound to the `null` context, but it would not execute the task.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick.call(null)` would execute the task immediately, but it would do so in the context of the `null` object, which is not the same as the context of the `requestTick` function.

DONE.
