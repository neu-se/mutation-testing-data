  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a property, while this new code fragment checks for the absence of a property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a property, while this new code fragment checks for the absence of a property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a property, while this new code fragment checks for the absence of a property.

DONE.
