  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.latitude) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the latitude to be incremented by 1 degree, which would result in a different point on the Earth's surface.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `longitude` would be used instead of the `latitude`, which would cause the calculation to be performed on a different axis.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function would be used instead of the `deg2rad` function, which would cause the calculation to be performed in the opposite direction.

DONE.
