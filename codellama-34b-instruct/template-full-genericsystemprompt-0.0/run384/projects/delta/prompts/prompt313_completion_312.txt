  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a different property than `op.insert`, and it would cause the code to behave differently when encountering a delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a different property than `op.insert`, and it would cause the code to behave differently when encountering a retain operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is a different property than `op.insert`, and it would cause the code to behave differently when encountering an operation with attributes.

DONE.
