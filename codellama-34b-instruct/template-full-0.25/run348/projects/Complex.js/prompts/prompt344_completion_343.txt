  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * a` is the product of the real and imaginary parts, which would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is the sum of the real and imaginary parts, which would change the result of the function.

DONE.
