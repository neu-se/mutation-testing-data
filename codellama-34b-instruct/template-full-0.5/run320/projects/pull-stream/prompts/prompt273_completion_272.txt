  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'undefined' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is a function, while this replacement checks if `stream` is undefined. If `stream` is undefined, the replacement will return true, while the original code fragment will return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'number' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is a function, while this replacement checks if `stream` is a number. If `stream` is a number, the replacement will return true, while the original code fragment will return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is a function, while this replacement checks if `stream` is a string. If `stream` is a string, the replacement will return true, while the original code fragment will return false.
