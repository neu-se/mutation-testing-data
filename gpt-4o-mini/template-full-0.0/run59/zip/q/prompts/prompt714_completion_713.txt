Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise with the provided object, rather than dispatching a "keys" operation, which would return the keys of the object asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array of numbers as the second argument to the dispatch method instead of an empty array, potentially causing the "keys" operation to behave incorrectly or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("getKeys", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to dispatch a "getKeys" operation instead of "keys", which may not be defined, leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
