  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with a different set of arguments, which could affect the test suite's ability to detect errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with a different set of arguments, which could affect the test suite's ability to detect errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, last)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with a different set of arguments, which could affect the test suite's ability to detect errors.

DONE.
