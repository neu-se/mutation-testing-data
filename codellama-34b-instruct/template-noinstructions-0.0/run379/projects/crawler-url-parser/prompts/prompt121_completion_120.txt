  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.values())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of values from the `urlMap` object, rather than an array of objects with `url`, `text`, and `type` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of keys from the `urlMap` object, rather than an array of objects with `url`, `text`, and `type` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of key-value pairs from the `urlMap` object, rather than an array of objects with `url`, `text`, and `type` properties.

DONE.
