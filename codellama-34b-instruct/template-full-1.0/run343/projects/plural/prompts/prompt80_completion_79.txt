  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the correct plural form of the word "goose" is "geese," and omitting the "s" would result in an incorrect plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'louse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the correct plural form of the word "louse" is "lice," and inserting an "s" would result in an incorrect plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the correct plural form of the word "person" is "people," and inserting an "s" would result in an incorrect plural form.

DONE.
