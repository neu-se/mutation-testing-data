  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` context of the callback function would be bound to the `promise` object, whereas in the original code it is bound to the global object or undefined in strict mode.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(Q.Promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` context of the callback function would be bound to the `Q.Promise` constructor function, whereas in the original code it is bound to the global object or undefined in strict mode.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` context of the callback function would be null in strict mode, whereas in the original code it is bound to the global object or undefined in strict mode.

DONE.
