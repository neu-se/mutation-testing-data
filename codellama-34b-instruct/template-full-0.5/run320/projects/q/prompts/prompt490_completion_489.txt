  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected == true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` since `rejected` is a function and not a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected == "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` since `rejected` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.call(this, reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `rejected` function with the `reason` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
