  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the third argument to `URL.parse()` would cause the function to not remove the query string from the URL, which would result in a different URL being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the second argument to `URL.parse()` would cause the function to not remove the protocol from the URL, which would result in a different URL being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value passed as the third argument to `URL.parse()` would cause the function to remove the query string and protocol from the URL, which would result in a different URL being returned.

DONE.
