  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test` is a function that returns a boolean value, whereas `prop` is an object that contains the `test` function as a property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test()` is a function call that returns a boolean value, whereas `prop` is an object that contains the `test` function as a property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test.bind(this)` is a function that returns a bound function, whereas `prop` is an object that contains the `test` function as a property.

DONE.
