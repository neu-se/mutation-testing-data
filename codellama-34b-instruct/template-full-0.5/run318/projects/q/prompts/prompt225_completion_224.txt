  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a different function than `array_reduce`, and it would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` is a different function than `array_slice`, and it would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a different function than `array_reduce`, and it would return a different result.

DONE.
