  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch` function without the first element, which is the `resolve` function. This would cause the promise to be resolved with the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch` function without the first two elements, which are the `resolve` function and the `op` argument. This would cause the promise to be resolved with the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch` function without the first three elements, which are the `resolve` function, the `op` argument, and the `operands` argument. This would
