  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `null` instead of a boolean value, which may cause unexpected results in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would only check the first rule in the `this.rules` array, which may not cover all possible rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = new Rule();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would create a new rule object instead of using an existing one, which may not have the same properties or behavior as the existing rules.

DONE.
