  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to be applied to the real part of the complex number, rather than the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to be applied to the imaginary part of the complex number plus one, rather than just the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to be applied to the negative of the imaginary part of the complex number, rather than just the imaginary part.

DONE.
