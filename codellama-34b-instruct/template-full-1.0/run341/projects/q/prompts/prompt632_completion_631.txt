  Option 1:
```
[object]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[object]` placeholder would be replaced with the value of the `object` variable, which may not refer to the same object as the `object` parameter passed to the `Q.del` method.

Option 2:
```
[this[key]]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this[key]` would access a property of the object referenced by the `this` keyword, whereas the original code fragment accessed a property of the `object` parameter.

Option 3:
```
["key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `"key"` is a string literal, whereas the original code fragment accessed a property of the `object` parameter.

DONE.
