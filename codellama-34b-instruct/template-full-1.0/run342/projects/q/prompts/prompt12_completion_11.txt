  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses !==="undefined""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the variable `ses` is defined using the `typeof` operator, while this new code fragment checks if the variable `ses` is undefined using the `typeof` operator in a negated manner.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the variable `ses` is defined using the `typeof` operator, while this new code fragment checks if the variable `ses` is undefined using the `typeof` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the variable `ses` is defined using the `typeof` operator, while this new code fragment checks if the variable `ses` is undefined using the inequality operator in a negated manner.

DONE.
