  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``{ this: thisp }, arguments``
This would result in different behavior because the function would receive a different `this` context, which could cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```void 0, arguments```
This would result in different behavior because the function would receive `void 0` as the `this` context, which could cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```"str", arguments```
This would result in different behavior because the function would receive the string `"str"` as the `this` context, which could cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
