  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the array, or -1 if it is not found. In this case, if `atReport` is greater than -1, it means that the `promise` is present in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which means that it has already been reported as an unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because if `atReport` is equal to -1, it means that the `promise` is not present in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which means that it has not been reported as an unhandled rejection yet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because if `atReport` is less than -
