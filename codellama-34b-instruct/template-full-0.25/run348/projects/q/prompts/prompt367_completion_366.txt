  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function is called instead of the `rejected` function, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because a `null` value is passed to the `rejected` function instead of the original `exception` value, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because a new `Error` object is passed to the `rejected` function instead of the original `exception` value, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
