Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof err === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `err` is a string instead of verifying if it is a function, which would lead to incorrect handling of callback functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `err` is null or undefined, which would bypass the intended check for a function type and potentially lead to unexpected behavior when `err` is a valid function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err instanceof Error
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `err` is an instance of the Error class, which would not correctly identify a function type and could cause the abort logic to fail when a function is expected.

DONE.
