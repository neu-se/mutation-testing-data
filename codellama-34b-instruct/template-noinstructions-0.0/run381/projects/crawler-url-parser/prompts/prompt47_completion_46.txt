  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the parsed URL from the current URL, rather than the base URL, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the href property of the parsed base URL, rather than the parsed URL itself, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would parse the base URL string, rather than the parsed URL, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
