  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation would be performed on the next element in the array, rather than the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation would be performed on the previous element in the array, rather than the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation would be performed twice on the current element, rather than just once.

DONE.
