  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "post" method, but this replacement uses the "apply" method, which may have different behavior in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "post" method, but this replacement uses the "apply" method, which may have different behavior in some cases. Additionally, this replacement uses a different argument for the "array_slice" method, which may also affect the behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "post" method,
