  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function returns a rejected promise, whereas the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with the `exception` object as the reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve` function returns a resolved promise, whereas the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with the `exception` object as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function returns a promise that is resolved with the `exception` object, whereas the original code fragment returns a rejected promise with the `exception` object as the reason.

DONE.
