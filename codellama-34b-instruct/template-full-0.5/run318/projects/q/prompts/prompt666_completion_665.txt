  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 2, regardless of the actual arguments passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return null, regardless of the actual arguments passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return undefined, regardless of the actual arguments passed to it.

DONE.
