  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index + 1)
```
This change will cause the `hasNext()` method to return `true` even if there are no more ops in the iterator, because it will always return the length of the next op, which is 1 in this case. This change will not affect the behavior of the `next()` method, but it will cause the `hasNext()` method to return `true` when it should return `false`, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index - 1)
```
This change will cause the `hasNext()` method to return `false` even if there are more ops in the iterator, because it will always return the length of the previous op, which is 0 in this case. This change will not affect the behavior of the `next()` method, but it will cause the `hasNext()` method to return `false` when it should return `true`,
