  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._emit
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a non-existent method named `_emit`, causing a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._emit('error', new Error('Corrupted row'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a different message, which might cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this specific error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a null error message, which might cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting a null error message.

DONE.
