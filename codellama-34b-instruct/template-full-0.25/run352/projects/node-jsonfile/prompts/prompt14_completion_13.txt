  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `shouldThrow`, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, even if `shouldThrow` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(shouldThrow && false)`, which would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(shouldThrow || false)`, which would always evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
