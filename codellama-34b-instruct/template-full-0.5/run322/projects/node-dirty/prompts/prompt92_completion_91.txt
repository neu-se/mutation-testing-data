  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The database is empty')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error message that is thrown when an empty line is encountered in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The database is corrupted')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error message that is thrown when a corrupted row is encountered in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The database is in a bad state')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error message that is thrown when the database is in a bad state.

DONE.
