 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === max
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `cb(true)` when `i` is equal to `max`, instead of when `i` is greater than `max`. This could cause the function to stop counting early if `max` is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `cb(null, i++)` and never return `cb(true)`, even if `i` is greater than `max`. This could cause the function to continue counting indefinitely if `max` is not specified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end > i
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only return `cb && cb(end)` if `end` is truthy and greater than `i`. This could cause the function to skip some values if `end` is specified and is less than `
