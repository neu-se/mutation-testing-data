  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the array, whereas the original code fragment mutates the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method creates a new array with the elements of the original array, whereas the original code fragment mutates the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.map(function(arg) { return arg; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map()` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array, whereas the original code fragment mutates the original array.

DONE.
