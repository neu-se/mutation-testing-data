  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is not needed and would cause the code to always return `false` if `op.delete` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is checking for inequality, not equality, and would cause the code to always return `true` if `op.delete` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is checking for equality, not inequality, and would cause the code to always return `false` if `op.delete` is not a string.

DONE.
