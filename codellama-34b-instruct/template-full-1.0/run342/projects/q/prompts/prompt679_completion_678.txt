  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because "apply" is a function name that is not defined in the given code. The original code likely refers to the "apply()" function of the Function prototype, which is not present in the given code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different function name that is not defined in the given code. The original code likely refers to the "call()" function of the Function prototype, which is not present in the given code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" is a function name that is not defined in the given code. The original code likely refers to the "bind()" function of the Function prototype, which is not present in the given code.

DONE.
