  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^\/]+)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would capture the last slash and any character that follows it, rather than the last slash and any character that follows it except for another slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^([^\/]+\/)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match the last slash and any character that follows it if it is preceded by one or more slashes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^\/]+\/)\/?/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the last slash and any character that follows it, including any trailing slashes, and it would capture the last slash and any character that follows it in a group.

DONE.
