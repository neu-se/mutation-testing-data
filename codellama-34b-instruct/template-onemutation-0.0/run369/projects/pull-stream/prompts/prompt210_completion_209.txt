  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` calls the `cb` function with the `aborted` argument, while the new code fragment `abortCb(aborted)` calls the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` argument. The `abortCb` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, so it is not clear what its behavior would be. However, it is likely that the new code fragment would result in a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
