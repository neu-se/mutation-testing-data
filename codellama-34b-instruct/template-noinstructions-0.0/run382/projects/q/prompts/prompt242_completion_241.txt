  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is a promise, and `nearerValue.promise` is a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue.then()` returns a new promise that is resolved with the value returned by the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.catch(function(error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue.catch()` returns a new promise that is rejected with the error thrown by the callback function.

DONE.
