 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would now consider `null` to be an object, which could cause issues in code that relies on this function to correctly identify objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would now consider empty strings to be objects, which could cause issues in code that relies on this function to correctly identify objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would now always return `true`, since `true` is an object in JavaScript. This could cause issues in code that relies on this function to correctly identify non-object values.

DONE.
