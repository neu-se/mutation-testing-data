  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes > null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes > null` check would always be true, making the entire expression always true, regardless of the actual value of `attributes` or the number of keys in the `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != undefined &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes != undefined` check would be true if the `attributes` object is not undefined, even if it is an empty object or if the number of keys in the object is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys(attributes).length` check would always be at least one, even if the `
