  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones === memoizedTimezones
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the total number of timezones is not equal to the number of memoized timezones, while this replacement checks if they are equal. This would cause the `getAllTimezones` function to return all timezones, even if they have already been memoized, which could lead to unnecessary computation and memory usage.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones > memoizedTimezones
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the total number of timezones is not equal to the number of memoized timezones, while this replacement checks if the total number of timezones is greater than the number of memoized timezones. This would cause the `getAllTimezones` function to return all timezones, even if they have already been memoized, which could lead to unnecessary computation and memory usage.
