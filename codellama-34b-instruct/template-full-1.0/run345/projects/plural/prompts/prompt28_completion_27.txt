  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the word is reduced by one, resulting in incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1, w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the word is increased by one, resulting in incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length / 2, w.length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the word is divided by two, resulting in incorrect pluralization.

DONE.
