  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a resolved URL string, while `URL.parse` returns a URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string, while `URL.parse` returns a URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrl).resolve(parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse(baseUrl).resolve(parsedUrl)` would return a resolved URL object, while `URL.parse` returns a URL object.

DONE.
