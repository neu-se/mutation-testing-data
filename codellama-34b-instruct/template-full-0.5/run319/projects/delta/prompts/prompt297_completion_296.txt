  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause it to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes && {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause it to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause it to return a different value.

DONE.
