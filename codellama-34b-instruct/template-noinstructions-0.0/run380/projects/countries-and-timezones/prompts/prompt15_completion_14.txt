  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tz.r` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is not undefined. This change could potentially cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different result for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tz.r` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is null. This change could potentially cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different result for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tz.r` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is the string "undefined". This change could potentially cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different result for certain inputs.

DONE.
