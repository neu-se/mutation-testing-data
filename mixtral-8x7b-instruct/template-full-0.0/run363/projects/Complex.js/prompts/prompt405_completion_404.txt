 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / x['re'], x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the result would be inverted, and the imaginary part would remain unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x['re'] * x['im'], x['im']
