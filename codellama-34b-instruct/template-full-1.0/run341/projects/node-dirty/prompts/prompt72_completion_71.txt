  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with a count of 1 instead of 0, potentially causing the listener to interpret the database as having more data than it actually does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', 'Simulated error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `error` event to be emitted with a simulated error message, potentially causing the listener to take a different action or display a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load',
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted without any additional information, potentially causing the listener to behave differently or throw an exception.

DONE.
