  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment is subtracting 1. This would cause the plural form of words that end in -us to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment is subtracting 3. This would cause the plural form of words that end in -us to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 2 from the length of the word, while this new code fragment is subtracting 4. This would cause the plural form of words that end in -us to be incorrect.

DONE.
