  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the function scope, whereas `arguments` refers to the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from the argument list, and would therefore cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is a distinct value from the argument list, and would therefore cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
