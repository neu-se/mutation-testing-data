  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would cause the code to skip the next line of code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator would cause the code to skip the previous line of code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator would cause the code to execute the same line of code twice.

DONE.
