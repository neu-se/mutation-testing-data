  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `arguments` to refer to the arguments passed to the function, and `1` to refer to the first argument. By changing `1` to `2`, the code would refer to the second argument instead, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
