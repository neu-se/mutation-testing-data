 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function is redefined, causing the `continuer` function to lose its error handling functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be overwritten by a number, causing a `TypeError` when `continuer` is called with the `"next"` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
generator.next
