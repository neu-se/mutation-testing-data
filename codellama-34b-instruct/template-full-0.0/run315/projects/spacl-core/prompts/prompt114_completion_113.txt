  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let verb
```
This would result in different behavior because `let` is a block-scoped variable declaration, while `const` is a constant declaration. In this context, `let` would allow the variable `verb` to be reassigned, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior in the `deny` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb = 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the string `'foo'` to the variable `verb`, which could potentially cause the `deny` method to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb = verbs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the first element of the `verbs` array to the variable `verb`, which could potentially cause the `deny` method to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
