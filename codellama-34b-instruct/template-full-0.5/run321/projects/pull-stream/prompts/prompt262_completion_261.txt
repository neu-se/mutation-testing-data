  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, but `null` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, but `undefined` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, but the string `'error'` is truthy.

DONE.
