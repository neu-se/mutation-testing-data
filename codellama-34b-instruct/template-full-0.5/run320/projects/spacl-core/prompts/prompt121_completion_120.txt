  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(this.regex, ''), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.replace()` returns a new string with the matches replaced, whereas the original code uses `path, ctx` which returns the original path and context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.match()` returns an array of matches, whereas the original code uses `path, ctx` which returns the original path and context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split(this.regex), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.split()` returns an array of substrings, whereas the original code uses `path, ctx` which returns the original path and context.

DONE.
