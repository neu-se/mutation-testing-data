  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is equal to the length of the `ops` array, while the new code fragment checks if the index is less than the length of the `ops` array. This would cause the `push` method to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is equal to the length of the `ops` array, while the new code fragment checks if the index is greater than the length of the `ops` array. This would cause the `push` method to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is equal to the length of the `ops` array
