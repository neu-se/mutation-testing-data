  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called with `value`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with `value` as the reason, whereas `become` would resolve the promise with `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value)` creates a new promise that is resolved with `value`, whereas `become` would resolve the promise with `value` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is called with `value`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `value` as the value, whereas `become` would resolve the promise with `value` directly.

DONE.
