  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && true === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `true === op(data)` would always be false, so the `abort` function would never be called, even if `op` returned a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false !== op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `false !== op(data)` would always be true, so the `abort` function would always be called, even if `op` returned a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `false === op(data)` would always be false, so the `abort` function would never be called, even if `op` returned a falsy value.

DONE.
