  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that sets a value in the `this._data` object, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves a value from the object. Using `set` instead of `get` would cause the code to set the value of `row.val` to `undefined`, which would result in the `if (row.val === undefined)` block being executed, even if `row.val` was previously set to a non-undefined value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a key-value pair from the `this._data` object, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves a value from the object. Using `delete` instead of `get` would cause the code to remove the key-value pair for `row.key` from the object, which would result in the `if (row.val === undefined)` block being
