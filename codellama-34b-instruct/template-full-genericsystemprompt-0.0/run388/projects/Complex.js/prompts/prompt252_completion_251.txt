  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(b) - 1` is not the same as `cosm1(b)`, which is a function that calculates the cosine minus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(b) + 1` is not the same as `cosm1(b)`, which is a function that calculates the cosine minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(b) * 2` is not the same as `cosm1(b)`, which is a function that calculates the cosine minus one.

DONE.
