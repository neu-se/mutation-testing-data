  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `base` delta from `baseIndex` to `baseIndex + length`, which is not the same as slicing from `baseIndex` to `baseIndex + 1` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `base` delta from `baseIndex` to `baseIndex + 2`, which is not the same as slicing from `baseIndex` to `baseIndex + 1` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `base` delta from `baseIndex` to `baseIndex + length - 1`, which
