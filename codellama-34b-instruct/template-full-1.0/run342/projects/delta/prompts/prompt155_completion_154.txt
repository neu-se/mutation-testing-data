  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to return an empty `Delta` object, even if there are more ops to concatenate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to skip over any `insert` operations in the `other` `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return otherIter.peekLength() > thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to only append operations from the `other` `Delta` object if the current operation in the `this` `Delta` object is shorter in length than the current operation in the `other` `Delta` object.

DONE.
