 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'bacteria' => 'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the original addRule for a rule that has the 'from' and 'to' arguments reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['bacteria', function(w) { return w + 'a'; }]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the original addRule to add a rule that appends an 'a' to the word instead of replacing the 'ium' with 'ia'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['bacterium', function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ia'; }]
