  I have prepared three mutations for you to consider:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is not a valid event in the `WriteStream` class, so this code would not work as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.on
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive` is not a `WriteStream`, so `zipArchive.on` would not work as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.end()` would prematurely close the `WriteStream` before the `zipArchive` has finished writing to it, causing errors.

DONE.
