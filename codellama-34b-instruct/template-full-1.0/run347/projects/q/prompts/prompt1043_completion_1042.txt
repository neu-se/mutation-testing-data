  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method now returns the `tail` property instead of the `head`, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method now returns the `tail` property of the `ends.promise`, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
"close"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method now returns the value of the `close` property, which is a different value than the original `head` property.

DONE.
