  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the variables is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self, false
```
This would result in different behavior because a third argument is being added to the call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because a third argument is being added to the call, and it is not being passed explicitly.

DONE.
