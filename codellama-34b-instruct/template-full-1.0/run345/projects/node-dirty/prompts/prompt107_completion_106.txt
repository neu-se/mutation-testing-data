  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val, row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the same value for every key, regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the same key for every value, regardless of the input key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the value of each key to be twice the input value, regardless of the input value.

DONE.
