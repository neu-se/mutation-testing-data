  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `reject` method would be called instead of the `resolve` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `reject` method would be called instead of the `resolve` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"error"` is truthy, so the `resolve` method would be called instead of the `reject` method.

DONE.
