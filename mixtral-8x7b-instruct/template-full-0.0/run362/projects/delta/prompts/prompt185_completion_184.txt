 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `otherOp` with a non-null `retain` property as a "retain" operation, even if the property is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof otherOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `otherOp` with a string `retain` property as a "retain" operation, even if the property is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherOp.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider only `otherOp` with a positive `retain` property as a "retain" operation, excluding cases where the `retain` property is zero or negative.

DONE.
