  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would be used instead of the `-` operator, which would cause the result of the subtraction to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would be used instead of the `-` operator, which would cause the result of the subtraction to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] / this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator would be used instead of the `-` operator, which would cause the result of the subtraction to be different.

DONE.
