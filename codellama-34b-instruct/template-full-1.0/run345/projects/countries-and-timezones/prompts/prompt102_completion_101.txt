  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create` creates a new object with the specified prototype, whereas `Object.assign` copies the properties from one object to another.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of an object, whereas `Object.assign` modifies the target object by copying the properties from the source object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of an object, whereas `Object.assign` modifies the target object by copying the properties from the source object.

DONE.
