  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|| true` would always evaluate to `true`, making the `if` statement always execute the `console.warn` and `throw` statements, regardless of the value of `done`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& false` would always evaluate to `false`, making the `if` statement never execute the `console.warn` and `throw` statements, regardless of the value of `done`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done && !done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!done && !done` would always evaluate to `false`, making the `if` statement never execute the `console.warn` and `throw` statements, regardless of the value of `done`.

DONE.
