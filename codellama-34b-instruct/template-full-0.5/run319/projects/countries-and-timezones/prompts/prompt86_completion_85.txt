  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the country's ID instead of the country object to the `getCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.name, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the country's name instead of the country object to the `getCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.timezones[0], options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first timezone of the country instead of the country object to the `getCountry` function.

DONE.
