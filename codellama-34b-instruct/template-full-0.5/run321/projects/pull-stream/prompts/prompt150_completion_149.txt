  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is always a function, so the original code would always return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)`. However, with this change, the code would only return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)` if `abort` is not null, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` and `abort` are different variables, so the original code would always return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)`. However, with this change, the code would only return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)` if `value` is not equal to `abort`, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort != null
```
