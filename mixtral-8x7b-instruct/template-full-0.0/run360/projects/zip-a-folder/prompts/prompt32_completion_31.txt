 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error event handler would now check for a 'warning' string instead of 'error', and the Promise would not reject the error as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed as the error event handler, effectively muting any errors that occur during the compression process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive.on('end', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'end' event is emitted when the compression process is finished, not when an error occurs. The Promise would reject even if the compression process is successful, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
