 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `result.value`, would not be executed and instead `null` would be passed to `when()`. This could cause issues if `when()` does not handle `null` inputs correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result['value']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses array-like access to the `result` object instead of the dot notation. If the `result` object does not have a `value` property or if it is not configurable, this could cause issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { return result.value; })()
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the original code fragment in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). This could cause issues if the code relies on the original code fragment being executed in the same context as the surrounding code.

DONE.
