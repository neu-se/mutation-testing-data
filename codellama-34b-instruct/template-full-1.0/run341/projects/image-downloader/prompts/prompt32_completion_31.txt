  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode != 200
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the status code is not equal to 200, rather than not equal to 200 and above.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!res.statusCode
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the status code is falsy, rather than checking if it is not equal to 200.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode < 200
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the status code is less than 200, rather than not equal to 200.

DONE.
