  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that inserts a new element at the end of the line, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from the line, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from the line, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the line.

DONE.
