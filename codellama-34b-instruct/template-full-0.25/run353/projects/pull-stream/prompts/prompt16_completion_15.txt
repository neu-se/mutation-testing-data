  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object is one less than the number of arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object is one less than the number of arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object is one more than the number of arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
