  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a resolved promise with the value of the exception, but the replaced code returns a rejected promise with the error message as the reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a rejected promise with the exception as the reason, but the replaced code returns a resolved promise with `undefined` as the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.thenResolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a rejected promise with the exception as the reason, but the replaced code returns a resolved promise with `undefined` as the value, and the resolution is delayed until all previous promises in the promise chain are settled.

DONE.
