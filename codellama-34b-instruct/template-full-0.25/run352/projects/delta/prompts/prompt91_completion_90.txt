  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not an object. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is `undefined`. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is `null` or `undefined`. This could cause the `if` statement
