  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString().slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.toString()` will always return the string representation of the object, whereas `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)` will return the string representation of the object's underlying prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring()` is a different method than `slice()`, and it will not work correctly if the string representation of the object's prototype is not a valid substring of the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace()` is a different method than `slice()`, and it will not work correctly if the string representation of the object's prototype is not a valid regex pattern.

DONE.
