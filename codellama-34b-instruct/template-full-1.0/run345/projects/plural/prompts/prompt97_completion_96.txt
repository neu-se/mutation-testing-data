  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the word "woman" but not the word "man" or "wo", while the new code fragment matches the word "man" but not the word "woman" or "wo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the word "woman" but not the word "man" or "wo", while the new code fragment matches the word "man" but not the word "woman" or "wo".
