  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekLength() <= 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to
continue infinitely, as the iterator would never advance past the current
position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() != 'insert') {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to
terminate prematurely when the current op is not an insert.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherIter.peekType() === 'insert') {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to
terminate prematurely when the current op in the other delta is an insert.

DONE.
