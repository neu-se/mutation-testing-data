  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(result, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` is used to merge the current value of `result` with a new object, while this replacement only sets `result` to a new empty object, losing all the existing data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete result[country]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` is used to merge the current value of `result` with a new object, while this replacement deletes the `country` property from `result`, potentially removing data unnecessarily.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty(result, country, { value: null })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` is used to merge the current value of `result` with a new object, while this replacement sets the value of the `country` property to `null`, potentially changing the behavior of the code that uses `result`.

DONE.
