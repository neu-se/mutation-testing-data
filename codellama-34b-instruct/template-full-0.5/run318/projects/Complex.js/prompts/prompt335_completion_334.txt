  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(1, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, whereas the original code would return a value based on the input arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return π/2, whereas the original code would return a value based on the input arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return π/4, whereas the original code would return a value based on the input arguments.

DONE.
