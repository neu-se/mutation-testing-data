  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would return `false` for `null`, whereas it would return `true` for the original `value`. This could cause the `nearer` function to return a different value than expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

DONE.
