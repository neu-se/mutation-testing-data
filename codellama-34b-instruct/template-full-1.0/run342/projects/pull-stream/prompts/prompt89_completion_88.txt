  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use strict equality to compare the result of the `test` function with `true`, while the original code uses a non-strict comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `test` function, while the original code uses the result directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) !== test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the result of the `test` function with the function itself, while the original code compares the result with `true`.

DONE.
