  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++deferred.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because `++deferred.reject` would increment the `deferred.reject` value by 1, which would result in an incorrect error handling behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.retry(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.retry()` would cause the promise to be retried, which would result in an infinite loop if there's no `deferred.stop()` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.stop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.stop()` would stop the promise chain, which would result in the promise not being resolved or rejected, leading to a different behavior.

DONE.
