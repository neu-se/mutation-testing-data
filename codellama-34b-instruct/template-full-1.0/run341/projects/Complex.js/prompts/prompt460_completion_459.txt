  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned value to be 0, which is not the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned value to be 0, which is not the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned value to be 0, which is not the expected result.

DONE.
