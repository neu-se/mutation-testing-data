  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function expects a value to be passed as an argument, but `null` would be interpreted as a falsy value and would not fulfill the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function expects a value to be passed as an argument, but `undefined` would be interpreted as a falsy value and would not fulfill the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function expects a value to be passed as an argument, but `0` would be interpreted as a falsy value and would not fulfill the promise.

DONE.
