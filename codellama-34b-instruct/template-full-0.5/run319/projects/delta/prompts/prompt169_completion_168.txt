  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation in the iterator, which may not be the same as the original code that was intended to be replaced.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation in the other iterator, which may not be the same as the original code that was intended to be replaced.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation in the iterator, which may not be the same as the original code that was intended to be replaced.

DONE.
