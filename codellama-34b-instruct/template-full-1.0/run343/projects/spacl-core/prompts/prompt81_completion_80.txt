  Mutation testing is only performed on the test suite, not on the code that is being tested. The purpose of mutation testing is to identify weaknesses in the test suite, not to identify weaknesses in the code. Typically, mutation testing is performed by writing tests that exercise the code and then modifying the code in small ways to see how well the tests detect the changes.

In this case, the code that is being tested is a function that checks whether an action is allowed on a path based on a policy. The test suite for this function would likely include tests that verify that the function returns the correct result for different inputs, but it would not include tests that modify the function. Therefore, mutation testing of the code would not be appropriate.

It is more important to focus on improving the test suite so that it can effectively detect any changes to the code. This can be done by adding new tests, modifying existing tests, or refining the logic of the tests.
