  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.toUpperCase()` would always return the uppercase version of the `op` string, regardless of its original case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.slice(0)` would always return the first character of the `op` string, regardless of its original length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.length + 1` would always return the length of the `op` string plus one, regardless of its original length.

DONE.
