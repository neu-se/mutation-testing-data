  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises, whereas in the original code, it is only called for rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, function(error) { throw error; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas in the original code, the promise is resolved with the value returned by `onUnhandledError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, function(error) { return Q.reject(error); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function would cause the promise to be rejected with the error, whereas in the original code, the promise is resolved with the value returned by `onUnhandledError`.

DONE
