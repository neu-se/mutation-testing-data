Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because using a semicolon would cause the `src` string to be treated as a single element, preventing the intended splitting of the glob patterns and resulting in the entire string being processed as one glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because using a pipe character would change the delimiter for splitting the `src` string, which is not a valid glob pattern separator, leading to incorrect handling of the glob patterns and potentially missing files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because using a space as a delimiter would cause the `src` string to be split at spaces, which is not how glob patterns are intended to be separated, potentially resulting in incorrect globbing behavior and missing files in the archive.

DONE.
