  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `plus + minus` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if it is not equal to 0. This change would cause the code to behave differently when the `plus` and `minus` variables have the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus - minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `plus + minus` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `plus - minus` is equal to 0. This change would cause the code to behave differently when the `plus` and `minus` variables have opposite values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus * minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `plus + minus` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `plus * minus`
