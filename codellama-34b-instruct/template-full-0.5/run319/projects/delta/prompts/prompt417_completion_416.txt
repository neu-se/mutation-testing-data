  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` would increment the iterator, while `thisIter.next` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(length + 1)` would increment the iterator by `length + 1`, while `thisIter.next()` would increment it by `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(0)` would not increment the iterator, while `thisIter.next()` would.

DONE.
