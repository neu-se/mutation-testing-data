  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `encoding` property of the `options` object as the second argument to `stringify()`, rather than the `obj` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `reviver` property of the `options` object as the second argument to `stringify()`, rather than the `obj` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass both the `encoding` and `reviver` properties of the `options` object as the second and third arguments to `stringify()`, rather than just the `obj` object.

DONE.
