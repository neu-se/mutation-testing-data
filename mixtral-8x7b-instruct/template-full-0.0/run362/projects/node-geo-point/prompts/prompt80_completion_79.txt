 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * (coordinate.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the longitude by 1, which doesn't affect the value but introduces unnecessary computation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(coordinate.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the arcsine function instead of the degree-to-radian conversion, which can produce incorrect results for latitude values outside the range [-1, 1].

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(coordinate.longitude, coordinate.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the arctangent function with the longitude and latitude values swapped, which can produce incorrect results for the destination calculation.

DONE.
