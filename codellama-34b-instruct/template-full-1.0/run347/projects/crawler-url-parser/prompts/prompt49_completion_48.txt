  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 1:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl` is not provided, which in the original code is used to determine the relative URL.

Option 2:
```
URL.resolve(parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedBaseUrl` is not provided, which in the original code is used to determine the base URL for resolving the relative URL.

Option 3:
```
URL.resolve(parsedUrl, parsedBaseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the resolved URL to be incorrect.

DONE.
