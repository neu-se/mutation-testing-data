  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `fcall` is being called with no arguments, whereas the original code fragment had `callback` as the only argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `fcall` is being called with a different argument (`promise`) than the original code fragment (`callback`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(promise, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `fcall` is being called with two arguments (`promise` and `value`) whereas the original code fragment had only one argument (`callback`).

DONE.
