 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition checks if the index is less than or equal to the end index, and using `index + length` would cause the loop to iterate one more time than it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is used to keep track of the current position, and subtracting `length` from it would cause the loop to skip over some operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index * length
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying the index by the length would cause the loop to iterate in a non-linear fashion, potentially skipping over some operations or iterating over others multiple times.

DONE.
