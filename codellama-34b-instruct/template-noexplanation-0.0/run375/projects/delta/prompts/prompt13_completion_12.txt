  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This change will cause the `compose` function to return an array of values instead of an array of keys, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `compose` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This change will cause the `compose` function to return an array of key-value pairs instead of an array of keys, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `compose` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.length
```
This change will cause the `compose` function to return the length of the array of keys instead of the array of keys itself, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `compose` function.

DONE.
