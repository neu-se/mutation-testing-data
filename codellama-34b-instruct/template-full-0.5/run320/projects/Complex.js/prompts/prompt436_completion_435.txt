  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `1` if `places` is `0`, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `10` instead of `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ^ 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator would always return `0` if `places` is `0`, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `0` instead of `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ? 0 : 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?:` operator would always return `0` if `places` is `0`, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `0` instead of `1`.

DONE.
