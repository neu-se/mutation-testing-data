  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the error without checking if there are any callbacks in `cbs`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs[0](err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the first callback in `cbs`, instead of calling all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the error with the event name `'error'`, instead of using the `key` and `val` properties from the `row` object.

DONE.
