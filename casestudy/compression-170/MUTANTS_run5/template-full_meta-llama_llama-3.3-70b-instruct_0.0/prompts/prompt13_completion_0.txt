Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.writeHead(this.statusCode + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the HTTP status code sent in the response would be incremented by 1, potentially changing the interpretation of the response by the client.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.writeHeader
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeHeader` is not a valid method in this context, and would likely result in a runtime error, whereas the original code uses `writeHead` to send the HTTP headers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a method that forces the buffered data to be sent, but it does not send the HTTP headers, whereas the original code uses `writeHead` to send the HTTP headers, potentially changing the timing and content of the response.

DONE.
