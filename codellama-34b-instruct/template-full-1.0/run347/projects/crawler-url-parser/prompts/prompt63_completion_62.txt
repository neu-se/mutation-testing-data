  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.domain==ret.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment checks whether the domain and subdomain are the same, which is not the same as checking whether the protocol is `http` or `https`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host!="localhost"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment checks whether the host is not equal to `localhost`, which is not the same as checking whether the protocol is `http` or `https`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.path.startsWith("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment checks whether the path starts with a forward slash, which is not the same as checking whether the protocol is `http` or `https`.

DONE.
