 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the `dispatch` method call, potentially causing the method to not be found or the wrong method being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to the `dispatch` method, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty object as the first argument to the `dispatch` method, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
