  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds 'es'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds 's' twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'ices') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment replaces 'ics' with 'ices'.

DONE.
