  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `EOL` is a newline character, while the replacement `" "` is a space character. This would cause the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of a space character with the value of `EOL`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `EOL` is a newline character, while the replacement `"\\n"` is a string containing a newline character. This would cause the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of a newline character with the value of `EOL`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\r\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `EOL` is a newline character, while the replacement `"\\r\\n"` is a string containing a carriage return and a newline character.
