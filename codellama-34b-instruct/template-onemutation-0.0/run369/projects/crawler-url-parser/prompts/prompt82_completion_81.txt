  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `attr` method to get the `href` attribute of the current element, while the modified code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove any characters after the first semicolon in the `href` attribute. This could potentially cause the `href` attribute to be modified in a way that affects the behavior of the `parse` function.
