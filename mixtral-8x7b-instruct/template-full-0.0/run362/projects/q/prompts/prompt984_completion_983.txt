 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be always resolved instead of being rejected, which is the original behavior. This could hide errors and make the test suite ineffective in catching issues related to error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the rejection with an empty function, effectively suppressing error handling. This could make the test suite ineffective in catching issues related to error handling and unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to resolve the promise again, which is not allowed. This would cause an error, revealing a potential issue with the test suite's ability to handle such cases.

DONE.
