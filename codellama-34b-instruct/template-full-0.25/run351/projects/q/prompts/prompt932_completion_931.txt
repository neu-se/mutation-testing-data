  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 1` is not the same as `void 0`, and would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `void 0`, and would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `void 0`, and would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
