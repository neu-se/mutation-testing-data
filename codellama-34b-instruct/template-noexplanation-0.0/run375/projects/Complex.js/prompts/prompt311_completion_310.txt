  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This change will cause the `sec` function to return the sine of the angle instead of the cosine, which will result in incorrect results for some inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This change will cause the `sec` function to return the tangent of the angle instead of the cosine, which will result in incorrect results for some inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This change will cause the `sec` function to return the arccosine of the angle instead of the cosine, which will result in incorrect results for some inputs.

DONE.
