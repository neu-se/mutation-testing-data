  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, making the code execute the block if the peeked type is not 'insert', instead of if it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the block if the peeked type is 'delete', instead of if it is 'insert'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the block if the peeked type is 'retain', instead of if it is 'insert'.

DONE.
