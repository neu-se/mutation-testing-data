  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will change the sign of the value of `b`, potentially altering the calculation of the complex cosecans.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant will scale the value of `b`, potentially changing the calculation of the complex cosecans.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b + Math.random())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.random()` function will introduce randomness into the calculation of the complex cosecans, potentially causing the output to differ from the original calculation.

DONE.
