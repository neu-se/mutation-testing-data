  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `reject` function is called with `reason` as an argument, which is a value that indicates the reason for the rejection. Replacing `reason` with `null` would result in the rejection being called with a different value, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `reject` function is called with `reason` as an argument, which is a value that indicates the reason for the rejection. Replacing `reason` with `undefined` would result in the rejection being called with a different value, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `reject` function is called with `reason` as an argument, which
