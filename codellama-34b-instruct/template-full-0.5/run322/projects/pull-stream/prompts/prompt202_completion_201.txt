  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would return the value of the `abort` variable, while the modified code fragment `abort + 1` would return the value of the `abort` variable plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would return the value of the `abort` variable, while the modified code fragment `abort - 1` would return the value of the `abort` variable minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would return the value of the `abort` variable, while the modified code fragment `!abort` would return the negation of the value of the `abort` variable.

DONE.
