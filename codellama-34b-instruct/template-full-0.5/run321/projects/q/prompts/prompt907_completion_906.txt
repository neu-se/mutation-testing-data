  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.reverse()` would return the same array in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.splice(0, 1)` would return the same array with the first element removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(array_slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.concat(array_slice)` would return a new array that is the concatenation of the original array with itself
