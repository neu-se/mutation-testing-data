  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment 'mouse' is returned when the word ends in 'ouse', while 'mice' is returned when the word ends in 'ouse' with the new fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mat'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment 'mouse' is returned when the word ends in 'ouse', while 'mat' is returned when the word ends in 'ouse' with the new fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'house'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment 'mouse' is returned when the word ends in 'ouse', while 'house' is returned when the word ends in 'ouse' with the new fragment.

DONE.
