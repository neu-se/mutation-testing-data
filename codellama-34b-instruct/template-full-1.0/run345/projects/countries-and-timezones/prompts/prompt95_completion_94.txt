  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `!country` expression would check if the `country` variable is null or undefined, but in this modified version, it would check if the `deprecated` property of the `country` object is falsy. If the `country` object does not have a `deprecated` property, or if it is null or undefined, this modified expression would still evaluate to `true`, even if the original expression would have evaluated to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.isDeleted()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `!country` expression would check if the `country` variable is null or undefined, but in this modified version, it would call the `isDeleted()` method on the `country` object and check its return value. If the `isDeleted()` method is not implemented, or if it returns `false`, this modified expression would still evaluate to `true
