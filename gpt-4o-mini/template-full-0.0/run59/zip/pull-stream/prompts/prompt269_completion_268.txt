Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Stream ended unexpectedly'))
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of signaling the end of the stream normally, it would trigger an error callback, which could lead to unhandled errors in the consuming code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would indicate that the stream has ended but with a `null` value, which may not be handled correctly by the consumer expecting a valid data object or a specific end signal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a boolean value instead of the expected end signal, which could confuse the consumer of the stream, as it may not interpret `true` as a valid end of stream condition.

DONE.
