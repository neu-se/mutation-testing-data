  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not being applied to the `href` attribute, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not being applied to the `href` attribute, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not being applied to the `href` attribute, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

DONE.
