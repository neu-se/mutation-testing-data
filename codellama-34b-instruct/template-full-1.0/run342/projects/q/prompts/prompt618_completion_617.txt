  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation would now return a pair instead of a single value, which would likely cause unexpected results when the promise is settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation would now return an array instead of a single value, which would likely cause unexpected results when the promise is settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ key: value }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation would now return an object instead of a single value, which would likely cause unexpected results when the promise is settled.

DONE.
