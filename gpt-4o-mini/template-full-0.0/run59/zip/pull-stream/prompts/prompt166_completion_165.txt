Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `cb` would cause the `abortCb` function to receive `null` as the callback, potentially leading to a runtime error or unexpected behavior when it tries to invoke the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of `cb` would also lead to a situation where the `abortCb` function receives an undefined callback, which may cause it to fail silently or throw an error when it attempts to call the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `cb` with an empty function would mean that the abort callback does not perform any action when invoked, potentially leading to a situation where the abort signal is ignored, and the program continues executing without handling the abort condition properly.

DONE.
