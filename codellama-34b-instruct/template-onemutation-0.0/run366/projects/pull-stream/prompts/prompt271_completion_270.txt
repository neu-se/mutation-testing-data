  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `values` is a function that returns an array of values, while the new code fragment `values.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })` is a function that returns an array of values, but with each value incremented by 1. This change would cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the specific values returned by the `values` function.
