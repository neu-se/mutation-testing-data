  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a way of giving a value of `undefined` explicitly, while `null` is a distinct value. In the context of the `then` method, `undefined` would cause the promise to be fulfilled, while `null` would cause it to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a way of giving a value of `undefined` explicitly, while `undefined` is also a distinct value. In the context of the `then` method, `undefined` would cause the promise to be fulfilled, while `null` would cause it to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
DONE.
```
DONE.
