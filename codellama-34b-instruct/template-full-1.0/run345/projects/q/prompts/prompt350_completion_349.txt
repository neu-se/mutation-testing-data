  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` refers to the current object, while `null` refers to the null object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` refers to the current object, while `undefined` refers to an undefined identifier.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"self"
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is a string, while it is expected to be a reference to an object.

DONE.
