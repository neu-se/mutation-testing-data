  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for any value of `num`, even if it's not `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any value of `num`, even if it's not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any value of `num`, even if it's not `1` or `undefined`.

DONE.
