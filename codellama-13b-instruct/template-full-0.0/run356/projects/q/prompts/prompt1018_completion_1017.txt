  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is used to reject the promise with an error, while `deferred.resolve` is used to resolve the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method is used to notify the promise that it has been updated, while `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver` method is used to create a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, while `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise with an error.

DONE.
