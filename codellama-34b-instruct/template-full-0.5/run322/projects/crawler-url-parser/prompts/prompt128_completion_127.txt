  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl === "string"` would always evaluate to `false`, since `pageurl` is an object and not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.type === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.type` is a function, and `pageurl.type === "string"` would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.toString() === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.toString()` would return a string representation of the `pageurl` object, which would not be equal to the string "string".

DONE.
