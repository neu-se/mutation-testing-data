  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nmapply` method to call the `dispatch` method on the `Promise` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.post
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nmapply` method to call the `post` method on the `Promise` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.send
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nmapply` method to call the `send` method on the `Promise` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
