  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because "reject" immediately rejects the promise, while "when" waits for the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because "Q.delay(1000)" delays the promise resolution by 1 second, while "when" waits for the promise to be fulfilled immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.timeout<1000>
```
This would result in different behavior because "Q.timeout<1000>" cancels the promise if it takes more than 1 second to resolve, while "when" waits indefinitely for the promise to be fulfilled.

DONE.
