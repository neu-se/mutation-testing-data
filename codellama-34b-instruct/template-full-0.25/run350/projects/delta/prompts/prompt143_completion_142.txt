  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the iterator to skip over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the iterator to include an extra operation in the next iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the iterator to skip over the next operation or include an extra operation in the next iteration.

DONE.
