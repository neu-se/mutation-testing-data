Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow attributes from `b` to overwrite those in `a` when `a[key]` is `undefined`, which is the opposite of the original intent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] == null && b[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat both `null` and `undefined` as equivalent, allowing `b` to overwrite `a` when `a[key]` is either `null` or `undefined`, which changes the logic of the original condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== null && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the condition to pass if `a[key]` is not `null`, regardless of whether `b[key]` is `undefined`, thus potentially ignoring valid values in `b`.

DONE.
