  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return null;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would always be null, regardless of the input, whereas the original code fragment would return a promise that resolves to the value of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw new Error("Test error");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would throw an error, whereas the original code fragment would return a promise that resolves to the value of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be a rejected promise, whereas the original code fragment would return a promise that resolves to the value of the input.

DONE.
