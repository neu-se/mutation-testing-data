  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'e' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the letters "es" to the end of the word, while this new code only adds the letter "e".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ses' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the letters "es" to the end of the word, while this new code adds the letters "ses".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + ' os' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the letters "es" to the end of the word, while this new code adds the letters " os".

DONE.
