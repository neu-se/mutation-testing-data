  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and adding 1 to it would cause the iterator to skip over the next operation, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the iterator to skip over the previous operation, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the iterator to process twice as many operations, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
