 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert || otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because if `thisOp.insert` is falsy, it will use `otherOp.insert` instead, which might not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null`, which is not the same as comparing the two insert properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert ?? otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because if `thisOp.insert` is `null` or `undefined`, it will use `otherOp.insert` instead, which might not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
