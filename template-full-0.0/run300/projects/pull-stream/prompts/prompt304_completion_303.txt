  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` is a function call with arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with no arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(data)` is a function call with one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with no arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data, null)` is a function call with three arguments.

DONE.
