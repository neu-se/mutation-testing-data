  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` returns the value `true`, but `cb(false)` returns the value `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` returns the value `true`, but `cb(undefined)` returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` returns the value `true`, but `cb()` does not return any value.

DONE.
