  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `this._queue` object, which is not intended in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `this._queue` object in a different way than the original code, which is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.slice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `this._queue` object in a different way than the original code, which is not intended.

DONE.
