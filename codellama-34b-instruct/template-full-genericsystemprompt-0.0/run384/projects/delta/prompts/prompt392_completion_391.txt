  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would always return an empty operation, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would always return an operation with a length that is one more than the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would always return an operation with a length that is one less than the input.

DONE.
