  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Delta(<No params>);
```
This would result in different behavior because Delta is an abstract class and cannot be directly instantiated. Creating a new Delta with no parameters would raise a "cannot create instance of abstract class" error.  

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Delta([{insert: " "}]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original Delta constructor does not accept a string as an argument. Passing a string of dimensions will cause an error to be thrown. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Delta(() => 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original Delta constructor does not accept a function as an argument. Passing a function will cause an error to be thrown. DONE.
