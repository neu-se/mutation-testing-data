  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the property, while this replacement sets it to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the property, while this replacement gets its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hasOwnProperty", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the property, while this replacement checks if the property exists.

DONE.
