  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `reducer` function expects two arguments, `acc` and `data`, but in the original code, it is being called with `acc` and `data` in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is not being called at all. The `acc` variable is being set to the value of `data`, but the `reducer` function is not being called to update the `acc` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(data, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is being called with the arguments in the opposite order. The `reducer` function expects `acc` to be the first argument and `data` to be
