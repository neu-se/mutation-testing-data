  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `laterQueue.pop()` without any arguments, which removes and returns the last element of the array. However, passing `0` as an argument to `pop()` will remove and return the first element of the array instead, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
