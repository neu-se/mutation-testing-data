  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce()` method would start with an initial value of `prev + 1` instead of `prev`, which could cause the final result to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce()` method would start with an initial value of `prev - 1` instead of `prev`, which could cause the final result to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce()` method would start with an initial value of `prev * 2` instead of `prev`, which could cause the final result to be different.

DONE.
