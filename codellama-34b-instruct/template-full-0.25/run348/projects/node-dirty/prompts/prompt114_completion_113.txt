  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'loaded'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that listens for the `'load'` event would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that listens for the `'load'` event would not be triggered. Additionally, the code that listens for the `'error'` event would be triggered, which could cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that listens for the `'load'` event would not be triggered. Additionally, the code that listens for the `'drain'` event would be triggered, which could cause the program to continue executing even though the database has not been fully loaded.

DONE.
