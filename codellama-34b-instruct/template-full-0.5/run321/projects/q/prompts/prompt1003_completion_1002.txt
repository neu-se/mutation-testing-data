  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.length]
```
This would result in different behavior because the number of arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method is different.

DONE.
