Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, progressed, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the arguments passed to the `then` method, which may cause the progress callback to be invoked incorrectly or not at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed, void 0, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly sets the first argument of the `then` method to the progress callback, which is not intended for that position, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the `progressed` callback would mean that no progress notifications would be handled, effectively ignoring any progress updates that occur.

DONE.
