  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is a different method than `post`, and it would call the `get` method with the arguments `nodeArgs` instead of the `post` method with the arguments `nodeArgs`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because `put` is a different method than `post`, and it would call the `put` method with the arguments `nodeArgs` instead of the `post` method with the arguments `nodeArgs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"patch", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because `patch` is a different method than `post`, and it would call the `patch` method with the arguments `nodeArgs` instead of the `post` method with the arguments `nodeArgs`.

DONE.
