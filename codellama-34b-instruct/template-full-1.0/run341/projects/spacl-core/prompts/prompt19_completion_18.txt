  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(string.length < 1 || !string.endsWith('/'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the string's length is greater than 1 and if it ends with a slash, while this modified code checks if the string's length is less than 1 or if it does not end with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!string.endsWith('/*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the string ends with a slash, while this modified code checks if the string ends with a slash followed by an asterisk.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the string's length is greater than 1, while this modified code checks if the string's length is equal to 0.

DONE.
