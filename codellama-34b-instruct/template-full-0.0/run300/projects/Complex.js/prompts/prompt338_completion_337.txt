  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` would return a complex number with a real part of 1 and an imaginary part of `a`, while the modified code fragment `0, a` would return a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` would return a complex number with a real part of 1 and an imaginary part of `a`, while the modified code fragment `a, 0` would return a complex number with a real part of `a` and an imaginary part of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1, a` would return a complex number with a real part of 1 and an imaginary part of
