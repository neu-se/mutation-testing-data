  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve(args)
```
This change will cause the `promiseDispatch` function to resolve the promise with the `args` object, rather than the `promise` object. This could potentially cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than expected, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(args)
```
This change will cause the `promiseDispatch` function to reject the promise with the `args` object, rather than the `promise` object. This could potentially cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason than expected, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(args)
```
This change will cause the `promiseDispatch` function to call the `then` method on the `promise` object with the `args` object as an argument. This could
