  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return `null` instead of a country object, as the `getTimezone` function would return `null` for the invalid timezone name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"UTC"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return a country object for the "UTC" timezone, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"America/New_York"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return a country object for the "America/New_York" timezone, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
