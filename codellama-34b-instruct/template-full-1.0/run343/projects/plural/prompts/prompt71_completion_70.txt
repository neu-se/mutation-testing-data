  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "chello" is not recognized as a valid word, and the test suite would fail to pass.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the test suite is expecting the function to return "cellos" instead of "celloes" (which is the incorrect plural form).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the test suite is expecting the function to return "cellos" instead of "cello1" (which is a concatenation of the original word and a number, resulting in a nonsensical plural form).

DONE.
