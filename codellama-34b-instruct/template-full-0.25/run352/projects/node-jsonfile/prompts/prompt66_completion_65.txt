  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0000/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a null character (U+0000) instead of a byte order mark (U+FEFF).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFFFE/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a non-character (U+FFFE) instead of a byte order mark (U+FEFF).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the byte order mark (U+FEFF) globally instead of just once.

DONE.
