  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object or null, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is not an object and not null. This change would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error if `b` is not an object, even if it is not null.
