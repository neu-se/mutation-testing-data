  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not include the query string in the parsed URL object, which could cause issues if the URL contains query parameters that are important for the application's functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return `null` if the input string is not a valid URL, which could cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return `undefined` if the input string is not a valid URL, which could cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
