  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter passed to `buildCountry` is different, which could cause the function to return a different country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter passed to `buildCountry` is different, which could cause the function to return a different country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter passed to `buildCountry` is different, which could cause the function to return a different country object.

DONE.
