  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be different than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be different than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be different than the original code.

DONE.
