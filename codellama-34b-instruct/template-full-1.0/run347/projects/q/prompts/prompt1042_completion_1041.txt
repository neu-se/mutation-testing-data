  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.get(1)` would return the second element of the array, while the original code fragment would return the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get(ends.promise.length-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.get(ends.promise.length-1)` would return the last element of the array, while the original code fragment would return the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get(Math.random()*ends.promise.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.get(Math.random()*ends.promise.length)` would return a random element of the array, while the original code fragment would return the first element.

DONE.
