  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is always `undefined`, whereas `object` could be any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `object`, and could lead to different errors or behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"object"` is a string value, whereas `object` could be any value.

DONE.
