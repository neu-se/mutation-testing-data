  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that reads the entire file contents into memory, whereas `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that reads the file contents asynchronously and returns a promise. Using `fs.readFileSync` could potentially cause the application to block or hang if the file size is too large.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the execution of the synchronous `fs.readFileSync` function, which would block the event loop and prevent any other JavaScript code from executing until the file has been completely read. This could potentially cause the application to become unresponsive or hang.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the execution of the synchronous `fs.writeFileSync` function
