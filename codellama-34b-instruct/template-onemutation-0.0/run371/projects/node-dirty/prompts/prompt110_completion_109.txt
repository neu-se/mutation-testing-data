  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs. Using `end` instead of `error` would cause the `load` event to be emitted with the wrong number of rows, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.
