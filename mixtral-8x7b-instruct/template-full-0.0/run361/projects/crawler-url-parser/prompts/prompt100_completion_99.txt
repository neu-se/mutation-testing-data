 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl['url']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `url` property as a string key instead of using dot notation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.toString().url
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to convert the entire `currentUrl` object to a string and then access the `url` property, which would result in `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `path` property instead of the `url` property, which could lead to incorrect URL matching in the `extract` function.

DONE.
