  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `s instanceof Function` is a more strict check than `typeof s === 'function'`, as it checks that `s` is an instance of the `Function` constructor, whereas `typeof s === 'function'` only checks that `s` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.constructor === Function` checks that `s` is an instance of the `Function` constructor, whereas `typeof s === 'function'` only checks that `s` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(s) === '[object Function]'
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(s)` returns a string representation of the object, and `typeof s === 'function'` only checks that `s` is a function.

DONE.
