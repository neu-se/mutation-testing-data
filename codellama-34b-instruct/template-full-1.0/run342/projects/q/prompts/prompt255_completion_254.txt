  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the `messages` variable and always use the `newPromise` value, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected unnecessarily.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with a new error, even if the `messages` variable has a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(message)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with a new value, even if the `messages` variable has a valid value.

DONE.
