  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to iterate over the entire `diffResult` array, even if the `thisIter` and `otherIter` iterators have already reached the end of their respective arrays. This would cause the loop to access and manipulate elements that are outside the bounds of the arrays, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to iterate over the entire `diffResult` array, even if the `thisIter` and `otherIter` iterators have already reached the end of their respective arrays. This would cause the loop to access and manipulate elements that are outside the bounds of the arrays,
