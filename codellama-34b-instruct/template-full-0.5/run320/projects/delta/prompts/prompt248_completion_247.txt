  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff algorithm to skip the first character of the next op, potentially leading to a mismatch between the two strings being compared.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff algorithm to include an extra character from the current op, potentially leading to a mismatch between the two strings being compared.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff algorithm to use the length of the next op in the other delta, potentially leading to a mismatch between the two strings being compared.

DONE.
