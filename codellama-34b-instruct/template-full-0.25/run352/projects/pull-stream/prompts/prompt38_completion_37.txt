  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument is now `ref[4]`, which is not the same as `ref[3]` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third and fourth arguments are swapped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument is now `ref[3] + 1`, which is not the same as `ref[3]` in the original code.

DONE.
