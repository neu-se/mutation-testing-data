  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the complex number itself, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the real part of the complex number, which may not be intended.

DONE.
