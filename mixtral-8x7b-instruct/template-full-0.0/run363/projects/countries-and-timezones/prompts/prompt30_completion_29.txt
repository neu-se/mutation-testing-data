 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(num / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always round down to the nearest hour, even if the minutes are greater than 30. The original `getNumStr` function converts the input to an absolute value and then formats it with a leading zero if it's less than 10.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`${sign}${hours}:${min < 10 ? '0' + min : min}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a leading zero to the minutes only if they are less than 10, instead of using the `getNumStr` function which formats the number correctly with a leading zero if needed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`${sign}${(hours * 60) + min}:00`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the hours and minutes to a
