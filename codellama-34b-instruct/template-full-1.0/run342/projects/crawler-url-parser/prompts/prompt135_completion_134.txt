  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor` function is being added to the code, which would cause the `replace` function to always return an integer value, whereas the original code would return a string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace("default"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is being changed from `/\/[^\/]*[\/]?$/` to `/default/`, which would cause the `replace` function to only match the "default" substring in the input string, whereas the original code would match any non-empty substring that ends with "/".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\1/"));
```
This would result in different behavior because
