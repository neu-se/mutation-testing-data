  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, so the event would not be handled correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, so the event would not be handled correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"handledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, so the event would not be handled correctly.

DONE.
