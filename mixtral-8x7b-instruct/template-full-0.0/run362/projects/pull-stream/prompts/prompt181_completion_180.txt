 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function passed in as an argument is not being called, which is different from the original behavior of invoking `onAbort` when the `abort` flag is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` callback will receive `null` instead of the `onAbort` function, which might cause unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error('onAbort called') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` callback will throw an error instead of invoking the `onAbort` function, which might cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
