  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `zipArchive.glob()` on the `src` string, while this modified code fragment calls it on each part of the `src` string that is separated by commas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart, {});
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any options to the `zipArchive.glob()` method, while this modified code fragment passes an empty object as options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart, {
        ignore: ['node_modules/**'],
    });
});
```
This would
