 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the new value returned by the function would be the numeric sum of the `s` variable and 1, instead of the original value of the `s` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof s
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return a string indicating the type of the `s` variable, instead of the original value of the `s` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s !== s
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `false`, since the expression `s !== s` is never true.

By introducing these changes, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite in catching potential issues in the code. If none of the tests fail after applying these mutations, it may indicate that the test suite is not comprehensive enough and could benefit from additional tests.

DONE.
