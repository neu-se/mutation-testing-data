  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function expects a non-null value as its first argument, but passing `null` would cause it to return `undefined`, which would then be memoized as `countries[id]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function expects an object with a specific shape as its first argument, but passing an empty object would cause it to return a different value, which would then be memoized as `countries[id]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.countries.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function expects an array of strings as its first argument, but passing a copy of the `data.countries` array would cause it to return a different value, which would then be memoized as `countries[id]`.

DONE.
