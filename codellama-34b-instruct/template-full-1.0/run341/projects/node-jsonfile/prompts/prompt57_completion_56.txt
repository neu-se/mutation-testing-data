  Thank you for the code sample. I'll do my best to help you with mutation testing and provide you with three possible code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the `stringify` function, along with brief explanations of how they would result in different behavior.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
str.replace(/[^\n]/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/[^\n]/g` pattern matches any character that is not a newline, rather than matching all newlines as the original pattern does. This would cause the `stringify` function to replace all characters that are not newline characters with the specified `EOL` character, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
str.replace(/[^]/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/[^]/g` pattern matches any character, regardless of whether it is a newline or not. This would cause the `stringify` function to replace all characters with the specified `EOL`
