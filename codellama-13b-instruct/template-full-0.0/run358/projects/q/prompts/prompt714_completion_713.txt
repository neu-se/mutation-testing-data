  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.keys` method is not defined in the original code, but it is defined in the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.all` method is not defined in the original code, but it is defined in the `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.any` method is not defined in the original code, but it is defined in the `Q` object.

DONE.
