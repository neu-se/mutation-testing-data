  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return the first character of the word instead of the last character, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return the second-to-last character of the word instead of the last character, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return the third-to-last character of the word instead of the last character, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
