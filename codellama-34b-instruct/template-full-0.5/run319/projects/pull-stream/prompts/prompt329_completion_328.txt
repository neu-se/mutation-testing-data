  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `op`, which would change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the value of `op`, which would also change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `op` by 2, which would change the output of the function.

DONE.
