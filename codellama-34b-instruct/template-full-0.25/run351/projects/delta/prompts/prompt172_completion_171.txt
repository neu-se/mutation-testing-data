  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation in the other delta, rather than the current delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation in the current delta, plus one, rather than the actual length of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation in the other delta, minus one, rather than the actual length of the operation.

DONE.
