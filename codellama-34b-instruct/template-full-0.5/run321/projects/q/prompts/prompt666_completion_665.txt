  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with a different argument, which could lead to a different execution path or result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with a different argument, which could lead to a different execution path or result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with a different argument, which could lead to a different execution path or result.

DONE.
