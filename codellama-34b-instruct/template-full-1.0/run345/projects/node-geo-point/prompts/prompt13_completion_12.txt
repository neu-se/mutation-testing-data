  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates && point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `point.coordinates` is an array with a length of 2, while this new code fragment checks whether `point.coordinates` is truthy and whether `point.coordinates[0]` is defined. If `point.coordinates` is an empty array, the original code fragment would return `true`, but this new code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.coordinates || point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `point.coordinates` is an array with a length of 2, while this new code fragment checks whether `point.coordinates` is falsy or whether `point.coordinates.length` is less than 2. If `point.coordinates` is an empty array, the original code fragment would return `false`, but this new code fragment would
