  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the value, potentially causing the `isPromiseAlike` function to return `false` when it should return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of the variable, potentially causing the `isPromiseAlike` function to return `false` when it should return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method would return a string representation of the value, potentially causing the `isPromiseAlike` function to return `false` when it should return `true`.

DONE.
