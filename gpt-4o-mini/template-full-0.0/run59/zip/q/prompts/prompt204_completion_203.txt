Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber("unknownFile:123:456");
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly passes a string instead of using the stack line from the error, which may lead to incorrect file name and line number extraction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the function to return `undefined`, which would skip the assignment of `qFileName` and the line number, potentially leading to unfiltered stack traces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(lines[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the first line of the stack trace instead of the relevant line, which may not contain the correct file name and line number, leading to inaccurate filtering of stack traces.

DONE.
