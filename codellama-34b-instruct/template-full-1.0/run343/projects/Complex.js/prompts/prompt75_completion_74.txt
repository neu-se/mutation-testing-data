  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, and the rest of the code would execute differently as a result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 2 instead of 0, and the rest of the code would execute differently as a result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at -1 instead of 0, and the rest of the code would execute differently as a result. 

DONE.
