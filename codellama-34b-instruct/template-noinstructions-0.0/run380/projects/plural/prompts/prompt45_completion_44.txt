  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applied the rule to words that end in "o", while this new code fragment applies the rule to all words that end in a vowel followed by "o".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applied the rule to words that end in "o" and do not start with a vowel, while this new code fragment applies the rule to all words that end in "o" and do not start with a vowel.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
