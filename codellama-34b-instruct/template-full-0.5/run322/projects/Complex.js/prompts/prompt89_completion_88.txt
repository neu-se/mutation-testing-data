  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` rounds the number towards zero, whereas `parseFloat` returns the number as a floating-point number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` returns a number object, whereas `parseFloat` returns a number primitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds the number up, whereas `parseFloat` returns the number as is.

DONE.
