  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if `pageurl` has a length greater than 0. If `pageurl` is a string, it will always have a length greater than 0, so the behavior of the function will be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.indexOf("http") === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if `pageurl` starts with "http". If `pageurl` is a string that starts with "http", the behavior of the function will be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.match(/^https?:\/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this
