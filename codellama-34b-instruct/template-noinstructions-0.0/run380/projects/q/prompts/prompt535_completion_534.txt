  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to `spread` is reversed, which could cause the callbacks to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would never be called, which could cause the promise to never be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` callback would never be called, which could cause the promise to never be fulfilled.

DONE.
