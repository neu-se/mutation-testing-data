 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned length would be multiplied by 2, which could cause incorrect calculations in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` returns the total number of elements in the iterable, while `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation. This could cause incorrect calculations in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random float between 0 and 1, which is not a valid length. This would cause an error in the `compose` method.

DONE.
