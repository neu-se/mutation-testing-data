  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'ftp:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the protocol is not 'ftp:', which is not checked in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:' && parsedUrl.hostname != 'localhost'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the hostname is not 'localhost', which is not checked in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:' && parsedUrl.port != 80
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the port is not 80, which is not checked in the
