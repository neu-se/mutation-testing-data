  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `noop`, which means it does nothing and does not throw any errors. The new code fragment throws an error with a message that includes the last error message, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.
