  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is not a valid event listener, and it would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would be called instead of the `reject` function, and it would not cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called instead of the `resolve` function, and it would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
