  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw a `SyntaxError` when attempting to parse a null or undefined value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw a `SyntaxError` when attempting to parse an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would return an empty object when attempting to parse an empty object literal.

DONE.
