  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not called, and the promise is never resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a `null` value, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with the `deferred.promise` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected with the same value as the `deferred.promise` object.

DONE.
