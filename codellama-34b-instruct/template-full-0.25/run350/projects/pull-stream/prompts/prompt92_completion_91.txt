  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.length` is a different value than `data`, and the test may not be able to handle this difference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `data + 1` is a different value than `data`, and the test may not be able to handle this difference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.slice(1)` is a different value than `data`, and the test may not be able to handle this difference.

DONE.
