  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would not iterate over the object's properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would not iterate over the object's properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would not iterate over the object's properties.

DONE.
