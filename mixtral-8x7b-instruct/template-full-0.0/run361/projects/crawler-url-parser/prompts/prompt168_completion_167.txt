 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.indexOf(linkurl_path) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `pageurl_path` contains `linkurl_path` as a substring, rather than checking if `linkurl_path` is a prefix of `pageurl_path`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `pageurl_path` starts with `linkurl_path`, which is more restrictive than checking if `linkurl_path` is a prefix of `pageurl_path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.search(linkurl_path) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a regular expression search to check if `pageurl_path` starts with `linkurl_path`, which is more permiss
