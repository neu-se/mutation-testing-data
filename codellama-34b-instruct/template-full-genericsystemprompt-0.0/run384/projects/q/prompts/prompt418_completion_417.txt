  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with a `state` property that can be either "fulfilled" or "rejected", and the original code fragment checks for "fulfilled" state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with a `value` property that contains the fulfillment value, and the original code fragment checks for the presence of a fulfillment value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.reason === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with a `reason` property that contains the rejection reason, and the original code fragment checks for the presence of a rejection reason.

DONE.
