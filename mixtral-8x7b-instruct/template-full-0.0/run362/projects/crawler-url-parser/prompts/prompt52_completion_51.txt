 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'..'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve relative paths using the parent directory, instead of the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve relative paths using the current directory, instead of the base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve relative paths using an explicit reference to the current directory, instead of the base URL.

These changes would test the robustness of the code in handling different forms of relative path resolution, which is an important aspect of URL parsing and manipulation. DONE.
