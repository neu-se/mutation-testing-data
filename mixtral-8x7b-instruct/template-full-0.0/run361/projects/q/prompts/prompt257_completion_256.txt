 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(value).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is not a function in the Q library, and this would cause a test failure if the test suite checks for the correct resolution value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called immediately, instead of being passed as a callback to the `resolver` function. This could cause the promise to be resolved with an incorrect value or at an incorrect time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called immediately, instead of being passed as a callback to the `resolver` function. This could cause the promise to be rejected with an incorrect reason or at an incorrect time.

DONE.
