  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the callback function onto the `cbs` array, but it would not execute the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the result of calling the callback function onto the `cbs` array, rather than the callback function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb, cb());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push both the callback function and the result of calling the callback function onto the `cbs` array.

DONE.
