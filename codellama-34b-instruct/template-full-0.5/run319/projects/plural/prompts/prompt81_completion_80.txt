Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a syntax error due to the missing closing quotation mark.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a syntax error due to the missing closing quotation mark.
