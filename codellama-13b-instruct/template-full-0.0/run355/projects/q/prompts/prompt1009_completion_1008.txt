```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be attempting to access the second element of the `arguments` array, which does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be attempting to access the third element of the `arguments` array, which does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
