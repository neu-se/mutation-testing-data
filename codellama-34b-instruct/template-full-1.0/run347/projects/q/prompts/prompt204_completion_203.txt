  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return null;
```
This would result in a null reference error when the function is called, as the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return fileNameAndLineNumber[1]++;
```
This would result in a different line number being returned, which could cause the stack trace to be incorrectly generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return fileNameAndLineNumber[1]--;
```
This would result in a different line number being returned, which could cause the stack trace to be incorrectly generated.

DONE.
