  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value, which would affect the behavior of `object_hasOwnProperty` when it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a specific `this` value and arguments provided individually, which would affect the behavior of `object_hasOwnProperty` when it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a specific `this` value and arguments provided as an array, which would affect the behavior of `object_hasOwnProperty` when it is called.

DONE.
