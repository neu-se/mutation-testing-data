  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.concat(["new_illness"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new element to the array, which would cause the plural function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the array, which would cause the plural function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the plural function to return a different result.

DONE.
