  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 + 540) % 360 - 180
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it adds 540 to the longitude before taking the modulo 360, which can result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 + 360) % 360 - 180
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it adds 360 to the longitude before taking the modulo 360, which can result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 + 180) % 360 - 180
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it adds 180 to the longitude before taking the modulo 360, which can result in a different output.

DONE.
