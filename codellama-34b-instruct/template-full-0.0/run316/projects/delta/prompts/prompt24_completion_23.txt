  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `a` instead of `b`, which could lead to unexpected results in the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `b[key]`, which could lead to unexpected results in the `diff` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `b[key]` by 2, which could lead to unexpected results in the `diff` function.

DONE.
