  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone with the given name, rather than building a new timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[name].name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the timezone, rather than the timezone object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[name].offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the offset of the timezone, rather than the timezone object itself.

DONE.
