  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This code fragment will match any string that starts with a `#` character, which is different from the original code fragment that matches any string that ends with a `#` character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This code fragment will match any string that contains a `#` character, which is different from the original code fragment that matches any string that ends with a `#` character. The `g` flag at the end of the regex makes it match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/i
```
This code fragment will match any string that starts with a `#` character, which is different from the original code fragment that matches any string that ends with a `#` character. The `i` flag at the end of the regex makes it case-insensitive, so it will match strings that start with either `#` or `?
