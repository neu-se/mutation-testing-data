Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the current operation from `thisIter` instead of the newly created operation `newOp`, potentially altering the resulting delta by including an unexpected operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes one operation from the delta instead of adding a new operation, which could lead to loss of data and incorrect delta composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it retains one unit of text instead of pushing a new operation, which may cause the delta to incorrectly represent the intended changes between the two deltas.

DONE.
