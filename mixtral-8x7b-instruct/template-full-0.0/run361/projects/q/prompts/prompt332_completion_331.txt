 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the result of the `promiseDispatch` method, while this change resolves the promise with the original `result` value. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `result` value is not the final value that should be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the result of the `promiseDispatch` method, while this change rejects the promise with the `result` value. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `result` value is not an error object or if the developers expect the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw result;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves or rejects the promise with the result
