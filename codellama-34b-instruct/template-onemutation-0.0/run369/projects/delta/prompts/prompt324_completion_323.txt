  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to decrease by the length of the current operation, rather than increase. This would cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the `base` delta, potentially leading to incorrect results in the `invert` method.

DONE.
