  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `resolve` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause the promise to be rejected with the specified error, whereas `resolve` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "something else"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with the specified value, whereas `resolve` would cause it to be fulfilled with the original value.

DONE.
