  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` has a higher precedence than the division operator `/`, so the expression `a * b / d` would be evaluated as `a * (b / d)` instead of `(a * b) / d`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator `+` has a higher precedence than the division operator `/`, so the expression `a + b / d` would be evaluated as `a + (b / d)` instead of `(a + b) / d`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator `-` has a higher precedence than the division operator `/`, so the expression `a - b / d` would be evaluated as `a - (b / d)` instead of `(a - b) / d`.

DONE.
