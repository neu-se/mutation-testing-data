  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method expects a callback function as an argument, but `1` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method expects a callback function that takes no arguments, but the function provided here takes no arguments and does nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(function(err) {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method expects a callback function that takes an error object as an argument, but the function provided here takes no arguments and does nothing.

DONE.
