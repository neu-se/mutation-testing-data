  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would still match words that end with "o", but the replacement function would now also add an "s" to words that end with "s", resulting in duplicates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would still match words that end with "o", but the replacement function would now add "es" to pluralize words that end with "o", regardless of whether the word is a noun or a verb.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'os' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would now
