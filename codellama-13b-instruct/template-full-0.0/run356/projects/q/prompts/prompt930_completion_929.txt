  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `this` object, while the new code fragment refers to the `this.foo` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `this` object, while the new code fragment refers to the `this.bar` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.baz
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `this` object, while the new code fragment refers to the `this.baz` property.

DONE.
