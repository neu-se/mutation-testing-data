  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abs = this['abs'](a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method is being called on the `a` argument, rather than on the `Complex` object itself. This could cause the method to return a different result, leading to changes in the `z` variable and potentially different behavior in the rest of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abs = this['abs'](a + b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method is being called on the sum of `a` and `b`, rather than on the `Complex` object itself. This could cause the method to return a different result, leading to changes in the `z` variable and potentially different behavior in the rest of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abs = Math.abs(a - b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` method is being used instead of the
