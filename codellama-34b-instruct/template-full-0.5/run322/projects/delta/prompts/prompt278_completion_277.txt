  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, start);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for the newline character in the string, and if it is found, it would return the index of the first occurrence of the newline character, which may not be the same as the index of the newline character that is being searched for.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = thisOp.insert.lastIndexOf(newline, start);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for the newline character in the string, and if it is found, it would return the index of the last occurrence of the newline character, which may not be the same as the index of the newline character that is being searched for.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, start) + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for the newline character in the string
