  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return an empty delta instead of a delta with the contents of `other`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a delta with the contents of `other` twice instead of just once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a delta with the contents of `other` in reverse order instead of in the original order.

DONE.
