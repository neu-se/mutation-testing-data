  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER in the complex.js code can be replaced with:
``` ruby
0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the number zero, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER in the complex.js code can be replaced with:
``` ruby
1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the number one, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER in the complex.js code can be replaced with:
``` ruby
NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the value NaN (Not a Number), regardless of the input.

DONE.
