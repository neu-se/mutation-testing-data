  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of `path` and `ctx` would produce a different result than the original code fragment, which accesses the `path` and `ctx` properties in a different way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `path` property of the `ctx` object instead of the `path` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path[ctx]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would index the `path` array with the `ctx` object instead of the `path` and `ctx` properties.

DONE.
