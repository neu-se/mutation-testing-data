  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || point.type !== 'LineString'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the type is not equal to 'LineString', which would cause the function to throw an error even if the type is 'Point'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.type !== 'LineString'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the type is not equal to 'Point' and not equal to 'LineString', which would cause the function to throw an error only if the type is neither 'Point' nor 'LineString'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || point.type !== 'LineString' || point.type !== 'Polygon'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the type is not equal to 'Point', 'LineString', or 'Polygon', which would cause the function to
