Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `rest` method to return the entire slice of operations starting from the current index even when there is an offset, potentially leading to incorrect results when the offset is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if the index is at the start of the operations array, which would incorrectly allow the method to return all operations even if there are operations that should be skipped due to a non-zero offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `rest` method to return the remaining operations even when the index is greater than zero, which could lead to returning operations that should not be included based on the current state of the iterator.

DONE.
