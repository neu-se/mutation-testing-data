  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' in the chunk is equal to -1, which means the chunk does not contain a newline character. The modified code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' in the chunk is greater than -1, which means the chunk contains at least one newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.includes('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' in the chunk is equal to -1, which means the chunk does not contain a newline character. The modified code fragment checks if the chunk includes the substring '\n', which means the chunk contains at least one newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf('\n') > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last index of '\
