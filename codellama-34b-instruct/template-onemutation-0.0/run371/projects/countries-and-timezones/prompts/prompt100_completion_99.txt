  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the `tzs` object, while `tzs` itself is an object. In the original code, `tzs` is used as an object, and `Object.keys(tzs)` would return an array of strings representing the keys of the `tzs` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
