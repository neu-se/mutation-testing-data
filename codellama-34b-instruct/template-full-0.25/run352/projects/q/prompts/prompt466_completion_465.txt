  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when `atReport` is not `-1`, even if `reportedUnhandledRejections` does not contain `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `promise` is in `reportedUnhandledRejections` instead of checking if it is at the same index as `promise` in `unhandledRejections`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `promise` is in `unhandledRejections` instead of checking if it is at the same index as `promise` in `reportedUnhandledRejections`.

DONE.
