  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call the `callback` function with the `arguments` object as the argument list, which would cause the function to be called with the original arguments, rather than the modified arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call the `callback` function with the `arguments` object as the argument list, which would cause the function to be called with the original arguments, rather than the modified arguments.

DONE.
