  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, whereas the `==` operator only checks for value equality. In this case, `tokens` is an array, and `undefined` is a primitive value, so the `===` operator would return `false`, while the `==` operator would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is a number, and `0` is a number, so the `===` operator would return `true`, while the `==` operator would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is a number, and `undefined` is a primitive value, so the `===` operator would return `false`, while the
