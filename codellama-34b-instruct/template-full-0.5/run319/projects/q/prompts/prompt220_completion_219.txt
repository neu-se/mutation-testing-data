  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set to the string `"true"` instead of checking if it is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG === "true"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set to the string `"true"` instead of checking if it is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is defined, regardless of its value.

DONE.
