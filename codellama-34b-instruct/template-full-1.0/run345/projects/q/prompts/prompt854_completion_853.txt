  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function will always clear the `timeoutId` timer, even if it has already been cleared or never set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function will throw a `TypeError` if it is called with a non-numeric value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var timeoutId = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeoutId` variable would have a different value than the `timeoutId` variable in the original code, causing the `clearTimeout` function to clear the wrong timer.

DONE.
