  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, while the new code fragment uses `2 * a`, which is twice the value of `a`. This change would cause the `cosh` function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, while the new code fragment uses `a + b`, which is the sum of `a` and `b`. This change would cause the `cosh` function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, while the new code fragment uses `a * b`, which is the product of `a` and `b`. This change would cause the
