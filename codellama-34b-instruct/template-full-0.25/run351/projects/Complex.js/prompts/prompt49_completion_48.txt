  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` would always return `true` if the argument is a number, regardless of whether it is finite or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` would return `true` if the argument is `NaN`, but `false` for any other value, including finite numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isSafeInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isSafeInteger` would return `true` if the argument is a safe integer (i.e., an integer that can be exactly represented as a double), but `false` for any other value, including finite numbers.

DONE.
