Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the first value of the object `b` instead of the first key, which could lead to mismatched comparisons if the structure of `b` is not as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the embed type with the length of the keys in `b`, which will always be a number, leading to a type mismatch in the error message and potentially incorrect logic flow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the embed type of `a` with itself instead of comparing it to the embed type of `b`, which would always evaluate to true and bypass the error handling for mismatched embed types.

DONE.
