  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(this["re"] - z["re"], this["im"] + z["im"]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the constructor is called with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(this["re"] * z["re"], this["im"] * z["im"]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the constructor is called with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(this["re"] * z["re"], this["im"] - z["im"]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the constructor is called with different arguments.

DONE.
