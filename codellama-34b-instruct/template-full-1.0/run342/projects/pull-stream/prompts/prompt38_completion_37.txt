  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument is now `ref[4]`, which is undefined, instead of `ref[3]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], s[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument is now `s[3]`, which is undefined, instead of `ref[3]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument is now `ref[0]`, which is the first argument, instead of `ref[3]`.

DONE.
