  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `Promise.reject`, which will create a rejected promise, but `Promise.resolve` will create a resolved promise, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('The options.url is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `return Promise.reject(new Error('The options.url is required'))`, which will create a rejected promise with the error message, but the new code fragment will throw an exception with the error message, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return request(options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `return Promise.reject(new Error('The options.url is required'))`, which will create a rejected promise with the error message, but the new code fragment will call the `
