  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['NAN'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if `this` or `z` is infinite and returns NaN if either is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['INFINITY'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` and `z` are both infinite, while this new code checks if `this` or `z` is infinite and returns Infinity if either is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()) {
  return Complex['ZERO'];
}
```
This would result in different
