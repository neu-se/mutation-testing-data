  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended, !cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!cb` would negate the callback function, causing the `read` function to be called with a different set of arguments than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` and `ended` arguments would be swapped, causing the `read` function to be called with a different set of arguments than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` would be passed as the second argument to the `read` function, causing it to be called with a different set of arguments than expected.

DONE.
