  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 180 - bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite direction of the original bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same direction as the original bearing, but shifted by 180 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
360 - bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite direction of the original bearing, but shifted by 360 degrees.

DONE.
