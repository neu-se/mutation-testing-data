  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) => test(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `test` function with `data` as an argument, while the replaced code calls the `test` function with `null` as an argument. This could potentially cause the `test` function to return a different result, which could in turn cause the `cb` function to be called with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) => test(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `test` function with `data` as an argument, while the replaced code calls the `test` function with `1` as an argument. This could potentially cause the `test` function to return a different result, which could in turn cause the `cb` function to be called with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) => test()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
