  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key).toLowerCase();
```
This would result in different behavior because the toLowerCase() method would convert the value stored at key to lowercase, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the has() method returns a boolean indicating whether the key is present in the Map, not the value stored at that key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.entries();
```
This would result in different behavior because the entries() method returns an iterator over the keys and values of the Map, not the value stored at a specific key.

DONE.
