  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `abort` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator evaluates to `false` if either operand is `false`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator evaluates to `true` if either operand is `true`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `abort` is `false`.

DONE.
