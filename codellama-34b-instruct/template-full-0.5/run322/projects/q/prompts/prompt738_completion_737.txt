  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a rejected promise, whereas `Q.resolve` creates a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise, whereas `Q.resolve` creates a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().reject` creates a rejected promise, whereas `Q.resolve` creates a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
