 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise, it would be resolved with the exception as the value. This could cause tests to pass even when they should fail due to unhandled exceptions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { throw new Error('Replacement error') }
