  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a minus sign instead of a plus sign. This could potentially cause the `sqrt` method to return incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r * a)
```
This code fragment is a multiplication of `r` and `a`, which could potentially cause the `sqrt` method to return incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r / a)
```
This code fragment is a division of `r` by `a`, which could potentially cause the `sqrt` method to return incorrect results in certain cases.

DONE.
