  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be used as the policy instead of the actual policy object, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` for any input, regardless of the policy's contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be used as the policy instead of the actual policy object, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` for any input, regardless of the policy's contents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, new Policy()
```
This would result in different behavior because a new, empty policy object would be used instead of the actual policy object, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` for any input, regardless of the policy's contents.

DONE.
