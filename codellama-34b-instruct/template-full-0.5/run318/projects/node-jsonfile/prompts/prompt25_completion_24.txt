  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `content` string with an empty string, which would change the resulting JSON object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `content` string to uppercase, which would change the resulting JSON object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split(',').join('|')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `content` string on commas and join it back together with pipes, which would change the resulting JSON object.

DONE.
