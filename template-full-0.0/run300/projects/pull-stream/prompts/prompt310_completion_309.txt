  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the result of the `test` function, which means that the `if` statement would be executed even if the `test` function returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with the `data` argument, which is not the same as the original code where the `test` function is called with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with an additional `true` argument, which is not the same as the original code where the `test` function is called with no arguments.

DONE.
