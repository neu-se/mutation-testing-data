  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val, row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value to itself, regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value to undefined, regardless of the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value to null, regardless of the input value.

DONE.
