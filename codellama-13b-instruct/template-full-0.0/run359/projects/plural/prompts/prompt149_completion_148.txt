  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would not be added to the `String.prototype` object, which would cause the `plural` function to not be available on strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would not be added to the `String.prototype` object, which would cause the `plural` function to not be available on strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would not be added to the `String.prototype` object, which would cause the `plural` function to not be available on strings.

DONE.
