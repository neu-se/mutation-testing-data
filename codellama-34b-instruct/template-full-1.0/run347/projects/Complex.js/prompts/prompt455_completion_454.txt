  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` negates the boolean value of `this['isNaN']`, which means that the function would return `false` instead of `true` if the complex number is not on the Riemann sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Boolean(this['isNaN'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Boolean()` converts its argument to a truthy or falsy value. In this case, it would return `true` if the complex number is not on the Riemann sphere, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] || this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the real or imaginary part of the complex number is not zero, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
