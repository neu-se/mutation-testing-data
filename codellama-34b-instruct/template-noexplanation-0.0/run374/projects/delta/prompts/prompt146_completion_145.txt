  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This will cause the iterator to advance by one step, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This will cause the iterator to advance by two steps, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(3)
```
This will cause the iterator to advance by three steps, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
