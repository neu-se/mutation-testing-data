  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the cosine of the input instead of the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the tangent of the input instead of the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the hyperbolic cosine of the input instead of the expected result.

DONE.
