  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasStacks = Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `hasStacks` property to always be `false`, which would skip the `try`/`catch` block and prevent the error from being caught.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasStacks = !Q.longStackSupport || !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `hasStacks` property to always be `true`, which would cause the `try`/`catch` block to always be executed, regardless of whether or not the error was caught.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasStacks = Q.longStackSupport && typeof hasStacks !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `hasStacks` property to be `undefined` if `Q.longStackSupport` is falsy, which would cause the
