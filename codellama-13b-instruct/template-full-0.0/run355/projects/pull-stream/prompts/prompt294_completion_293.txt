  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with an error argument if the `ended` variable is true, but this code fragment always calls the callback function with both an error and data argument. This could cause issues if the callback function is not designed to handle both arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with an error argument if the `ended` variable is true, but this code fragment always calls the callback function with an error argument.
