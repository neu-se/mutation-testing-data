Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the arguments instead of the actual `args`, potentially causing the function to not receive the expected parameters and leading to incorrect behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the context (`thisp`), which could lead to unexpected results if the function relies on the correct context for execution, potentially causing it to operate on the global object instead of the intended object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0], args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first element of `args` as the context (`thisp`), which may not be the intended object, and could lead to incorrect behavior if the function expects a specific object as its context.

DONE.
