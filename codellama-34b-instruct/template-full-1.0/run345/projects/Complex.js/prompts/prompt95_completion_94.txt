  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the imaginary parts of both complex numbers, instead of the real parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the imaginary parts of `z` from the imaginary parts of `this`, instead of adding them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the real parts of `z` from the real parts of `this`, instead of adding them.

DONE.
