  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the `Promise` object instead of the `timeout` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be resolved immediately instead of waiting for the `timeout` to expire.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be resolved immediately instead of waiting for the `timeout` to expire.

DONE.
