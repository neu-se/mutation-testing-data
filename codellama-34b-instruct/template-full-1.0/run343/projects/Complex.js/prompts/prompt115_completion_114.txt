  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1 / a` operation would always return `1`, regardless of the value of `a`. In contrast, the original code fragment `a` simply returns the value of `a`, which may be different from `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` operation would always return `a + 1`, regardless of the value of `a`. In contrast, the original code fragment `a` simply returns the value of `a`, which may be different from `a + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * 2` operation would always return `2a`, regardless of the value of `a`. In contrast, the original code fragment `a` simply returns the value of `a`, which may be different from `2a
