  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject()` method returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `Q.fbind()` method to return a rejected promise, even if the original promise was resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve()` method returns a resolved promise, which would cause the `Q.fbind()` method to return a resolved promise, even if the original promise was rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer()` method returns a deferred promise, which would cause the `Q.fbind()` method to return a deferred promise, even if the original promise was resolved or rejected.

DONE.
