 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a fixed base URL instead of using the provided `baseUrlStr`. This could lead to incorrect URL parsing if the actual base URL is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `url` property of the `baseUrl` object, which might not be initialized or might have a different value than the original `baseUrlStr`. This could lead to incorrect URL parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random().toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random string instead of using the provided `baseUrlStr`. This would cause the URL parsing to fail, as the generated string is not a valid URL.

DONE.
