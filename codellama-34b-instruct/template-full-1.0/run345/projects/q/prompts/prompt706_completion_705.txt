  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method of the `Array` prototype, and replacing it with `null` would cause a `TypeError` when attempting to invoke it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method of the `Array` prototype, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` when attempting to invoke it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[object Object]
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method of the `Array` prototype, and replacing it with an object would cause a `TypeError` when attempting to invoke it.

DONE.
