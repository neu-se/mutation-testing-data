  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the plural form of the word, regardless of the number passed in.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the singular form of the word, regardless of the number passed in.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the plural form of the word, but with a negative number, which would be an invalid input.

DONE.
