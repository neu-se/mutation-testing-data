  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.get(key)` would return the value associated with the key `key` in the `this._data` map, whereas `key` would return the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.get(key + 1)` would return the value associated with the key `key + 1` in the `this._data` map, whereas `key` would return the key itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + '1')
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.get(key + '1')` would return the value associated with the key `key + '1'` in the `this._data` map, whereas `key` would return the key itself.
