Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `indexOf` returns the first occurrence, potentially leading to incorrect results if the escape symbol appears multiple times in the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value is found, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the specified value, requiring a comparison to -1 to determine if the value is not found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first match of the specified regular expression, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the specified string, potentially leading to incorrect results if the pattern contains special characters that are interpreted differently by regular expressions.

DONE.
