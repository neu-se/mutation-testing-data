  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().then()` is a stub that doesn't actually create a new deferred object, making it a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void _.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `_.defer()` is a function that returns undefined, meaning it doesn't do anything with the deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a deferred object, and the code would throw a syntax error.

DONE.
