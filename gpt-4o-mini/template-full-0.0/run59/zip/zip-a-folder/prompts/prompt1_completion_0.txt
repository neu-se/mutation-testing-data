Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the compression level is not high, which would lead to the wrong branch being executed when the compression level is actually set to high.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for the medium compression level, which would cause the code to execute the branch for uncompressed files only when the compression level is medium, ignoring other levels.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the source string is empty instead of checking the compression level, which would lead to the compress function being called based on the source path rather than the intended compression setting.

DONE.
