  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function expects a promise as an argument, but `exception.value` is a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(Q(exception.value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function expects a promise as an argument, but `Q(exception.value)` is a promise for a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration(Q.resolve(exception.value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function expects a promise as an argument, but `Q.resolve(exception.value)` is a promise that is already resolved with the value.

DONE.
