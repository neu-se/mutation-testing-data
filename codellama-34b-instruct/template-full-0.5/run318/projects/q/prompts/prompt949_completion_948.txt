  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object in JavaScript, and they have different behaviors when it comes to passing arguments to the function. `call` expects the context and arguments to be passed separately, while `apply` expects the context and arguments to be passed in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the first argument passed to `bind`, and its arguments set to the second argument passed to `bind`. This can cause the function to behave differently than it would if it were called directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the first argument passed to `bind
