  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + 'extra string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returned the content of the file, while this modified version returns the content plus an extra string. This change would break any code that relies on the original behavior of returning only the content of the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, options).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not modify the content of the file, while this modified version reads the file in upper case. This change would break any code that relies on the original behavior of reading the file in lower case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace('foo', 'bar')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not modify the content of the file, while this modified version replaces the string "foo" with "bar" in the content of the file. This change would break any code
