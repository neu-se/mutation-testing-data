  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"npost", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because "npost" is not a recognized method, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"wrongPost", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because "wrongPost" is not a recognized method, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post__", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because "post__" is not a recognized method, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
