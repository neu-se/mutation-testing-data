  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the `stack` property of the `error` object to a concatenation of the error's stack trace and the stack trace of the `promise` object, while the modified code fragment sets the `stack` property to the string "foo".
