  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are different variables representing the latitude of the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` and `λ2` are different variables representing the longitude of the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and using it in place of `φ2` would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

DONE.
