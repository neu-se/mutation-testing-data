  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is not the same as `a` and would change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because `b - a` is not the same as `a` and would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is not the same as `a` and would change the result of the function.

DONE.
