  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `definition` function immediately, whereas the original code fragment would pass the function itself as a parameter to the `define` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first parameter to the `define` function, whereas the original code fragment passes the `definition` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an anonymous function as the first parameter to the `define` function, whereas the original code fragment passes the `definition` function.

DONE.
