Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.join(currentPath, targetPath)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly concatenate the `currentPath` and `targetPath` instead of replacing `currentPath` with `targetPath` in the `file.name` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not replace `currentPath` with `targetPath` in the `file.name` string, resulting in an incorrect target path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (x) { return x; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not perform any replacement operation, instead returning the original string, which would lead to incorrect target paths.

DONE.
