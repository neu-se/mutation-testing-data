  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the "definition" function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to "requestTick".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty function as the argument to "requestTick", rather than the "definition" function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass "undefined" as the argument to "requestTick", rather than the "definition" function.

DONE.
