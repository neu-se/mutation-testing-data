  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `rejected` is a function, while this new code checks if it is not `undefined`. If `rejected` is a function, the behavior would be the same, but if it is not a function, the original code would call `rejected` with the exception, while this new code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `rejected` is a function, while this new code checks if it is not `undefined`. If `rejected` is a function, the behavior would be the same, but if it is not a function, the original code would call `rejected` with the exception, while this new code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected === "boolean"
```
This would result in different behavior because
