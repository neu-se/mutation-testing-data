  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `z['re']` is NaN, but the new code is checking if `z['re']` is not NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] && isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `z['re']` is NaN, but the new code is checking if `z['re']` is not NaN and also checking if it's truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `z['re']` is NaN, but the new code is checking if the result of `isNaN(z['re'])` is false.

DONE.
