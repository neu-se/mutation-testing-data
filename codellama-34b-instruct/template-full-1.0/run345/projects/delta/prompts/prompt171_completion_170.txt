  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string would be considered a valid insertion, while the code fragment `Math.min` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string would be considered a valid insertion, while the code fragment `Math.min` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Boolean(Math.random() > 0.5 ? Math.min : '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment `Math.random() ... > 0.5 ? Math.min : ''` would sometimes return the `Math.min` function and sometimes return an empty string, causing inconsistent results depending on the random outcome.

DONE.
