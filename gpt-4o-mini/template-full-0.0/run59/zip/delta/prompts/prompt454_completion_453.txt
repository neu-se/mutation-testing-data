Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `rest` method to return the entire slice of operations starting from the current index even when there is an offset, potentially leading to incorrect results when there are remaining operations that should not be included.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index === this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index is at the end of the operations array, which would incorrectly indicate that there are no more operations to return, even if there are remaining operations that should be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the `rest` method to return operations only if the index is not at the last operation, potentially omitting the last operation from the result when it should be included.

DONE.
