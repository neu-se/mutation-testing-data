  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns the type of a variable, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.type
```
This would result in different behavior because `word.type` would return the value of the `type` property of the `word` object, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `word.constructor.name` would return the name of the constructor function that created the `word` object, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

DONE.
