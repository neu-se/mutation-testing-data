  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has `i >= array.length`, which means the function will return `true` if `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, whereas the changed code will return `true` only if `i` is strictly greater than the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has `i++`, which increments the value of `i` by one, whereas the changed code will decrement the value of `i` by one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has `cb(null, array[i++])`, which will return the value of `array[i]` and then increment `i`, whereas the changed code will return the value of `array[i]` without
