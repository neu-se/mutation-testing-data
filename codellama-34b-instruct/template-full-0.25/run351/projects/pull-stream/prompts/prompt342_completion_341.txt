  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, so if `cb` is truthy, it will become falsy, and if `cb` is falsy, it will become truthy. This could cause the `onAbort` callback to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `cb`, which could cause the `onAbort` callback to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `cb` by 2, which could cause the `onAbort` callback to be called with a different value than expected.

DONE.
