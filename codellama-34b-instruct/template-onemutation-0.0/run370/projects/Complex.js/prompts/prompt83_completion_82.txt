  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if they are not equal to 0. This change would cause the code to behave differently in certain cases, potentially leading to errors or unexpected results.

DONE.
