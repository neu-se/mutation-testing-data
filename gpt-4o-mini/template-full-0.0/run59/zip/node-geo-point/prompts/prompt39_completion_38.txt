Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the difference in longitudes instead of the correct calculation involving the cosine of the difference in longitudes, which would lead to an incorrect distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine of the latitude of point1 instead of the correct cosine calculation, which would yield an incorrect result for the distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the cosine calculation with a constant value of 1, which would lead to an incorrect distance calculation as it disregards the actual geographical relationship between the two points.

DONE.
