  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, `pop` would remove the reason for the unhandled rejection, which would likely cause the rejection to be handled differently.
