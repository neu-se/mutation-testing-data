  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src, /./g)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character in the glob pattern, rather than just the characters in the source.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `isGlob` function, so if the source was a glob, it would return `false`, and if the source was not a glob, it would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src, { git: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enable the `git` option in the `isGlob` function, which would allow it to match files that are tracked by Git, as well as those that are not.

DONE.
