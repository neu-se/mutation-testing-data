  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read && _read.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `_read` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `_read` is both truthy and has a non-zero length. If `_read` is a non-empty array, the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read && _read.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `_read` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `_read` is both truthy and has a length greater than 0. If `_read` is a non-empty array, the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read && _read.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior
