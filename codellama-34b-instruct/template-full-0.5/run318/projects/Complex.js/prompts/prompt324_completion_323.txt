  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is used in the `cosh` function, which would produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is used in the `sinh` function, which would produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` and `b` variables are used in the `cosh` and `sinh` functions, which would produce a different output.

DONE.
