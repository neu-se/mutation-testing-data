  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a rejected promise, whereas `Q` creates a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` creates a new deferred object, whereas `Q` creates a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` creates a new asynchronous operation, whereas `Q` creates a resolved promise.

DONE.
