  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if both `z` and `a` are infinite, regardless of whether they are equal or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if either `z` or `a` is infinite, regardless of whether they are equal or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if both `z` and `a` are infinite, regardless of whether they are equal or not.

DONE.
