 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original expression would always evaluate to `NaN` when `b` is 0, while the mutated expression would throw a division-by-zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original expression uses the sign of `b` to determine the sign of the result, while the mutated expression would always make the result positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original expression does not modify `b`, while the mutated expression would add 1 to `b` before using it.

DONE.
