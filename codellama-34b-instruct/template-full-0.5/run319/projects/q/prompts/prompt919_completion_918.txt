  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with the wrong `this` value, which would cause it to fail to resolve the promise correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with the wrong `this` value, which would cause it to fail to resolve the promise correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with the wrong `this` value, which would cause it to fail to resolve the promise correctly.

DONE.
