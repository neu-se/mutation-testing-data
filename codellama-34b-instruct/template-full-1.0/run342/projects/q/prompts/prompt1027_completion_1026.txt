  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(nodeback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!(nodeback)` will always be truthy, even if `nodeback` is not a function, which would result in the `else` block being executed and the promise being returned, rather than the `if` block being executed, which would result in the `nodeback` being called with the result of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nodeback === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof nodeback === "function"` will check if `nodeback` is a function, while the original code fragment only checks if `nodeback` is truthy. If `nodeback` is not a function but is also not falsy, the `else` block will be executed and the promise will be returned, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback
