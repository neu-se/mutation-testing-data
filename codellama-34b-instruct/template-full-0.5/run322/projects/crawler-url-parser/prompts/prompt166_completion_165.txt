  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a difference of exactly -1, whereas this new code checks for a difference greater than 1. If the linkurl has more than two more parts than the pageurl, this new code would return "uplevel", whereas the original code would return "internal".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a difference of exactly -1, whereas this new code checks for any non-zero difference. If the linkurl has any more or fewer parts than the pageurl, this new code would return "uplevel", whereas the original code would return "internal".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.length > pageurl_parts.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a difference of exactly -1, whereas this new
