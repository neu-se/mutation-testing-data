 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of the match array instead of the number of properties in the regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count >= this.regex.props.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the count is greater than or equal to the number of properties in the regex, instead of just greater than.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(ctx).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there are any keys in the context object, instead of checking if the current path has a matching property in the context object.

DONE.
