  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This change will cause the `diff()` function to consider `insert` operations as `delete` operations, which will result in incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This change will cause the `diff()` function to consider `retain` operations as `delete` operations, which will result in incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' && otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This change will cause the `diff()` function to consider `delete` operations as `insert` operations, which will result in incorrect behavior.

DONE.
