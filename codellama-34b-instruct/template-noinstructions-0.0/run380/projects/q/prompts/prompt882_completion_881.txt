  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the promise returned by `fapply`, which would cause the promise to be rejected if the `fapply` method fails. In the original code, the `fail` method is called on the promise returned by `nfapply`, which would cause the promise to be rejected if the `nfapply` method fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the promise returned by `fapply`, which would cause the promise to be resolved if the `fapply` method fails. In the original code, the `fail` method is called on the promise returned by `nfapply`, which would cause the promise to be rejected if the `nfapply` method fails.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
