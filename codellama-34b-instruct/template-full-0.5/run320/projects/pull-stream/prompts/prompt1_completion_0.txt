  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for-in` loop would not iterate over the properties of the `sources` object, as `null` is not a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 'some string';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for-in` loop would iterate over the properties of the `sources` object, but the loop condition would always be false, as the `k` variable is a string and not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for-in` loop would iterate over the properties of the `sources` object, but the loop condition would always be true, as the `k` variable is a number and not a string.

DONE.
