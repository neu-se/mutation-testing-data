  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` argument is now multiplied by 2, which would cause the stringified JSON to have twice as many spaces as the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` argument is now incremented by 1, which would cause the stringified JSON to have one more space than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` argument is now decremented by 1, which would cause the stringified JSON to have one fewer space than the original.

DONE.
