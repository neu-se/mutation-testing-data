  Sure, here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the provided code with different code fragments that would result in different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in the promise being rejected instead of resolved, which would cause any subsequent `then` or `catch` callbacks to be invoked with the rejection reason as their first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in the promise being resolved instead of rejected, which would cause any subsequent `then` or `catch` callbacks to be invoked with the resolved value as their first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in the promise being notified instead of resolved or rejected, which would cause any subsequent `progress` callbacks to be invoked with the notification value as their first argument.

DONE.
