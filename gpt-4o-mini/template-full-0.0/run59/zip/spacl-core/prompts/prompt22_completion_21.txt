Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.replace]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called from `Symbol.match`, which is intended for matching, to `Symbol.replace`, which is used for replacing substrings, thus altering the functionality of the matcher.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the input string by converting it to uppercase before matching, which could lead to mismatches if the original string contains lowercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string + 'extra')
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'extra' to the input string before matching, which would likely cause the match to fail for any valid input that does not end with 'extra'.

DONE.
