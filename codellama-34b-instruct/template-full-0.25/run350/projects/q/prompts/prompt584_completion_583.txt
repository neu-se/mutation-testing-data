  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result.value` property is not defined, and the `Q` function would return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value).then(function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would return a promise that is resolved with the value of `result.value`, but the `then` method would return a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value).then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would return a promise that is resolved with the value of `result.value`, but the `then` method would return a new promise that is resolved with the
