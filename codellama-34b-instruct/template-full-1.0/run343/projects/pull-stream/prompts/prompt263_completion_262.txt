  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a value in the `data` parameter, but replacing it with `null` would cause the code to always return `null`, regardless of whether there was actually a value present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a value in the `data` parameter, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the code to always return `undefined`, regardless of whether there was actually a value present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"something else"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of a value in the `data` parameter, but replacing it with a different string would cause the code to always return the new string, regardless of whether there was actually a value present.

DONE.
