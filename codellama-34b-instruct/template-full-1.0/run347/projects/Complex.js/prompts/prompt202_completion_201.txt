  Sure, here are three possible buggy code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the `pow` method of the `Complex` class:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.pow(Math.pow(a, z['re']), z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `x` variable, which is not defined in the scope of the `pow` method. This change would result in a `ReferenceError` when the `pow` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * Math.pow(a, z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `x` variable to compute the square root of the complex number, while this change uses the `z['re']` variable. This would result in a different value for the square root, which could affect the accuracy of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
