  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` expects a string representing a URL, while `URL.resolve` expects a URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.format` expects a URL object, while `URL.resolve` expects a string representing a URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolveObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolveObject` expects a URL object and a base URL object, while `URL.resolve` expects a URL object and a base URL string.

DONE.
