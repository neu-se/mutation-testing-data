  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the retain property instead of the delete property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the presence of the delete property instead of its type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the delete property being an object instead of a number.

DONE.
