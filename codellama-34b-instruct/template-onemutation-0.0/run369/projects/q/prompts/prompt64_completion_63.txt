  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a specified number of milliseconds, while `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed asynchronously as soon as possible.

DONE.
