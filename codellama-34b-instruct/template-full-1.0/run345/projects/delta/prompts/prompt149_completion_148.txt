  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with buggy code fragments that have different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (<PLACEHOLDER>) {
  otherIter.next(firstOther.retain + firstLeft);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `firstLeft` variable is not properly subtracted from `firstOther.retain`, which could cause the algorithm to skip over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (<PLACEHOLDER>) {
  otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft);
} else {
  otherIter.next(firstOther.retain);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `else` block is not properly accounting for the possibility that `firstLeft` is greater than `firstOther.retain`, which could cause the algorithm to skip over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
