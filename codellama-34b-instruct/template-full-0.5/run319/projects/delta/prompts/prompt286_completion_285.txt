  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline + start
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(newline + start), 0`, which would result in a different value for `start`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - newline
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `start - (newline, 0)`, which would result in a different value for `start`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * newline
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `start * (newline, 0)`, which would result in a different value for `start`.

DONE.
