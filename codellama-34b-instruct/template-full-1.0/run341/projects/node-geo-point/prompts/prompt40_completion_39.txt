  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1Rad * point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the dot product of the two radian values instead of taking the ratio of the two values. The dot product would always be positive, resulting in an acos value between 0 and 1, whereas the correct calculation should give an acos value between -1 and 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2Rad / point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the ratio of the two radian values instead of taking the dot product. The ratio would always be positive, resulting in an acos value between 0 and 1, whereas the correct calculation should give an acos value between -1 and 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1Rad + point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the two radian values instead of taking the ratio or dot product. The sum would
