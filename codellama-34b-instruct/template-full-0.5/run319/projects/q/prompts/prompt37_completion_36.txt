  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the `domain` variable, so the code would enter the `if` block if `domain` is falsy, and the `else` block if `domain` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would attempt to concatenate the `domain` variable with the number `1`, which would result in a `TypeError` if `domain` is not a string or a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.` operator would attempt to access the `foo` property of the `domain` object, which would result in a `ReferenceError` if `domain` is not an object or if it does not have a `foo` property.

DONE.
