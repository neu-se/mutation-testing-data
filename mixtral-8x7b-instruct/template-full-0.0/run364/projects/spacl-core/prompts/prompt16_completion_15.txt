 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/^.+[^/]$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches strings that don't end with a slash but have at least one character before the end, unlike the original regex which matches strings ending with a slash and at least one character before it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/^.+[^/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches strings that end with one or more characters that are not a slash, while the original regex matches strings ending with a slash and at least one character before it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/^.+[^/]{2,}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches strings that end with two or more characters that are not a slash, while the original regex matches strings ending with a slash and at least one character before it.

DONE.
