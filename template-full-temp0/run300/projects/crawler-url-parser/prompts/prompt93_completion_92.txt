  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { normalizeHttps: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `normalizeHttps` option would cause the URL to be normalized to use the `https` protocol, which could change the URL's host and port.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { normalizeProtocol: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `normalizeProtocol` option would cause the URL to be normalized to use the `http` protocol, which could change the URL's host and port.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { removeQueryParameters: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `removeQueryParameters` option would cause the URL's query parameters to be preserved, which could change the URL's path and query string.

DONE.
