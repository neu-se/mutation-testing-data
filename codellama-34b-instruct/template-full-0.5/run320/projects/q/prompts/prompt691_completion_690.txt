  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the `this` context within the `dispatch` method, which could potentially cause the method to behave differently or error out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the number of arguments passed to the `dispatch` method, which could potentially cause the method to behave differently or error out.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the number of arguments passed to the `dispatch` method, which could potentially cause the method to behave differently or error out.

DONE.
