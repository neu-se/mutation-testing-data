  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (index < end && iter.hasNext()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra condition `index < end` would cause the loop to exit early, potentially leaving some operations unaccounted for.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (iter.hasNext()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would continue to iterate even after `index` exceeds `end`, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (index < end) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would exit early, without processing all remaining operations.

DONE.
