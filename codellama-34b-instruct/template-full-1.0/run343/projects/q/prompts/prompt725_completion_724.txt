  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (fulfilledValue) {
  return {
    state: "fulfilled",
    value: fulfilledValue
  };
}, function (rejectedValue) {
  return {
    state: "rejected",
    value: rejectedValue
  };
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer return a promise, but an object with a `state` property and a `value` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (fulfilledValue) {
  return "fulfilled";
}, function (rejectedValue) {
  return "rejected";
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the strings "fulfilled" or "rejected" instead of the objects with the same properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (fulfilledValue) {
  return rejected
