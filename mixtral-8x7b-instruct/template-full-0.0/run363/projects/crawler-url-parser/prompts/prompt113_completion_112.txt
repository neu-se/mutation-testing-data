 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...urlMap.values()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an array from the values, which may not behave the same as the original iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.from(urlMap.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of keys instead of values, which may not be the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.values(urlMap)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of values using Object.values, which may not behave the same as the original iterator.

DONE.
