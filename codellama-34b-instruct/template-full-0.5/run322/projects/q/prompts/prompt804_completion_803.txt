  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progressed function to be called with null as its first argument, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progressed function to be called with undefined as its first argument, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed, null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progressed function to be called with null as its second and third arguments, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
