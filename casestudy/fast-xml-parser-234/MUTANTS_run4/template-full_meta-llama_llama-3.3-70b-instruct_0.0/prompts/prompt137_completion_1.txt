Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[a-zA-Z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any trailing letters from the string instead of removing trailing zeros after a decimal point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\d+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any trailing digits from the string, not just zeros after a decimal point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^0-9.]$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any non-numeric characters (except decimal points) from the end of the string, instead of removing trailing zeros after a decimal point.

DONE.
