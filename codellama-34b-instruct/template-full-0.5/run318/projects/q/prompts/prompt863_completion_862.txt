  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be set to 0 milliseconds, causing the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be set to null, causing the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be set to undefined, causing the promise to be rejected immediately.

DONE.
