 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the second argument in the multiplication, which can lead to different results in the square root calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + a))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.sqrt` function, which can lead to different results due to the way it handles negative inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * Math.abs(r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.abs` function, which can lead to different results due to the way it handles negative inputs.

DONE.
