  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(1)
```
This will cause the `stripBom` function to receive a slice of the `data` array starting from the second element, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This will cause the `stripBom` function to receive the length of the `data` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.pop()
```
This will cause the `stripBom` function to receive the last element of the `data` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
