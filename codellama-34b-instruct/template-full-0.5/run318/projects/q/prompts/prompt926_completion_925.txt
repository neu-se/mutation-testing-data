  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a function that is called with the given arguments, while `deferred.promise` is a promise that resolves to the given arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a function that is called with the given arguments, while `Q.resolve(callback)` is a promise that resolves to the result of calling `callback` with the given arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a function that is called with the given arguments, while `Q.reject(callback)` is a promise that rejects with the result of calling `callback` with the given arguments.

DONE.
