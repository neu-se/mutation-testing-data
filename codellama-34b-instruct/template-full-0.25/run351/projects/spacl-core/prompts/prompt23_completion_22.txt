  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method returns a new string starting from the specified index, whereas the original code fragment returns the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method returns a new string with all characters in uppercase, whereas the original code fragment returns the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods are used to reverse the order of the characters in the string, whereas the original code fragment returns the original string.

DONE.
