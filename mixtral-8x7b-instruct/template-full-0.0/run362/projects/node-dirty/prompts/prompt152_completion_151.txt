 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the `_writeStream.uncork()` call from being reached, causing the stream to stop writing data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_flush` function to always return, preventing any further writes to the write stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete this._waitForDrain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the `_waitForDrain` property from the current object, causing the `this._waitForDrain` check in the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
