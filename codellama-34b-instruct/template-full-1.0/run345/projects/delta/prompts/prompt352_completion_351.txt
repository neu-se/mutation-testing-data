  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes - op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` method to always retain the same number of characters, instead of retaining a different number of characters depending on the `attributes` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes + op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` method to always retain a different number of characters, depending on the `attributes` parameter and the `baseOp.attributes` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes ? baseOp.attributes : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` method to always retain zero characters if the `attributes` parameter is falsy, instead of retaining a number of characters equal to the `attributes` parameter.

DONE.
