  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if `linkurl` is an instance of the `String` class, while `typeof` checks if `linkurl` is a string primitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` checks if `linkurl` has a length greater than 0, while `typeof` checks if `linkurl` is a string primitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.startsWith("https")
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if `linkurl` starts with the string "https", while `typeof` checks if `linkurl` is a string primitive.

DONE.
