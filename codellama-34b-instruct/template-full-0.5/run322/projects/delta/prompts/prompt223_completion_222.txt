  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the delta's string representation to itself, which would always return true, causing the diff function to return an empty delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the delta's string representation to a third string that is not related to the delta, which would always return false, causing the diff function to return the entire delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the delta's string representation to null, which would always return false, causing the diff function to return the entire delta.

DONE.
