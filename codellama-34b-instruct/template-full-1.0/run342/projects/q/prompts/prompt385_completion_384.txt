  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Q.Promise(() => { throw new Error('test'); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new promise that throws an error, causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.Promise.resolve(value * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with the value multiplied by 2, which would affect the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.Promise.reject(new Error('test'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with an error, causing the test to fail.

DONE.
