  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the object is now an empty object, which can be used in different ways than the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve({})
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.resolve() returns a promise that resolves with the given value, but the original code does not use promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Object()
```
This would result in different behavior because new Object() is a different way of constructing a new object, which can be used in different ways than the original object.

DONE.
