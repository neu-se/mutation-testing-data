  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is being called with the `reverse` method, which would reverse the order of the elements in the array, rather than slicing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is being called with the `sort` method, which would sort the elements in the array, rather than slicing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is being called with the `map` method, which would multiply each element in the array by 2, rather than slicing it.

DONE.
