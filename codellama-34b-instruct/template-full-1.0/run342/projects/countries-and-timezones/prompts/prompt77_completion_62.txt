  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array(memoizedTimezones).fill(timezones);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an array of length `memoizedTimezones` filled with the `timezones` object, rather than returning the length of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(memoizedTimezones * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `memoizedTimezones` value by 2, rather than returning the length of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(memoizedTimezones / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rounded up value of the `memoizedTimezones` value divided by 2, rather than returning the length of the object.

DONE.
