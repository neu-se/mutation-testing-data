  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(next.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the `next.promise` immediately, rather than waiting for the `next` deferred to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(Q.resolve(next.promise));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the `next.promise` using the `Q.resolve` method, which would return a new promise that is resolved with the value of `next.promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(Q.reject(next.promise));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the `next.promise` using the `Q.reject` method, which would return a new promise that is rejected with the value of `next.promise`.

DONE.
