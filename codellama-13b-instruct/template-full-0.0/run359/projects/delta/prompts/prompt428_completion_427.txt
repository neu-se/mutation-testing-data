  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object and not null, while the new code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object and not null, but also checks if `op.retain` is a string. This would cause the function to return a different value for certain inputs, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null && typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object and not null, while the new code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object and not null, but also checks if `op.retain` is a string.
