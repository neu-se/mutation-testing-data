 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is being passed instead of `void 0`, which could cause issues if the `then` method expects a specific type for the progressed callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this, this, progressed
