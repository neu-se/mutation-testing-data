  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next` is a function that advances the iterator to the next element, while `thisIter.next()` is a function call that returns the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` is a function that advances the iterator to the next element, while `otherIter.next()` is a function call that returns the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
