  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

NULL_CHARACTER
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` and `b` are not objects, and throw an error if they are. This would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return `undefined` for the embed type and data, which would then cause the `Delta` class to throw an error when trying to access the `Embed` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` and `b` are not strings, and throw an error if they are. This would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return `undefined` for the embed type and data, which would then cause the `Delta` class to throw an error when trying to access the `Embed` class.

```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` and `b
