  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1 instead of 0 when places is falsy, which would cause the function to always round up to the nearest integer instead of rounding down.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return -1 instead of 0 when places is falsy, which would cause the function to always round down to the nearest integer instead of rounding up.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a random number instead of 0 when places is falsy, which would cause the function to round to a random number instead of rounding to the nearest integer.

DONE.
