  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, ~1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `~` operator, when used with a number as its operand, negates each bit of the number. In this case, the result would be `-2`. This would cause the `splice()` method to remove the wrong element from the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to incorrect handling of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, !at
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `at` variable, so the `splice()` method would remove the element at the opposite index from the one that was intended. This would likely cause unhandled rejections to be left unhandled, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, -at
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator negates the `at` variable, so the `splice()` method would remove the
