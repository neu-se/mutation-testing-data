  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `process.domain` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `process.domain` is falsy, while this replacement checks if it is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.domain === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `process.domain` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is undefined.

DONE.
