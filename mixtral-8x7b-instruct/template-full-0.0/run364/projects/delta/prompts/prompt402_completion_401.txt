 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(thisData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the embedType with the first key of the `thisData` object instead of the `otherData` object. This change would cause the transformation to behave differently when both `thisData` and `otherData` are objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === 'embedType'
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the embedType with a string 'embedType' instead of comparing it with the keys of the `otherData` object. This change would cause the transformation to fail when both `thisData` and `otherData` are objects with an 'embedType' property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the embedType is not null instead of checking if the embedType is equal to the first key of the `otherData
