  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.protocol = 'https';
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol of the base URL would be changed to "https", which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.host = 'example.com';
```
This would result in different behavior because the host of the base URL would be changed to "example.com", which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.pathname = '/path/to/resource';
```
This would result in different behavior because the pathname of the base URL would be changed to "/path/to/resource", which could affect the parsing of the URL.

DONE.
