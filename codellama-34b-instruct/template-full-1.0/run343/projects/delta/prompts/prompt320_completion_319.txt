  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator would cause the line `const retDelta = new Delta();` to be executed, which is not the intention of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operator would cause the line `retDelta.push(otherIter.next());` to be executed, which is not the intention of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` operator would cause the line `retDelta.push(otherIter.next());` to be executed, which is not the intention of the original code.

DONE.
