  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise["inspect"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` is being replaced with `promise["inspect"]`, which is a property accessor that will only work if `inspect` is a valid property on the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` is being replaced with `promise.inspect()`, which is a function call that will only work if `inspect` is a function on the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect?.()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect?.()` is using the optional chaining operator (`?.`) which will only call the `inspect` method on the `promise` object if `inspect` is a valid property on the object and is a function.
