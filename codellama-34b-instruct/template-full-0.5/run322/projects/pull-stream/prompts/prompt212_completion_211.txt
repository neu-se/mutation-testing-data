  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` is a reference to a function, while `abortCb()` is a function call, which would cause the function to be executed immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb.call()` is a function call with an explicit `this` context, which would cause the function to be executed in a different context than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb.apply()` is a function call with an explicit `this` context and an arguments array, which would cause the function to be executed with a different set of arguments than the original code fragment.

DONE.
