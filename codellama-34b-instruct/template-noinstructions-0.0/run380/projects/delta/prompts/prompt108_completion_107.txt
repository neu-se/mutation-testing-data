  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => boolean
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would always return `true`, causing the `filter` method to return all elements in the array, regardless of whether they match the predicate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => void
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would always return `undefined`, causing the `filter` method to return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would return `true` for every even-indexed element in the array, causing the `filter` method to return only the even-indexed elements.

DONE.
