  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the sign of the angle, causing the distance calculation to point in the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the angle, causing the distance calculation to point twice as far away.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the angle of the second point instead of the first point, causing the distance calculation to point in a different direction.

DONE.
