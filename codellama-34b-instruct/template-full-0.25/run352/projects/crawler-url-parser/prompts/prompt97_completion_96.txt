  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `currentUrl` is truthy, even if `currentUrl.url` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.url.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `true` if `currentUrl.url` is a non-empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.url.match(/^https?:\/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `true` if `currentUrl.url` starts with `http://` or `https://`.

DONE.
