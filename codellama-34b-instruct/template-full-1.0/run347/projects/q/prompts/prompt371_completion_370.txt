  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with 
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the value is null, the progressed function will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with 
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if the value is undefined, the progressed function will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with 
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the progressed function would be called with a different value, effectively changing the behavior of the progress propagator.

DONE.
