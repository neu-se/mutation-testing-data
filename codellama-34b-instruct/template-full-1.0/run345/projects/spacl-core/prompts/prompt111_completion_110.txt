  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.keys()` returns an iterable over the keys in `this.verbs`, while `verbs` is an object that can be iterated over directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.values()` returns an iterable over the values in `this.verbs`, while `verbs` is an object that can be iterated over directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.entries()` returns an iterable over the key-value pairs in `this.verbs`, while `verbs` is an object that can be iterated over directly.

DONE.
