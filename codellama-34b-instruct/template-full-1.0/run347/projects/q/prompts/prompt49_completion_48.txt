  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was calling `domain.exit()` with no arguments, while this variant is calling it with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was calling `domain.exit()` with no arguments, while this variant is calling it with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was calling `domain.exit()` with no arguments, while this variant is calling it with `0`.

DONE.
