  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be passed as the `this` value to the `callback` function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `arguments` object would be passed as the `this` value to the `callback` function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `arguments` object would be passed as the `this` value to the `callback` function, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
