  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` argument is not being passed to the `reject` function, which could cause the promise to be rejected with an incorrect reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a valid reason for rejection, and could cause the promise to be rejected with an incorrect reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a valid reason for rejection, and could cause the promise to be rejected with an incorrect reason.

DONE.
