  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test(data)` is not the same as `test(data)`. The former calls the `test` method on the `tester` object, while the latter calls the `test` function with `data` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test(data, true)` would pass an additional argument to the `test` function, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!test(data)` would negate the result of the `test` function, which may cause the `if` statement to behave differently.

DONE.
