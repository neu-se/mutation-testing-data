  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include a negative lookahead assertion, which would cause the replacement to be skipped if the string starts with a protocol (e.g. "http://").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to replace the protocol with an empty string, which would cause the URL to be parsed without a protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to replace the protocol with "ftp://", which would cause the URL to be parsed as an FTP
