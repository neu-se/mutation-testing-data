  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator would be a space instead of a newline, which could cause the stack trace to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator would be a tab instead of a newline, which could cause the stack trace to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\r\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator would be a carriage return and newline instead of just a newline, which could cause the stack trace to be parsed incorrectly.

DONE.
