  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in the `drain` event being emitted immediately, rather than waiting for the `writeStream` to drain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('close')
```
This would result in the `close` event being emitted immediately, rather than waiting for the `writeStream` to close.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(() => this.emit('drain'))
```
This would result in the `drain` event being emitted after the current event loop iteration, rather than waiting for the `writeStream` to drain.

DONE.
