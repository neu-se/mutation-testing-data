  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function expects a single argument, but `2*b` would provide two arguments, leading to a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function expects a complex number as its argument, but `a` is a real number, leading to a type mismatch error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function expects a complex number as its argument, but `b-a` is a real number, leading to a type mismatch error.

DONE.
