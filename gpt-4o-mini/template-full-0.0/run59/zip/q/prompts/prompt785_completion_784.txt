Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Promise rejected");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the rejection reason to the next promise in the chain, it logs a message to the console, effectively swallowing the rejection and preventing any error handling from occurring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a new error instead of passing the original rejection reason, which could lead to loss of context about the original error and potentially disrupt the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "Rejection handled";
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a string instead of the rejection reason, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a string value rather than being rejected, thus altering the expected flow of error handling in the promise chain.

DONE.
