  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, whereas `args` is a reference to the original array. This could cause unexpected behavior if the function being called with `apply` modifies the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, [].concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].concat(args)` creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `args` array and an empty array. This could cause unexpected behavior if the function being called with `apply` expects a specific number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.map(function(arg) { return arg; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map(function(arg) { return arg; })` creates a new array that is a copy of the `args` array, but with each element
