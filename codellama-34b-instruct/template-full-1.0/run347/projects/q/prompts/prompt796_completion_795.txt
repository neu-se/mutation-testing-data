  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with different code fragments that would result in different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (progressed) {
    throw new Error("Progress not allowed");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent progress updates from being sent to the callback function provided to the `progress` method, which would allow the user to handle progress updates in a different way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed += 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the progress counter always increase by one, rather than decreasing by one as is intended by the original code. This would cause the progress counter to become stuck at a certain value, rather than decreasing as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed *= 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the progress counter double its value each time it is incremented, rather than increasing by
