  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(null, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.apply(null, ref)` would call the `pull` function with the `ref` array as the argument list, whereas the original code fragment `pull(read, ref[0], ref[1])` calls the `pull` function with the `read` variable as the first argument and the elements of the `ref` array as the subsequent arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(null, [read].concat(ref))
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.apply(null, [read].concat(ref))` would call the `pull` function with the `read` variable as the first argument and the elements of the `ref` array as the subsequent arguments, whereas the original code fragment `pull(read, ref[0], ref[1])` calls the `pull` function with the `read` variable as the first argument and the elements of the `ref` array as the subsequent arguments.
