  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) {
  return data.timezones[id] || {};
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object directly without using the `reduce()` method to iterate over the object properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) {
  return data.timezones.filter((tz) => tz.c === id);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezone objects that have a country code that matches the given `id`, instead of returning a map of countries to timezone objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) {
  return data.timezones.find((tz) => tz.c === id);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first timezone object that has a country code that matches the given `id`, instead of returning a map of countries to timezone objects.
