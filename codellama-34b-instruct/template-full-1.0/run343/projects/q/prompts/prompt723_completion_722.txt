  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` is a different method than `isPromise` and would check if the promise is rejected instead of pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isSettled` is a different method than `isPromise` and would check if the promise is settled (i.e., either resolved or rejected) instead of pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending` is a different method than `isPromise` and would check if the promise is pending (i.e., neither resolved nor rejected) instead of checking if it's a promise.

DONE.
