  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This change will cause the `fromObject` method to use the `longitude` property instead of the `latitude` property, which may cause the method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' + 'longitude'
```
This change will cause the `fromObject` method to use the concatenation of the `latitude` and `longitude` properties instead of the `latitude` property, which may cause the method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' * 'longitude'
```
This change will cause the `fromObject` method to use the product of the `latitude` and `longitude` properties instead of the `latitude` property, which may cause the method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
