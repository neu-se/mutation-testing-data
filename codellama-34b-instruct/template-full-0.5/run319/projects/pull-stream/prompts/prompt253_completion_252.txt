  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that returns a stream, while `nextChunk` is a function that returns a chunk of data. If `nextStream` is used instead of `nextChunk`, the code would return a stream instead of a chunk of data, which could cause issues with the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextChunk()` is a function that returns a chunk of data, while `nextStream` is a function that returns a stream. If `nextChunk()` is used instead of `nextStream`, the code would return a chunk of data instead of a stream, which could cause issues with the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a value that is not a function, while `nextChunk` and `nextStream
