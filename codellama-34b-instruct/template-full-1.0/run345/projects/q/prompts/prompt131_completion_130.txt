  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function_call.bind(uncurryThis);
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` would be bound to `function_call`, which is a different function than the original `Function.call` function. This could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses `uncurryThis`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function.bind(Function.call);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.bind` and `Function.call` are different functions than `uncurryThis`. This could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses `uncurryThis`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.bind(Object.prototype);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a different function than the original `Function.call` function, and `Object.prototype` is a different object than the original `uncurryThis` function. This could cause unexpected behavior
