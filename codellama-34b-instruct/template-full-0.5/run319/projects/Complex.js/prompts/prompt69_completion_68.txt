  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return an object with properties 're' and 'im', while the new code would return a single value, the constant `Complex['INFINITY']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { 're': 0, 'im': 0 };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return an object with properties 're' and 'im', while the new code would return an object with properties 're' and 'im' that are both equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return an object with properties 're' and 'im', while the new code would return null.

DONE.
