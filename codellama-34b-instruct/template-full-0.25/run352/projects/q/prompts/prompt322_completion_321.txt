  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument to the `descriptor[op]` method, whereas the original code fragment passes all arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all arguments except the first one to the `descriptor[op]` method, whereas the original code fragment passes all arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(["extra argument"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all arguments plus an additional argument to the `descriptor[op]` method, whereas the original code fragment passes only the arguments that were passed to the `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
