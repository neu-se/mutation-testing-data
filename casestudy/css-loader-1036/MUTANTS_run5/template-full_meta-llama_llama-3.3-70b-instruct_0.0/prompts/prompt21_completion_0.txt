Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.filter.call(cssMapping.sources, (source) => true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `filter` method instead of `map`, and always returns `true` for each source, potentially altering the resulting array of source URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cssMapping.sources.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `forEach` method, which doesn't return a new array, instead of `map`, which returns a new array with the results of applying the provided function to each element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(cssMapping)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names, instead of an array of source URLs, potentially causing the `sourceURLs` variable to have a different structure and content.

DONE.
