  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the `value` to be used as the property key, and the `key` to be used as the property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method being called is changed from `set` to `get`, which would return the value of the property rather than setting a new value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method being called is changed from `set` to `delete`, which would remove the property from the object rather than setting a new value.

DONE.
