Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly references a non-existent capture group, which would lead to an invalid regex pattern and potentially cause runtime errors or unexpected matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the entire match instead of the first capture group, which would change the intended substitution behavior in the regex, leading to incorrect path matching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$1$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it duplicates the first capture group in the substitution, which could lead to incorrect path formatting and unintended matches in the resulting regex.

DONE.
