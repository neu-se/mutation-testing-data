Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the condition, causing the loop to execute when there are no more operations left to iterate over, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek() != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the next operation is not null instead of checking if there are more operations to iterate over, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the loop condition to require both iterators to have next elements, which could prevent the loop from executing if one of the iterators is exhausted, leading to incomplete processing of operations.

DONE.
