  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.slice` would return a new array containing the elements of the buffer array, while `buffer.split '\n'` would attempt to split the buffer string into an array based on the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++this. _inFlightWrites
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `_inFlightWrites` variable without checking if it is already equal to 0, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`${JSON.stringify({key: row.key, val: this. _data.get(row.key)})}\n`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not escape the `'` character in the JSON string, which could cause syntax errors in the program.

DONE.
