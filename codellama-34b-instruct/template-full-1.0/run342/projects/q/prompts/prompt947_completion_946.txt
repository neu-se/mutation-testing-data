  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeReject` is a function that rejects the promise with an error, while `makeNodeResolver` is a function that resolves the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeCallback` is a function that takes a callback function and some arguments, and returns a promise that is resolved with the result of the callback function, not the result of the node resolver function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, not with a node resolver function.

DONE.
