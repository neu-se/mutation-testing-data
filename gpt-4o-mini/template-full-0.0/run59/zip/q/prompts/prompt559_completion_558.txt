Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception instanceof Error
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the exception is an instance of the `Error` class, which would incorrectly handle exceptions that are not `StopIteration`, leading to potential unhandled exceptions in the generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the exception is `null`, which would always return `false` for any thrown exception, causing the generator to reject all exceptions instead of handling `StopIteration` correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exception === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the exception is a string, which would not correctly identify `StopIteration` exceptions, leading to incorrect rejection handling for generator functions that throw non-string exceptions.

DONE.
