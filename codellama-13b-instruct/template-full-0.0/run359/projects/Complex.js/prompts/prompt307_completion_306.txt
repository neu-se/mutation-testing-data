  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is used instead of the `cos` function, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is used instead of the `sin` function, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function is used instead of the `tan` function, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
