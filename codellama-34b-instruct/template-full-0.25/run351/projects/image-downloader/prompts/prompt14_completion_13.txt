  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `decodeURIComponent` to decode the basename, but this replacement code fragment uses `toLowerCase` to convert the decoded basename to lowercase. This could cause the test to pass even if the `decodeURIComponent` function is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `path.basename` to get the basename of the URL, but this replacement code fragment uses `split` to get the first part of the basename before the dot. This could cause the test to pass even if the `path.basename` function is not working correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.pathname.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `path.basename`
