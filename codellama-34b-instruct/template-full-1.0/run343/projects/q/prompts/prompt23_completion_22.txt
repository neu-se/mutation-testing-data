  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 domain.login
```
This would result in different behavior because `login` is a different method on the `domain` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `enter` method on the first element of the `domain` object, which is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `enter` method on the `domain` object with the argument `42`.

DONE.
