 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection is now a resolution, which means the error is not properly handled and can cause unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (rejection) { deferred.resolve(rejection); }
