  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.reviver` method is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, { reviver: options.reviver })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` method is being called with a different object than the original `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver ? options.reviver : null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` method is not being called if it is not specified in the `options` object.

DONE.
