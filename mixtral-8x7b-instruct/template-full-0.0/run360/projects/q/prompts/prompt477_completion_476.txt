 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the rejection at the first index, instead of the one at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the rejection at the specified index and remove the next one instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the first rejection in the array, regardless of the specified index.

DONE.
