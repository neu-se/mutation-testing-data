  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of substrings, while the `pop` method returns the last element of an array. In this case, the `pop` method would return the last part of the URL path, which may not be the same as the `pageurl_path` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/[^\/]+$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method returns a new string with the specified pattern replaced, while the `pageurl_path` variable is a string. In this case, the `replace` method would remove the last part of the URL path, which may not be the same as the `pageurl_path` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.substr(0, pageurl_path.lastIndexOf("/"))
```
