  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, regardless of the value of `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, with `index` equal to `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index == length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute if `index` is equal to `length`, and would skip the last iteration otherwise.

DONE.
