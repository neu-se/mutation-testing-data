  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is used in the `Math.abs()` function, which would return a different value if `b` is incremented by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is used in the `Math.abs()` function, which would return a different value if `b` is decremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is used in the `Math.abs()` function, which would return a different value if `b` is multiplied by 2.

DONE.
