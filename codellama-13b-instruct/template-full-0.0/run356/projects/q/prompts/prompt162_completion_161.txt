  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of lines, whereas the original code fragment would split the stack trace into an array of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of words, whereas the original code fragment would split the stack trace into an array of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of individual characters, whereas the original code fragment would split the stack trace into an array of characters.

DONE.
