  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/o/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the "o" to "e" in the input word, whereas the original code fragment only changed the "a" to "e".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an "s" to the input word, whereas the original code fragment replaced the "a" with "e".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/[aeiouy]$/, '') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last vowel in the input word, whereas the original code fragment only changed the "a" to "e".

DONE.
