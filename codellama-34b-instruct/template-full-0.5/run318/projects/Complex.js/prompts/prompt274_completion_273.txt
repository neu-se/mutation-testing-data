  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'], this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which could cause errors in calculations that depend on the correct orientation of the number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im'], this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the imaginary part of the complex number, which could cause errors in calculations that depend on the sign of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1, this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, which could cause errors in calculations that depend on the exact value of the imaginary part.

DONE.
