  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function, which returns the cosine of the argument, while this replacement uses the `sin` function, which returns the sine of the argument. This would cause the resulting bearing to be different from the original bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function, which returns the cosine of the argument, while this replacement uses the `cos` function again, which would cause the resulting bearing to be the same as the original bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function, which returns the cosine of the argument, while this replacement uses the `sin` function
