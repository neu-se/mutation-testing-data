  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse2
```
This would result in different behavior because `parse2` is a different function that has a different implementation, and it may return a different value than `parse`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl, pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parse` is being called with a different set of arguments, which may result in a different parsed URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extract
```
This would result in different behavior because `extract` is a different function that has a different implementation, and it may return a different value than `parse`.

DONE.
