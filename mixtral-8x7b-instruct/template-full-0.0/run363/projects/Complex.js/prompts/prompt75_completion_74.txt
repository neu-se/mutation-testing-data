 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let i = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares `i` using `let` instead of `var`, which could lead to different scoping behavior if the code around this block is modified to use a block-scoped construct like `if` or `for`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `i` to 1 instead of 0, which could cause the loop to be skipped entirely if the loop condition is dependent on the initial value of `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
for (i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the increment expression in a `for` loop, which could cause the loop to iterate indefinitely if the loop condition is not updated to account for the new loop structure.
