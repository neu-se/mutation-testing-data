  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `b`, which would change the result of the `sin` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the sign of the value of `b`, which would change the result of the `sin` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a` and `b`, which would change the result of the `sin` function.

DONE.
