  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.
```
This would result in different behavior because the period at the end of the line would cause the code to emit an event named "drain" rather than calling the "emit" method with an event named "drain".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fn
```
This would result in different behavior because the reference to "fn" would cause the code to emit an event named "fn" rather than calling the "emit" method with an event named "drain".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this["emit"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the square bracket notation would cause the code to emit an event named "emit" rather than calling the "emit" method with an event named "drain".

DONE.
