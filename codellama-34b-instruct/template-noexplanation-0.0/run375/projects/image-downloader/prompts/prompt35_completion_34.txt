  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest))
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `pipe` method to stream the response data directly to the `createWriteStream` function, which creates a writable stream to the file specified by `dest`. This can be a more efficient way to handle large files, as it avoids the need to load the entire file into memory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(dest))
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous option, but it uses the `fs` module to create the writable stream, rather than the `createWriteStream` function. This can be a more explicit way to create the stream, and it allows for more control over the stream's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'w' }))
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous options,
