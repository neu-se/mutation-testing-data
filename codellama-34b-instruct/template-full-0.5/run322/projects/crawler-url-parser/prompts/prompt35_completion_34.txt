  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prepend "https://" to the URL, regardless of whether it already has a protocol or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/\/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all instances of "//" from the URL, which could cause issues if the URL is not properly formatted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prepend "http://" to the URL, regardless of whether it already has a protocol or not.

DONE.
