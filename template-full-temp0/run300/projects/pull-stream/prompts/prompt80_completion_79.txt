  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbed` is always truthy, whereas `!cbed` checks if `cbed` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbed || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!cbed || abort` checks if `cbed` is falsy or `abort` is truthy, whereas `!cbed` only checks if `cbed` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbed && abort` checks if both `cbed` and `abort` are truthy, whereas `!cbed` only checks if `cbed` is falsy.

DONE.
