  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have an extra `null` element, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have an extra `undefined` element, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would have an extra `42` element, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

DONE.
