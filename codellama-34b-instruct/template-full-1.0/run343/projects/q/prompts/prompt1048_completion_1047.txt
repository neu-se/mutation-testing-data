  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the specified error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the specified error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Custom error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a custom error message.

DONE.
