 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return an empty array instead of potentially returning the keys of a given object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that the input is an object and tries to get its values, potentially causing a TypeError if the input is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(<PLACEHOLDER>).sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because it sorts the keys before mapping them to their corresponding values, which is not equivalent to simply mapping the keys to their values without sorting.

DONE.
