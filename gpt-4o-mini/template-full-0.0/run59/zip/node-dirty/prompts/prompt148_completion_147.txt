Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[] // an empty array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callbacks to never be executed, as there are no elements in the array to iterate over, potentially leading to unhandled errors if the write operation fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would lead to a TypeError when trying to iterate over it, as `null` is not iterable, which would disrupt the flow of the program and prevent any callbacks from being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would also lead to a TypeError when attempting to iterate over it, similar to using `null`, and would prevent any callbacks from being executed, potentially causing the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
