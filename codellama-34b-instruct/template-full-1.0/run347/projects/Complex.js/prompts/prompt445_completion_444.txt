  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```10, (places || 0) * 2```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `places` is being doubled, which would cause the rounded result to be off by a factor of 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```10, Math.sqrt(places || 0)```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `places` is being converted to a square root, which would cause the rounded result to be off by a factor of the square root of `places`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```10, Math.sin(places || 0)```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `places` is being converted to a sinusoid, which would cause the rounded result to be off by a factor of the sinusoid of `places`.

DONE.
