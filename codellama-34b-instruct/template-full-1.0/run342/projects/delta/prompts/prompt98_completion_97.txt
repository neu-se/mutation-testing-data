  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the code expects `newOp` to be an object, but would instead receive the number 123. This would likely cause errors in the code and potentially lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code expects `newOp` to be an object, but would instead receive the value `undefined`. This would likely cause errors in the code and potentially lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code expects `newOp` to be an object, but would instead receive the value `null`. This would likely cause errors in the code and potentially lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
