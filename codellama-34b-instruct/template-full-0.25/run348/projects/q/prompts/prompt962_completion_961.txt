  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `1` instead of `0`, which would cause the function to return a different array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `2` instead of `0`, which would cause the function to return a different array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `3` instead of `0`, which would cause the function to return a different array.

DONE.
