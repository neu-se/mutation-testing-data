  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `__esModule` property is set to `false`, which would cause the `define` function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": !define['amd']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `__esModule` property is set to the negation of `define['amd']`, which would cause the `define` function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": define['amd']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `__esModule` property is set to `define['amd']`, which would cause the `define` function to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
