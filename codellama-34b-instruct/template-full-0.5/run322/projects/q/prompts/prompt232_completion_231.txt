  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[2]` is a different element in the `operands` array than `operands[1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[1] + 1` is a different value than `operands[1]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `operands[1]`.

DONE.
