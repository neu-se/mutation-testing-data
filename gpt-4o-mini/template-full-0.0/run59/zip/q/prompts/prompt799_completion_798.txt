Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve with `null` instead of the original object, potentially leading to unexpected results in any subsequent promise chains that expect the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve with `undefined`, which may cause issues if the consumer of the promise is expecting a valid object or value to work with.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Progress error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving with the original object, the promise would be rejected with a new error, which would change the flow of execution and potentially lead to unhandled promise rejections if not properly caught.

DONE.
