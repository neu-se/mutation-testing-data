Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increase the length by 1, potentially causing the `transformPosition` method to skip over an operation or miscalculate the new index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the length by 1, which could lead to an incorrect index calculation, causing the method to incorrectly handle the position of operations in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length, which could cause the method to incorrectly process operations, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds index or incorrect transformations.

DONE.
