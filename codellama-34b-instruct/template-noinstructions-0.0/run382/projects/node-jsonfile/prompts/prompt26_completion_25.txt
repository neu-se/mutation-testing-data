  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error if the `reviver` parameter is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would use the default `reviver` function if the parameter is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would use a custom `reviver` function that always returns an empty object, regardless of the input.

DONE.
