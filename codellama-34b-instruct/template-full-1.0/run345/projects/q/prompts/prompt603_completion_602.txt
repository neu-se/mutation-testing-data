  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred = <PLACEHOLDER>;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `<PLACEHOLDER>` to `deferred`, rather than creating a new promise and assigning it to `deferred`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise = <PLACEHOLDER>;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `<PLACEHOLDER>` to `deferred.promise`, rather than creating a new promise and assigning it to `deferred.promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve = <PLACEHOLDER>;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `<PLACEHOLDER>` to `deferred.resolve`, rather than creating a new promise and assigning it to `deferred.resolve`.

DONE.
