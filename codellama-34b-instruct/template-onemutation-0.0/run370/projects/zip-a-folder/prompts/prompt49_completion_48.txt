  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called `finalize()` with a callback function that handles the error, while the new code fragment calls `finalize()` with `null`, which would cause the error to be ignored.
