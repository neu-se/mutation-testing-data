 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `test` argument to a string, changing how equality is checked in the `if(test(data))` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return test }
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps `test` in an anonymous function, changing the context and potentially affecting how `test` behaves if it relies on closure variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the global `test` variable, if it exists, instead of the `test` argument passed to the `find` function.

DONE.
