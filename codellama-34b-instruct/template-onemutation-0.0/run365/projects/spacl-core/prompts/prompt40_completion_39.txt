  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method with a regular expression that matches a forward slash, while the new code fragment uses the `split` method with a regular expression that matches a backslash. This would cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression and a different set of properties, which could result in different behavior when matching paths.

DONE.
