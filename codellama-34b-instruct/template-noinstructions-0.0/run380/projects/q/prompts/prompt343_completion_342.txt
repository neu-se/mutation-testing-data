  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is expected to call the `fulfilled` callback with the resolved value, but replacing it with `rejected` would cause it to call the `rejected` callback instead, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is expected to call the `fulfilled` callback with the resolved value, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause it to call the `rejected` callback with a `TypeError` exception, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is expected to call the `fulfilled` callback with the resolved value, but replacing it with `null` would cause it to call the `rejected` callback with a `TypeError` exception
