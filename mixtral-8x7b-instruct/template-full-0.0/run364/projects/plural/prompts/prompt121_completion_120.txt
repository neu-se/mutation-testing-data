 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/xics$/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words ending in 'xics', instead of 'ics'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/ics$/g, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'g' flag makes the regular expression global, causing it to match all occurrences of 'ics' in the word, instead of just the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 'a' }
