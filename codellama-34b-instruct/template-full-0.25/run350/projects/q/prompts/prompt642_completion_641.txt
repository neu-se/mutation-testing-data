  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(array_slice(arguments, 2))]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is called with a different argument, which would change the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(0, args.length - 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called with a different argument, which would change the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method is called on the `args` array, which would change the order of the elements in the array.

DONE.
