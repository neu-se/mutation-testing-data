  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `null`. This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, which leads to an error in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `undefined`. This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, which leads to an error in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `true`. This would result in different behavior because `true` is a boolean value and does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, which leads to an error in the code.

DONE.
