  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous code would count from the back of the string, while the new code would count from the front.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous code would start at the end of the string, while the new code would start at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous code would skip the last character in the string, while the new code would include it.

DONE.
