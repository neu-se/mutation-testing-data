  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not equal to `null`, so the callback would be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with a different argument.

DONE.
