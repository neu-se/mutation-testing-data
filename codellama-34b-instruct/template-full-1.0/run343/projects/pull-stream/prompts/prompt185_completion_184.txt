  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `false` instead of `true`, which could cause the callback to be triggered with a falsy value instead of a truthy one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` instead of `true`, which could cause the callback to be triggered with a falsy value instead of a truthy one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `undefined` instead of `true`, which could cause the callback to be triggered with a falsy value instead of a truthy one.

DONE.
