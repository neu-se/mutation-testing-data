  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the state of the promise instead of the fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().value === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the value of the promise instead of the state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is not fulfilled instead of if it is fulfilled.

DONE.
