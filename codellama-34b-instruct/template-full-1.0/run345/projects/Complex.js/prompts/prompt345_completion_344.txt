  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the mathematical constant pi, whereas `cosh` is a method that computes the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a special value in JavaScript that represents infinity, whereas `cosh` is a method that computes a hyperbolic cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents Not a Number, whereas `cosh` is a method that computes a hyperbolic cosine.

DONE.
