  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the rule matches the parent of the current context, rather than the current context itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.children
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the rule matches any of the children of the current context, rather than the current context itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.siblings
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the rule matches any of the siblings of the current context, rather than the current context itself.

DONE.
