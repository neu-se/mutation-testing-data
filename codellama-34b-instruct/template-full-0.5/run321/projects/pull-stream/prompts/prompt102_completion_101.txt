  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.warn` will log a warning message to the console instead of a normal log message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` will log an error message to the console instead of a normal log message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data, 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` will log the value of `data` and the string 'foo' to the console, instead of just the value of `data`.

DONE.
