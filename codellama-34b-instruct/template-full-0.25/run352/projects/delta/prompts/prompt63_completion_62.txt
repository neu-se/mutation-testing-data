  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty object, even if the original code fragment would have returned a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, even if the original code fragment would have returned a different object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return undefined, even if the original code fragment would have returned a different object.

DONE.
