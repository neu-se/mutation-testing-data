  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` is a method that returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, but it takes no arguments. Providing an argument would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` is a method that returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, but it takes no arguments. Providing an argument would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` is a method that advances the iterator to the next operation and returns the operation, but it takes no arguments. Providing an argument would cause a `TypeError` to be
