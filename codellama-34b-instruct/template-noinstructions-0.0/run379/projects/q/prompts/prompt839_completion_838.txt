  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to `deferred.reject`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with `null` instead of the expected error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to `deferred.reject`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with `undefined` instead of the expected error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a valid string value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to `deferred.reject`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the string `"foo"` instead of the expected error.

DONE.
