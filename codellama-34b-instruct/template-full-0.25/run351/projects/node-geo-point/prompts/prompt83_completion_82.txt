  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the result of the `asin` function, which is the inverse of the `sin` function. In contrast, `φ1` is the input to the `asin` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1 + 1` would add 1 to the input to the `asin` function, which would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1 * 2` would double the input to the `asin` function, which would change the result of the function.

DONE.
