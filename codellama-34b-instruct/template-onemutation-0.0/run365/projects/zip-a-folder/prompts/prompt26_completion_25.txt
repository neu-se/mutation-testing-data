  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(format, archiverOptions) && {}`, which would always return `archiverOptions` regardless of its value. In contrast, the original code fragment would return `{}` if `archiverOptions` is falsy.
