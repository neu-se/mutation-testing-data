  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' + 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for the presence of the `type` property with a value of `'Point'`, while the modified code is checking for the presence of the `type` property with a value of `'PointPoint'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for the presence of the `type` property with a value of `'Point'`, while the modified code is checking for the presence of the `type` property with a value of `'PointPoint'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for the presence of the `type` property with a value of `'Point'`, while the modified code is checking for the presence of the `type` property with a value of `'Point-1'`.
