  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `+` operator, which would result in the concatenation of the two arrays. However, using the `-` operator would result in the difference between the two arrays, which is a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `+` operator, which would result in the concatenation of the two arrays. However, using the `0` operator would result in the multiplication of the two arrays, which is a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `+` operator, which would result in the concatenation of the two arrays. However, using the `1` operator would result in the addition of the two arrays, which is a different behavior.

DONE.
