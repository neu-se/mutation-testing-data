  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not being called on the correct object. In the original code, `fail` is called on the promise returned by `fapply`, but in this modified code, it is called on the `deferred` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not being called on the correct object. In the original code, `fail` is called on the promise returned by `fapply`, but in this modified code, it is called on the `deferred` object.
