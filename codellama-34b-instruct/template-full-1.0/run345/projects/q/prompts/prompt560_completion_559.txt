  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration !==
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is not a defined variable, so the code would return a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!== bool
```
This would result in different behavior because `bool` is not a defined variable, so the code would return a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration ^=
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is not a defined variable, so the code would return a reference error.

DONE.
