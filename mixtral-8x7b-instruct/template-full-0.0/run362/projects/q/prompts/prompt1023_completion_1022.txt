 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return Q.nodeify.call(null, object, nodeback);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context (`this`) of the `nodeify` function to `null`, which might cause issues if `nodeify` relies on the correct context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return Q.nodeify(nodeback, object);
