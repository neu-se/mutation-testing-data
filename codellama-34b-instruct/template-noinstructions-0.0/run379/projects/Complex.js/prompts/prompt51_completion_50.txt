  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` is the negation of `Number.isFinite`, which means that it will return `true` if the argument is not a finite number, and `false` if it is a finite number. This would cause the code to behave differently than the original code, which would return `true` if the argument is a finite number, and `false` if it is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a function that checks if the argument is NaN (Not a Number), and it would return `true` if the argument is NaN, and `false` if it is not. This would cause the code to behave differently than the original code, which would return `true` if the argument is a finite number, and `false` if it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
