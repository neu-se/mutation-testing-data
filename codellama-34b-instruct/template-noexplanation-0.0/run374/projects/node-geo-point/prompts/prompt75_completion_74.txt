  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(bearing) + 180
```
This code fragment will add 180 degrees to the bearing, which will result in a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(bearing) * 2
```
This code fragment will double the bearing, which will result in a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(bearing) - 180
```
This code fragment will subtract 180 degrees from the bearing, which will result in a different destination point.

DONE.
