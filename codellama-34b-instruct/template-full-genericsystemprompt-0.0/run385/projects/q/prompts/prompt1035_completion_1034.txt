  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind(object, name, args).nodeify(nodeback);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` returns a promise, and `nodeify` is a method that can be called on a promise to convert it to a Node.js-style callback. In this case, the `nodeback` function would be called with the result of the promise, rather than the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.npost(object, name, args).nodeify(nodeback);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.npost` returns a promise, and `nodeify` is a method that can be called on a promise to convert it to a Node.js-style callback. In this case, the `nodeback` function would be called with the result of the promise, rather than the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.ninvoke(object, name, args).
