  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method checks if the complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, while the `isNaN` method checks if the complex number is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while the `isNaN` method checks if the complex number is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property returns the real part of the complex number, while the `isNaN` method checks if the complex number is not a number.

DONE.
