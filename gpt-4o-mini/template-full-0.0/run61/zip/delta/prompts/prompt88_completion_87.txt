Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are numbers instead of strings, which would cause the condition to fail for string inputs, leading to incorrect handling of insert operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'string' ||
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical OR operator instead of AND, meaning that the condition would pass if either `newOp.insert` or `lastOp.insert` is a string, potentially allowing unintended combinations of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert !== lastOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for inequality between `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert`, which would prevent the merging of operations even if both are strings and should logically be combined, leading to a different outcome in the operation handling.

DONE.
