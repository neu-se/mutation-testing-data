 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, zoom - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` function would receive a different `zoom` level than the original implementation, which could lead to incorrect tile calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, 'zoom']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` function expects a number as the second argument, but would receive a string 'zoom' instead, causing a runtime error or incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
['not this', zoom]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` function expects a `GeoPoint` object as the first argument, but would receive a string 'not this' instead, causing a runtime error or incorrect calculations.

DONE.
