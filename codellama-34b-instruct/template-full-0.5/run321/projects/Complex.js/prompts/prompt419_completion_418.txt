  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](NaN)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for zero, but this new code fragment checks for NaN (Not a Number).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](null)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for zero, but this new code fragment checks for null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for zero, but this new code fragment checks for 1.

DONE.
