  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite of the original code, which could lead to incorrect results in the `fromGeoJSON` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `coordinates` property exists, rather than checking if the `type` property exists and if it has the value `'Point'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `type` property has the value `'Point'`, rather than checking if the `coordinates` property exists.

DONE.
