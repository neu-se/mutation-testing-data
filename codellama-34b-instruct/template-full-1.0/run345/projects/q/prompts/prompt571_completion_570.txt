  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, but replacing it with an empty function would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply = function () {return this();};
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, causing the function to be called with the wrong `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply = function (args) {return this(args);};
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with arguments that are not provided, causing it to behave differently.

DONE.
