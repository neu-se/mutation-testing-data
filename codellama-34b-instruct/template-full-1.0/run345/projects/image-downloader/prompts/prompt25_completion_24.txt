  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname, options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because path.dirname returns the directory name of a path, rather than the absolute path as path.resolve does. This could silently change the behavior of the code and potentially introduce bugs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname + path.sep + options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because path.dirname does not guarantee a trailing separator, so this expression would always return an absolute path, whereas the original code would return a path relative to the current working directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest) + path.sep + path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only keep the basename of the destination path, rather than the entire path.

DONE.
