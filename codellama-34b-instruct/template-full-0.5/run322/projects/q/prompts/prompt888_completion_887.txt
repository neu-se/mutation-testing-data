  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be populated with the values `0` and `void 0`, whereas the new code fragment would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be populated with the values `1` and `void 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be populated with the values `0` and `void 0`, whereas the new code fragment would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be populated with the values `2` and `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be populated with the values `0` and `void 0`, whereas the new code
