  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `==` operator instead of `===`, which can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values that are not of the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `!==` operator instead of `===`, which can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values that are not of the same type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout.valueOf() === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `valueOf()` method to convert the `timeout` value to a primitive value, which can lead to unexpected behavior when the `timeout` value is not a primitive value.
