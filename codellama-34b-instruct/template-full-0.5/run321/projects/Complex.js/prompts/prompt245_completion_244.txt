  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re']` is the real part of the complex number, while `this['im']` is the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['abs']()` returns the magnitude of the complex number, while `this['im']` returns the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['arg']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['arg']()` returns the angle of the complex number, while `this['im']` returns the imaginary part.

DONE.
