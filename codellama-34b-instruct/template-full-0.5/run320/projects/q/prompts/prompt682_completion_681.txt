  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code would have caused it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value "foo", whereas the original code would have caused it to be resolved with the value of the `object` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the `object` variable, whereas the original code would have caused it to be resolved with the value of the `object` variable.

DONE.
