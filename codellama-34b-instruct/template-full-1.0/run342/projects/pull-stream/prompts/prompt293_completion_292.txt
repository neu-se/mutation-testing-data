  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'object' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the branch where `ended` is changed to `true` to always be executed, regardless of the value of `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'array' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the branch where `ended` is changed to `true` to always be executed, regardless of the value of `test`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the branch where `ended` is changed to `true` to always be executed, regardless of the value of `test`.

DONE.
