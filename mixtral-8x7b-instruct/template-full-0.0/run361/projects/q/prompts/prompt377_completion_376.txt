 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` call would no longer receive a value, potentially causing issues if the `progressed` callback expects a value to be passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the value passed to the `deferred.notify` call, potentially causing issues if the `progressed` callback expects a specific type or format of value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(newValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would wrap the value in a new promise, potentially causing issues if the `progressed` callback does not expect a promise to be passed.

DONE.
