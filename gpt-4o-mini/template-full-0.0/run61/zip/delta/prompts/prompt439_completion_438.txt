Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.retain` is a string instead of checking if it is an object and not null, which would lead to incorrect handling of retain operations that are objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly checks if `nextOp.retain` is null, which would incorrectly allow null values to be treated as valid retain operations, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.retain` is undefined, which would skip valid retain operations that are defined, leading to incorrect processing of the operations.

DONE.
