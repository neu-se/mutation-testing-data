  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different operation than `delete`, and it would cause the `transform` method to retain the text instead of deleting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to retain the text one position earlier than it should, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to retain the text starting from the beginning of the document, instead of starting from the current position.

DONE.
