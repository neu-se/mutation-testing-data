  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the index instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to run indefinitely or not at all, depending on the initial value of the index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, potentially missing some elements or iterating over the same element multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would reset the index to 0 every time it iterates, causing the loop to run indefinitely or not at all, depending on the initial value of the index.

DONE.
