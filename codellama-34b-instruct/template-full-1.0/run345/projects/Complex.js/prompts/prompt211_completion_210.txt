  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment referred to the `b` variable, while the replacement fragment refers to the `a` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment referred to a single variable, while the replacement fragment performs an addition operation on two variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment referred to a single variable, while the replacement fragment performs a division operation on two variables.

DONE.
