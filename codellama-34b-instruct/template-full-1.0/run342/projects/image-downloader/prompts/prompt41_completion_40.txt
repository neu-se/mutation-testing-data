  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function to end the Promise, while `reject` is a function to indicate that the Promise has failed. In the original code, `reject` is used to handle the error case, so replacing it with `resolve` would result in a successful Promise resolution even if the request fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve({filename: dest})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the Promise with an object containing the file name, while the original code would only resolve the Promise with the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.filename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `filename` property of the `file` object, while the original code would only resolve the Promise with the file name.

DONE.
