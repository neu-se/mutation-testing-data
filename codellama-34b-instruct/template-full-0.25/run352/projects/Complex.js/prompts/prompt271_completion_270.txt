  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['im'], this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `Math.atan2` are swapped, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['im'], -this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `Math.atan2` is negated, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['im'], Math.PI/2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `Math.atan2` is a constant, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
