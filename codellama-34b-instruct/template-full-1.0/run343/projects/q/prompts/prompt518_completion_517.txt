  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise immediately, instead of rejecting it, which would cause the promise chain to continue and return a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.then` would return a new promise that is resolved with the value returned by the provided callback function, which would cause the promise chain to continue and return a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.all().then(function(values) { return values; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.all` would return a new promise that is resolved with an array of values from the provided promises, which would cause the promise chain to continue and return a resolved promise.

DONE.
