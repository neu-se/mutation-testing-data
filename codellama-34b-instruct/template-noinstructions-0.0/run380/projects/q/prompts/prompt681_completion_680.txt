  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` context would be different, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, potentially causing the function to return a different array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with a different context and a different array of arguments, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

DONE.
