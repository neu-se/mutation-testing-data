Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the longitude of `point1` instead of the difference in longitude (`Δλ`), which would lead to incorrect calculations for the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively ignores the difference in longitude altogether, leading to a constant bearing value regardless of the actual points being compared.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the latitude of `point2` instead of the difference in longitude (`Δλ`), which would distort the bearing calculation and yield incorrect results.

DONE.
