  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the equality operator instead of the identity operator. This change may cause the code to behave differently in certain cases, such as when `a` is a non-zero number that is very close to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This code fragment is the opposite of the original, and it checks whether `a` is not equal to zero. This change may cause the code to behave differently in certain cases, such as when `a` is a non-zero number that is very close to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This code fragment checks whether `a` is greater than zero. This change may cause the code to behave differently in certain cases, such as when `a` is a negative number that is very close to zero.

DONE.
