  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would continue indefinitely, causing the program to hang.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbed
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would continue until `cbed` is false, which would never happen if `read` is always called with a truthy value for `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!read
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would continue until `read` is false, which would never happen if `read` is always called with a truthy value for `end`.

DONE.
