  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the `policies` array, which could potentially cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the policies in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the `policies` array, which could potentially cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over a different array than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map()` method returns a new array containing the result of the callback function for each element in the `policies` array, which could potentially cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over a different array than expected.

DONE.
