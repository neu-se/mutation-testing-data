  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `ended` is truthy or if `end` is truthy, but this new code only checks if `end` is truthy. If `end` is falsy, the function will return without checking if `ended` is truthy, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `end` is truthy, but this new code checks if `end` is truthy or if `true` is truthy. If `end` is falsy, the function will return `true`, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `ended` is truthy or if `end` is truthy, but this new code checks if `end
