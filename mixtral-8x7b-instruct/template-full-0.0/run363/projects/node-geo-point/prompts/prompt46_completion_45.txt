 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, instead of converting the latitude to radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of PI/2, instead of converting the latitude to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(input) => input
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not perform any conversion, but instead return the input value directly.

DONE.
