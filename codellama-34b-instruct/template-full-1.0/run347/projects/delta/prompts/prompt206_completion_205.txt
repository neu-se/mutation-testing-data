  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ThereIsALotOfSpace.push
``` 
This would result in different behavior because `ThereIsALotOfSpace` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(thisOp.retain - firstLeft)
``` 
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` returns the next operation in the iterator and `firstLeft` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.insert
``` 
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.insert()` is a method that inserts a new operation at the current position of the iterator, and is not the same as `otherIter.next()`.

DONE.
