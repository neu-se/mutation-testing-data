  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert("\n");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a newline character at the end of the delta, whereas the original code would not insert anything.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the first character of the delta, whereas the original code would not delete anything.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta[0].insert = "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the string "foo" at the beginning of the delta, whereas the original code would not insert anything.

DONE.
