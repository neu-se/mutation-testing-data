  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` and `data` arguments, whereas the original code fragment only called `cb` with the `end` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with three arguments, whereas the original code fragment only called it with two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data, 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a third argument, whereas the original code fragment did not include a third argument.

DONE.
