Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error('Archive creation failed.'));
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise when the archive is successfully created, it will reject the promise with an error message, indicating that the operation failed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve('Archive created successfully.');
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with a string message instead of resolving it without any value, which could lead to confusion in the handling of the promise's resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with a `null` value instead of resolving it without any value, which may lead to different handling in the promise chain, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the calling code.

DONE.
