  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with an incorrect number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with incorrect arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with an incorrect `this` binding.

DONE.
