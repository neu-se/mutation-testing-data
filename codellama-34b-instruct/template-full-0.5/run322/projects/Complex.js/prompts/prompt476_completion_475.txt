  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isFinite` is the negation of `isFinite`, and it would return `true` for values that are not finite, such as `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity`, while `isFinite` would return `false` for those values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is the negation of `isFinite`, and it would return `true` for values that are infinite, such as `Infinity` and `-Infinity`, while `isFinite` would return `false` for those values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNan
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNan` is the negation of `isFinite`, and it would return `true` for values that are `NaN`, while `isFinite
