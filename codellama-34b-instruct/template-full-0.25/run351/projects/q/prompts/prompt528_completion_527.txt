  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () { return object; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).all()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
