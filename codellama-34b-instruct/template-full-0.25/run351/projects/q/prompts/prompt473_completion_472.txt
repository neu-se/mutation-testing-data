  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array instead of the element at the index `atReport`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array instead of the element at the index `atReport`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the element at index `atReport * 2` instead of the element at index `atReport`.

DONE.
