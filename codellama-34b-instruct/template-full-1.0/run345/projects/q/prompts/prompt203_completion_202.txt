  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
13
```
This would result in different behavior because "13" is not a valid JavaScript operator, and would cause a syntax error in the code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
*
```
This would result in different behavior because the "*" operator is the multiplication operator, and would cause the code to perform multiplication instead of string concatenation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+
```
This would result in different behavior because the "+" operator is the addition operator, and would cause the code to perform addition instead of string concatenation.

DONE.
