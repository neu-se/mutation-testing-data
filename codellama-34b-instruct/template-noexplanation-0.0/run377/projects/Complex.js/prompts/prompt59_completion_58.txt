  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This code fragment will always return the opposite of the original `Number.isFinite` function, which checks if a value is a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This code fragment will always return the opposite of the original `Number.isFinite` function, which checks if a value is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isSafeInteger
```
This code fragment will always return the opposite of the original `Number.isFinite` function, which checks if a value is a finite number.

DONE.
