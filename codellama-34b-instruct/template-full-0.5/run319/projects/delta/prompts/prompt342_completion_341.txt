  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.insert` is a string, and `Op.length` expects an object with a `length` property, so it would return `undefined` instead of the intended value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert.indexOf(newline)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a string, and `indexOf` expects a string to search for, so it would return `-1` instead of the intended value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert.indexOf(newline, start)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a string, and `indexOf` expects a string to search for, so it would return `-1` instead of the intended value.

DONE.
