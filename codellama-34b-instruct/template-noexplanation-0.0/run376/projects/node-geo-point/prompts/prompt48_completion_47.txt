  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2)
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2)
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 180
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the application.

DONE.
