  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.filter(function (el) {
	return el !== reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all elements from the `unhandledReasons` array that are equal to `reason`, rather than adding a new element to the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.concat(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `reason` object with the `unhandledReasons` array, rather than pushing a new element to the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.slice().concat(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the `unhandledReasons` array, concatenate `reason` with the copy, and return the resulting array, rather than modifying the original array.

DONE.
