  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next 10 elements in the iterator, potentially causing the algorithm to miss important information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the algorithm to loop indefinitely, as the iterator would never reach the end of the sequence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the algorithm to skip over the first element in the iterator, potentially causing the algorithm to miss important information.

DONE.
