  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, which means that the `if` statement would be evaluated as `true` even if `abort` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator evaluates to `true` if either of its operands is `true`, so the `if` statement would be evaluated as `true` even if `abort` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator evaluates to `false` if either of its operands is `false`, so the `if` statement would be evaluated as `false` even if `abort` is `true`.

DONE.
