  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, and in this case, it would return all elements of the `args` array except the first one. This would cause the `nmapply` method to pass the wrong arguments to the `post` method, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array that is the result of merging the `args` array with itself. This would cause the `nmapply` method to pass duplicate arguments to the `post` method, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method returns a new array that is the result of reversing
