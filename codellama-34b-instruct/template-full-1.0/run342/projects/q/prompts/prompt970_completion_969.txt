  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"differentMethod"
```
This would result in different behavior because `npost` would attempt to call the "differentMethod" method of the object instead of the "name" method, which might not exist or have different parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug!")
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error instead of calling the method, which would cause the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"name".toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would call the "toUpperCase" method of the "name" string instead of the "name" method of the object, which would return a different value.

DONE.
