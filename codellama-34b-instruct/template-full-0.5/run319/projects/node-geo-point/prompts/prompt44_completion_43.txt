  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(r - 1) * 6371392.896
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `acos` to calculate the arc cosine of `r`, which is a value between -1 and 1. However, the replaced code fragment uses `r - 1` as the argument to `acos`, which is a value outside of the valid range for `acos`. This would cause the function to return an incorrect value, leading to incorrect calculations in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(r + 1) * 6371392.896
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `acos` to calculate the arc cosine of `r`, which is a value between -1 and 1. However, the replaced code fragment uses `r + 1` as the argument to `acos`, which is a value outside of the valid range for `acos`. This would cause
