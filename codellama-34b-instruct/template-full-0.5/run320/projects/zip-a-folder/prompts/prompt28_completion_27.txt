  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` event is emitted when all data has been flushed to the underlying system, while the `close` event is emitted when the stream and any of its underlying resources have been closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs, while the `close` event is emitted when the stream and any of its underlying resources have been closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the stream has reached the end of the data to be written, while the `close` event is emitted when the stream and any of its underlying resources have been closed.

DONE.
