  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "function"
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `else if` block, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "undefined"
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "object" && typeof module.exports === "function"
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block, which is the desired behavior.

DONE.
