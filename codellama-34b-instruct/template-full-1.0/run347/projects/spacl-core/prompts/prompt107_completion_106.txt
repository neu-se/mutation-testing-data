  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- path
+ path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.split("")` returns an array of characters in the path, whereas `path` returns a string. This change would likely cause the `query` method to return different results for the same input, leading to a decrease in the accuracy of the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- path
+ `${path}`.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because `${path}`.split("") returns an array of characters in the path, whereas `path` returns a string. This change would likely cause the `query` method to return different results for the same input, leading to a decrease in the accuracy of the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- path
+ path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.length` returns the length of the path as a number, whereas `path` returns a string
