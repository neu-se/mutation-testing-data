  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dest` variable is not modified, and the `foo` string is concatenated to the end of the `dest` variable, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dest` variable is converted to uppercase, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dest` variable is split on the `.` character and the first element of the resulting array is used, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
