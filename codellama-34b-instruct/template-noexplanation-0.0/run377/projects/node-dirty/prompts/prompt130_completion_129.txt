  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.shift();
```
This change will cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the `this._queue` array, and for each iteration, it will assign the first element of the array to the `key` variable and the second element to the `cbs` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.pop();
```
This change will cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the `this._queue` array in reverse order, and for each iteration, it will assign the last element of the array to the `key` variable and the second-to-last element to the `cbs` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.slice(0, 2);
```
This change will cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the first two elements of the
