```
cheerio.load(data, { decodeEntities: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `decodeEntities` option is set to `false`, which means that HTML entities in the input data will not be decoded. This could cause the `extract` function to return different results, depending on the input data and the expected behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
cheerio.load(data, { xmlMode: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `xmlMode` option
