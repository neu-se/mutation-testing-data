  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the starting point instead of the longitude of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the longitude of the destination point, which would cause the destination point to be on the opposite side of the globe.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 180 degrees from the longitude of the destination point, which would cause the destination point to be on the opposite side of the globe.

DONE.
