Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content = content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the content to uppercase, which would change the JSON structure if the original content had any lowercase keys or values, potentially causing `JSON.parse` to fail or return a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content = content.replace(/"/g, "'")
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces double quotes with single quotes in the JSON string, which would make the string invalid JSON, leading to a parsing error in `JSON.parse`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content = content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first character of the content string, which could corrupt the JSON structure, causing `JSON.parse` to throw an error or return an unexpected object.

DONE.
