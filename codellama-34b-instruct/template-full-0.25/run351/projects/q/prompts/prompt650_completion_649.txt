  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function is not defined, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function is not defined, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

DONE.
