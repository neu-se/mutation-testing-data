  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
δ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to δ would cause the calculation of the destination point to be off by a small amount.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
δ - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from δ would cause the calculation of the destination point to be off by a small amount.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
δ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by δ would cause the calculation of the destination point to be off by a large amount.

DONE.
