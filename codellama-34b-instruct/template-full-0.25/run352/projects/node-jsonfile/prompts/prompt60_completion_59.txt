  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) && content.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `content` is a buffer, while the modified code fragment also checks if the buffer has a length greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `content` is a buffer, while the modified code fragment checks if `content` is not a buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf8').startsWith('\uFEFF')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the first character of `content` is the UTF-8 BOM character, while the modified code fragment checks if the first character of the UTF-8 representation of `content` is the UTF-8 BOM character.

DONE.
