  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected = function (object) {
    return object === null;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a value of `null` to be rejected, which would cause the `isRejected` function to return `true`. This would lead to inconsistent behavior with the rest of the code, where `null` is considered a resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected = function (object) {
    return !object;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any falsy value (such as `null`, `undefined`, `0`, or an empty string) to be rejected. This would cause the `isRejected` function to return `true` for any falsy value, which would lead to inconsistent behavior with the rest of the code, where these values are considered resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected = function (object
