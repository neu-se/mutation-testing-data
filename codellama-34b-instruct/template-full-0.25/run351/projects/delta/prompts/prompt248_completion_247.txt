  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff algorithm to use the length of the other delta's operations instead of the length of the current delta's operations, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff algorithm to consider one more operation than it should, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff algorithm to consider one fewer operation than it should, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
