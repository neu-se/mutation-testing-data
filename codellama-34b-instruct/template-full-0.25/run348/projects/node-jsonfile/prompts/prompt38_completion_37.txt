  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is a different function than `universalify.fromCallback`. The former takes a promise as an argument, while the latter takes a callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fs.writeFile` function with a callback function, which is not the same as calling it with a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fs.writeFileSync` function with a callback function, which is not the same as calling it with a promise.

DONE.
