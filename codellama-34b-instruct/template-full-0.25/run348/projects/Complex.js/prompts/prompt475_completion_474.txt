  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re']` refers to the real part of the complex number, whereas `this['im']` refers to the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im'] + 1` would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `this['im']` refers to the imaginary part as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im'] * 2` would double the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `this['im']` refers to the imaginary part as is.

DONE.
