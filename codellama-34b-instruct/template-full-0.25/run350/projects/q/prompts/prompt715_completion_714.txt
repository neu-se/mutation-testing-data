  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.undefined` is not a valid property access and would throw a `TypeError` exception, whereas `object` is a valid property access and would return the value of the `object` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.null
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.null` is not a valid property access and would throw a `TypeError` exception, whereas `object` is a valid property access and would return the value of the `object` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.undefined.undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.undefined.undefined` is not a valid property access and would throw a `TypeError` exception, whereas `object` is a valid property access and would return the value of the `object` property.

DONE.
