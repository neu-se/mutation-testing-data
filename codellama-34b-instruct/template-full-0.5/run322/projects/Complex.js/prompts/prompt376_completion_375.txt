  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is equivalent to `2 * a`, but the new code fragment is equivalent to `1 / a`, which is the reciprocal of `2 * a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is equivalent to `2 * a`, but the new code fragment is equivalent to `a * b`, which is the product of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is equivalent to `2 * a`, but the new code fragment is equivalent to `a + b`, which is the sum of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
