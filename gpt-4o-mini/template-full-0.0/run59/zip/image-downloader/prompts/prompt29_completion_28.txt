Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force all requests to use the HTTP protocol instead of HTTPS, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities and failure to connect to secure endpoints.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the URL as a string literal rather than a protocol identifier, causing the request to fail since it would not match the expected protocol format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to use the FTP protocol for the request, which is not supported by the `http` or `https` modules, leading to an error when trying to make the request.

DONE.
