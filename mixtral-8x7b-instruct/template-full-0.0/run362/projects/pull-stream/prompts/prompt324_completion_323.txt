 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function would always be called with the argument `true`, regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function would always be called with the argument `42`, regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function would always be called with a string representation of the `abort` value, rather than the boolean value itself.

DONE.
