Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the new operation to be pushed to the `ops` array even when the index is greater than the current length, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the new operation to be pushed to the `ops` array even when the index is not equal to the current length, which could lead to duplicate entries or incorrect ordering of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the new operation from being added if the index is less than the second-to-last position, which could lead to loss of operations that should be added to the array.

DONE.
