  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `value`, which would return the fulfilled value, while `null` would return a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `value`, which would return the fulfilled value, while `undefined` would return an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `value`, which would return the fulfilled value, while `throw new Error()` would throw an error.

DONE.
