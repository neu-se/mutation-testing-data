 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next.bind(thisIter)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately invokes the `next` method and passes the result to `thisOp`, instead of assigning the `next` method to `thisOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter['next']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `next` property as a string key, which would work if the `OpIterator` had a `next` property, but it doesn't.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `peek` method instead of the `next` method, which would cause an infinite loop since `peek` does not advance the iterator.

DONE.
