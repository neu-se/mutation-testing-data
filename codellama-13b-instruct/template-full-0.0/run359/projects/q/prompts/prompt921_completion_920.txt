  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the modified code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors and also calls the `reject` method on the `deferred` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the modified code fragment uses the `then` method to handle both success and error cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).done(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the modified code fragment
