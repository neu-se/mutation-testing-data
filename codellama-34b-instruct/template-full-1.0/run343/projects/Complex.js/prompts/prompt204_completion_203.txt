  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `b` variable, which may contain a different value than `2b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `b` variable, which may contain a different value than `b-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `b` variable, which may contain a different value than `-b`.

DONE.
