  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the UTF-8 byte order mark (BOM) from the content, whereas the original code fragment `stripBom` would remove the BOM from the beginning of the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the content, whereas the original code fragment `stringify` would convert the content to a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a null value, whereas the original code fragment `stringify` would return a non-null value.

DONE.
