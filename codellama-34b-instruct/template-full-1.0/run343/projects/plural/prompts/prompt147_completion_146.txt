  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
just rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the `plural` function would always be the first rule[1] instead of the actual rule applied to the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].slice(0,1).toUpperCase() + rule[1][1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a new string with the first character in uppercase and the result would be concatenated with the second character of the rule[1] array, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.length < 0 ? rule[1] : rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would check if the length of the `rules` array is less than 0, which is always false, and return the first element of the `rule` array instead of the actual rule applied to the
