  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while the mutated code fragment checks if it is not a string. This change would cause the `retain` branch of the `if` statement to be taken when `nextOp.insert` is not a string, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
