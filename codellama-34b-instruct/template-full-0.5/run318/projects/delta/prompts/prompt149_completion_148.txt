  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is now checking if the result of the subtraction is less than zero, which would be the case if `firstLeft` is greater than `firstOther.retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is now checking if the result of the subtraction is equal to zero, which would be the case if `firstLeft` is equal to `firstOther.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is now checking if the result of the subtraction is not equal to zero, which would be the case if `firstLeft` is not equal to `firstOther.retain`.

DONE.
