  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the contents of the current operation, rather than pushing it to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the contents of the current operation, rather than pushing it to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the contents of the current operation, rather than pushing it to the delta.

DONE.
