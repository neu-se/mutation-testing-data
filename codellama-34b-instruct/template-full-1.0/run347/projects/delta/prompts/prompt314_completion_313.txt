  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.delete` would remove the inserted content, while `inverted.retain` would keep it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.delete` would remove the inserted content, while `inverted.push` would insert it again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.delete` would remove the inserted content, while `delta.delete` would remove the retained content.

DONE.
