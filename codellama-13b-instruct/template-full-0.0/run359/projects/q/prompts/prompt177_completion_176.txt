  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.indexOf("(module.js:") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for any stack line that contains the string "(module.js:", regardless of whether it is actually a node frame or not. This could cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `true` for stack lines that are not actually internal frames, which could lead to incorrect filtering of stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.indexOf("(node.js:") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for any stack line that contains the string "(node.js:", regardless of whether it is actually a node frame or not. This could cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `true` for stack lines that are not actually internal frames, which could lead to incorrect filtering of stack traces.
