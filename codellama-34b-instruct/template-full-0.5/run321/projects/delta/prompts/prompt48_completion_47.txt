  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `embedType` is not equal to the first key of `b`, regardless of whether `b` has any keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.keys(b).includes(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `b` does not have a key equal to `embedType`, instead of only returning `true` if `embedType` is not equal to the first key of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length === 0 || !Object.keys(b).includes(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `b` does not have any keys or if it does not have a key equal to `embedType`, instead of only returning `true` if `
