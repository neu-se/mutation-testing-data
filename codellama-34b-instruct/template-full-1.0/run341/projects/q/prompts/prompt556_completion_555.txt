  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.error` will always be `undefined`, whereas `result.value` will contain the promise's result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, whereas `result.value` contains the promise's result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.reject` is a function that rejects the promise, whereas `result.value` contains the promise's result.

DONE.
