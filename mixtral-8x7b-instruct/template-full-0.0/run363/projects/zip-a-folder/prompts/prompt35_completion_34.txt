 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive.bulk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bulk()` is not a method of the `archiver.Archiver` class, and it would throw an error when executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive.finalize().pipe(output)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of piping and finalizing the archive is changed, which might cause issues depending on the event listeners attached to the `archiver.Archiver` instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive['_events']['error'] = undefined;
zipArchive.pipe(output)
```
This would result in different behavior because removing the 'error' event listener from the `archiver.Archiver` instance would prevent any error handling when compressing files, potentially causing issues to go unnoticed.

DONE.
