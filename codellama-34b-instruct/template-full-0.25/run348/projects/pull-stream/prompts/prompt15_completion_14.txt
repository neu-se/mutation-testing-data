  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is always an array, so the check `args == null` would always fail, while `args === undefined` would pass if `args` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` would always be 0 if `args` is an empty array, while `args == null` would only pass if `args` is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `!args.length` would pass if `args` is an empty array, while `args == null` would only pass if `args` is null or undefined.

DONE.
