  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the key and value to be assigned to each other.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the key is being set to itself, which would not cause any changes to the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key is not being passed as an argument, which would cause an error.

DONE.
