  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.promiseDispatch` is not a function, whereas `this.dispatch` is a function that is defined in the `Promise.prototype` object. If `this.promiseDispatch` were called, it would throw a `TypeError` because it is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatc
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatc` is not a function, whereas `this.dispatch` is a function that is defined in the `Promise.prototype` object. If `this.dispatc` were called, it would throw a `TypeError` because it is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (deferred, resolve, op, args) {
    return deferred(resolve, op, args);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function that is passed
