  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick` would not be passed a function, which could cause issues in the `when` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because a string value would be passed to `Q.nextTick`, which could cause issues in the `when` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because a null value would be passed to `Q.nextTick`, which could cause issues in the `when` function.

DONE.
