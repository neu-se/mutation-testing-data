  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `op`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `op` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a short-circuit operator, meaning that if the first operand is `false`, the second operand will not be evaluated. In this case, if `op` is `false`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, even if the second operand is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a short-circuit operator, meaning that if the first operand is `true`, the second operand will not be evaluated. In this case, if `op` is `true`, the `if` statement would
