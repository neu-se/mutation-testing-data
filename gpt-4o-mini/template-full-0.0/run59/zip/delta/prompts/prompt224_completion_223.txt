Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the cursor position as zero, potentially causing incorrect diffs by starting from the beginning of the strings instead of the actual cursor position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` would lead to unexpected results in the diff calculation, as the function may not handle `undefined` properly, potentially causing runtime errors or incorrect diffs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the cursor position by one, causing the diffing process to skip the first character of the strings, leading to incorrect diff results.

DONE.
