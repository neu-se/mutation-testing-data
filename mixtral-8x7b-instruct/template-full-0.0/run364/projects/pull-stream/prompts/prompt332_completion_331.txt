 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `else once(end)` statement will no longer guarantee that `once` function is called with the correct `end` parameter. If `end` is falsy but not `undefined`, the `once` function will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function will be called with `null` as the `end` parameter, which might not be the expected behavior in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function will be called with an empty object as the `end` parameter, which is not the same as the original `end` value. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code.

DONE.
