  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method would be called with a null error, which would cause the write stream to be destroyed without any error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Test error')));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method would be called with a test error, which would cause the write stream to be destroyed and emit an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method would be called with an undefined error, which would cause the write stream to be destroyed without any error handling.

DONE.
