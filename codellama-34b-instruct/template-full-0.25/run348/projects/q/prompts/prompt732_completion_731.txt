  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed immediately, even if there are still pending promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed only if there are still pending promises, which would cause the function to return a promise that is never resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed only if all promises have been resolved, which would cause the function to return a promise that is never resolved.

DONE.
