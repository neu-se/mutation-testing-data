  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ZipAFolder.compress({src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed}});
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level is set to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, which means that the archive will not be compressed at all, even if the `compression` option is set to a different value in the `ZipAFolderOptions` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ZipAFolder.compress({src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high}});
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level is set to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high`, which means that the archive will be compressed at the highest level, even if the `compression` option is set to a different value in the
