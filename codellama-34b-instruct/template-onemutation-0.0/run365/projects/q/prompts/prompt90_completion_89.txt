  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is uncurried, meaning it takes all its arguments as a single array. In this case, `uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)` would return a function that takes an array as its first argument and returns a new array that is a slice of the original array.

DONE.
