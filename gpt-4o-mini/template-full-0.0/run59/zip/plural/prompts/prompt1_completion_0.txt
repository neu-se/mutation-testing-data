Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(0, 5)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the length of the string returned by `slice`, potentially returning an incomplete type string instead of the full type descriptor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the type string to uppercase, which may not match the expected lowercase format used in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).split(' ')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it extracts only the second part of the type string, which may not correspond to the expected format and could lead to incorrect type identification.

DONE.
