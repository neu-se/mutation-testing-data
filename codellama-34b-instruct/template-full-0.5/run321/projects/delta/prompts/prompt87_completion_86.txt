  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newOp.attributes` property would always be set to the value of `lastOp.attributes`, regardless of whether `newOp.insert` is a string or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = Object.assign({}, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign()` creates a shallow copy of `lastOp.attributes`, which means that any changes made to `newOp.attributes` would not affect `lastOp.attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = Object.assign({}, lastOp.attributes, {
  insert: newOp.insert
})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign()` creates a shallow copy of `lastOp.attributes` and adds a new property `insert` with the value of `newOp.insert`.
