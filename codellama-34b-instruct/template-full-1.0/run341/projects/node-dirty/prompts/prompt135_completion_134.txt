  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(key, val) => { return { key:val }}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object with only one key-value pair instead of a JSON string with multiple key-value pairs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(key, val) => { return key:val }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object with only one key-value pair instead of a JSON string with multiple key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(key, val) => { return { [key]: val } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object with only one key-value pair and the key is a computed property.

DONE.
