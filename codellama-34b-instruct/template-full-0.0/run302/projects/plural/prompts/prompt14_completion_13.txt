  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` is used to extract the first character of the word, while `1` would extract the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` is used to extract the first character of the word, while `-1` would extract the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` is used to extract the first character of the word, while `word.length - 1` would extract the last character.

DONE.
