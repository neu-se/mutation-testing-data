  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the opposite of the original code fragment, which would cause the `isNaN` method to return `true` for non-NaN values and `false` for NaN values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is finite, which would cause the `isNaN` method to return `false` for non-NaN values and `true` for NaN values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is infinite, which would cause the `isNaN` method to return `false` for non-NaN values and `true` for NaN values.

DONE.
