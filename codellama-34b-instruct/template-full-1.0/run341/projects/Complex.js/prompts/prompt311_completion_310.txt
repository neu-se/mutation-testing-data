  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function is the inverse of the `cos` function, and it returns the arccosine of the argument, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asin` function is the inverse of the `sin` function, and it returns the arcsine of the argument, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function is the inverse of the `tan` function, and it returns the arctangent of the argument, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of the argument.

DONE.
