  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('chilli', 'chillis')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a typo in the word "chillis" and the corrected version is "chillies".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('chilli', 'chillies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a typo in the word "chillis" and the corrected version is "chillies".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('chilli', 'chillies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a typo in the word "chillis" and the corrected version is "chillies".

DONE.
