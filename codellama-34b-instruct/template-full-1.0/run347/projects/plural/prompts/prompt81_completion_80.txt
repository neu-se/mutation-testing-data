  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'babys', 'babies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the added rule would cause the plural form of "baby" to be "babies", instead of "babys".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'kit', 'kits'
```
This would result in different behavior because the added rule would cause the plural form of "kit" to be "kits", instead of "kittes".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bus', 'buseses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the added rule would cause the plural form of "bus" to be "buseses", instead of "buses".

DONE.
