  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the array returned by `split()`, which could potentially cause the code to fail if the first segment of the path is empty or missing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the array returned by `split()`, which could potentially cause the code to fail if the last segment of the path is empty or missing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove both the first and last elements of the array returned by `split()`, which could potentially cause the code to fail if either the first or last segment of the path is empty or missing.

DONE.
