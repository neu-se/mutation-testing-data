  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` and `universalify.fromPromise` have different behavior when it comes to handling errors. While `fromPromise` will return a promise that is rejected with the error, `fromCallback` will call the callback function with the error as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asyncify
```
This would result in different behavior because `asyncify` is a different library that provides similar functionality to `universalify`, but it has a different API and behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Bluebird.promisify
```
This would result in different behavior because `Bluebird.promisify` is a different library that provides similar functionality to `universalify`, but it has a different API and behavior.

DONE.
