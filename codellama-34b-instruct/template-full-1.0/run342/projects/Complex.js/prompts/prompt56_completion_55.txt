  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `a['arg']` to access the `arg` property of object `a`, while this replacement uses `b` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sin(Math.PI / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.atan2(b, a)` to compute the arctangent of `b` and `a`, while this replacement uses `Math.sin(Math.PI / 2)` to compute the sine of the angle between `b` and `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.atan2(b, a)` to compute the arctangent of `b` and `a`, while this replacement uses `Math.atan(b / a)` to compute the arct
