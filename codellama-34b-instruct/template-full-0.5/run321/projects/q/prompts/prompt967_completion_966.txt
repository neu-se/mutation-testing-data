  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be reversed before being passed to `Q.nbind`, which could cause the function to be bound with the arguments in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(["extra argument"])
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument would be added to the `args` array before being passed to `Q.nbind`, which could cause the function to be bound with an incorrect number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be passed to `Q.nbind`, which could cause the function to be bound with no arguments at all.

DONE.
