  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method on arrays, while `array_slice` is not a native JavaScript function or method. Using `[]` would create a new empty array, and calling `slice` on it would return an empty array, while `array_slice` would likely throw an error if it is not defined anywhere in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype` is a property on the `Array` constructor function, while `array_slice` is a variable that may or may not be defined in the code. Using `Array.prototype` would likely throw an error if it is not defined anywhere in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is returned when a variable or property is not defined. Using `undefined` would likely throw an error
