  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function () {
    var foo = yield getFooPromise();
    var bar = yield getBarPromise();
    Q.return(foo + bar);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.return` statement would be executed immediately, instead of being yielded like the other statements. This would cause the generator to return a value immediately, instead of waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function () {
    var foo = yield getFooPromise();
    var bar = yield getBarPromise();
    return foo + bar;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would be executed immediately, instead of being yielded like the other statements. This would cause the generator to return a value immediately, instead of waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.
