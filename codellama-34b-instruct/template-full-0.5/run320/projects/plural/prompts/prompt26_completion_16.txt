  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `substr` method to extract a substring from the input word, starting from index 0 and ending at the second-to-last character. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with 1 would cause the `substr` method to start from index 1 instead, which would result in a different substring being extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `substr` method to extract a substring from the input word, starting from index 0 and ending at the second-to-last character. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with -1 would cause the `substr` method to start from the last character instead, which would result in a different substring being extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `substr
