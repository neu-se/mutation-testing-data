  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument of the `promiseDispatch` function to the `resolvedPromise`, instead of passing all the arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the second and subsequent arguments of the `promiseDispatch` function to the `resolvedPromise`, instead of passing all the arguments as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments of the `promiseDispatch` function to the `resolvedPromise` in reverse order, which could cause unexpected behavior if the function relies on the order of the arguments.

DONE.
