 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options` is an instance of the built-in `String` object, rather than checking if it's a string primitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options === 'object' && 'string' === typeof options.encoding
