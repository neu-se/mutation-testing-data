  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (!loop) {
  loop = false;
  sync = true;
  read(end, function(end, data) {
    if (!end && !test(data))
      return sync ? loop = true : next(end, cb);
    cb(end, data);
  });
  sync = false;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `while` loop condition is now negated, causing the loop to continue even when `loop` is set to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (!test(data)) {
  loop = false;
  sync = true;
  read(end, function(end, data) {
    if (!end && !test(data))
      return sync ? loop = true : next(end, cb);
    cb(end, data);
  });
  sync = false;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition is now based on the result of the `
