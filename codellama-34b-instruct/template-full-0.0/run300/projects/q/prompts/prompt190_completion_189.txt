  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first capture group instead of the second, which would cause the line number to be incorrect in the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the third capture group instead of the second, which would cause the line number to be incorrect in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the fourth capture group instead of the second, which would cause the line number to be incorrect in the stack trace.

DONE.
