read(true, cb)
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `true` as the first argument, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function(err) {
  cb(err || abort)
})
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, and a new function as the second argument. The new function will call the `cb` function with `err` or `abort` as the first argument, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    cb(err)
  } else {
    cb(null, data)
  }
})
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `null` as the
