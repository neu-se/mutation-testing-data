 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises, Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument of `array_map` from the `Q` library to a JavaScript built-in `Array` object, which would not have the same methods as the `Q` library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises, Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is used to handle both promises and immediate values, and using it instead of the `Q` library would cause the function to behave differently for immediate values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises, Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is used to wait for multiple promises to resolve, but here it is being used as if it were a method of the `Q` library, which would cause an error.

DONE.
