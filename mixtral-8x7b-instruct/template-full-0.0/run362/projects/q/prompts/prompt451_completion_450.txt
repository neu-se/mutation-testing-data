 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.push(reason.stack)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only pushes the stack property of the reason object, discarding the "(no stack) " string and the reason value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.unshift("(no stack) " + reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts the reason value with the "(no stack) " prefix at the beginning of the unhandledReasons array, instead of appending it to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons[unhandledReasons.length] = reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns the reason value to the last element of the unhandledReasons array, bypassing the check for the presence of a stack property.

DONE.
