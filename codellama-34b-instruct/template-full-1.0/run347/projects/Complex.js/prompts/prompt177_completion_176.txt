  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c*c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.sqrt()` function to always return `NaN`, regardless of the input values, because `c*c` is always positive and `NaN` is not a valid input for `Math.sqrt()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.sqrt()` function to always return `NaN`, regardless of the input values, because `-c` is always negative and `NaN` is not a valid input for `Math.sqrt()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.sqrt()` function to always return `NaN`, regardless of the input values, because `1/c` is always less than 1 and `NaN` is not a valid input for `Math.sqrt()`.

DONE.
