  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the property of the object with the given key, whereas the original code fragment was just checking if the key exists in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key in object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the key is a property of the object, whereas the original code fragment was checking if the key exists in the object and returning a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has the specified property, whereas the original code fragment was checking if the key exists in the object and returning a boolean value.

DONE.
