  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if there were more than 2 arguments, while this replacement would check if there were more than 1 argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length >= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if there were more than 2 arguments, while this replacement would check if there were at least 2 arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.lenth % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if there were an odd number of arguments, while this replacement would check if there were an even number of arguments.

DONE.
