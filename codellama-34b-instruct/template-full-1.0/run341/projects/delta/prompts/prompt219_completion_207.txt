  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only mutates the code if the two delta operations are the same, whereas this modified code fragment mutates the code if the two delta operations are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment compares the `ops` property of `this` to the `ops` property of `other`, whereas this modified code fragment compares `this` to `other` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!other
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only mutates the code if `other` is truthy, whereas this modified code fragment mutates the code if `other` is falsy.

DONE.
