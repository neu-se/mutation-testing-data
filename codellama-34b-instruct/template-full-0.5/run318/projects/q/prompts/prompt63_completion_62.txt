  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` would be called with `null` as the context, rather than `window`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` would be called with `undefined` as the context, rather than `window`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` would be called with an empty object as the context, rather than `window`.

DONE.
