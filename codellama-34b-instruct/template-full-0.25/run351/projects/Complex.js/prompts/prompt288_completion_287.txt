  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator changes the sign of the value, which affects the calculation of the complex exponential.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the value changes the calculation of the complex exponential.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying by 2 changes the calculation of the complex exponential.

DONE.
