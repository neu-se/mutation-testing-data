  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` would create a new deferred object, whereas `Q` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` would create a new promise that resolves when the given promise is resolved, whereas `Q` would simply return the given promise.

DONE.
