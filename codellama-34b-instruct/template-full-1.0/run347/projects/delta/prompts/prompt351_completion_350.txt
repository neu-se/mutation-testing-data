  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a property of the `Op` object, while `attributes` is an optional parameter that may not be present in every `Op`. Accessing the `insert` property would potentially cause a null pointer exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp` is a different `Op` object than `baseOp`, and it may not have the same properties or attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `attributes` parameter of the `retain` method. The method would throw a type error when called with `null`.

DONE.
