  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat two objects with the same properties and values as unequal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.is(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat two objects with the same properties and values as equal, even if they are not the same object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(newOp.attributes instanceof Object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat a non-object value as equal to an object value, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
