  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < tokens.length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop one iteration earlier, potentially causing the parser to miss a token.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start one iteration later, potentially causing the parser to skip over a token.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i % 2 == 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over even-indexed tokens, potentially causing the parser to miss every other token.

DONE.
