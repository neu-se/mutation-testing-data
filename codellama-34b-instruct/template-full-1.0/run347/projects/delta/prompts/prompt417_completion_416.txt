  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` expects a single argument, which is the number of elements to advance, but `2` is being passed, which would cause the iterator to advance by 2 elements, rather than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` returns the index of the next element, but adding 1 to that index would cause the iterator to point to the next element after the next element, rather than the next element itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next element, but adding 1 to that length would cause the iterator to advance by one more element than the original code, which could potentially cause the iterator to skip over an important element.
