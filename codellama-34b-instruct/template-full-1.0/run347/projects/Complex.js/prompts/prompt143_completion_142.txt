  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if a value is Not-a-Number, while the `isZero` method checks if a value is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method checks if a value is infinite, while the `isZero` method checks if a value is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isPositive']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPositive` method checks if a value is positive, while the `isZero` method checks if a value is zero.

DONE.
