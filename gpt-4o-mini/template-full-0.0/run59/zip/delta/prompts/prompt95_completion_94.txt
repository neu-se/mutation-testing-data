Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of removing an element from the array and inserting the new operation at a specific index, it would simply append the new operation to the end of the `ops` array, potentially leading to incorrect operation sequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 1, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the element at the specified index with `newOp`, rather than inserting `newOp` at the index and shifting subsequent elements, which could lead to loss of operations that were supposed to be retained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert `newOp` twice at the specified index instead of once, which could lead to duplicate operations being added to the `ops` array, altering the intended operation sequence.

DONE.
