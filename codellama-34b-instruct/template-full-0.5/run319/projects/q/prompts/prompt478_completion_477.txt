  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the array would be increased by 2 instead of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the array would be decreased by 0 instead of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the array would be decreased by 1 instead of 0.

DONE.
