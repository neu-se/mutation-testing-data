  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `then` method on the `promise` object, which would execute the `onFulfilled` callback if the promise is fulfilled, the `onRejected` callback if the promise is rejected, and the `onProgress` callback if the promise is still pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected).catch(onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `then` method on the `promise` object, which would execute the `onFulfilled` callback if the promise is fulfilled, the `onRejected` callback if the promise is rejected, and the `catch` method would catch any errors and execute the `onProgress` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then
