  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejected promise would be resolved with the fulfillment value, rather than being rejected with the rejection reason as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(_rejected(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfillment value would be the result of calling `_rejected(value)`, rather than the original `value` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(_fulfilled(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfillment value would be the result of calling `_fulfilled(value)`, rather than the original `value` itself.

DONE.
