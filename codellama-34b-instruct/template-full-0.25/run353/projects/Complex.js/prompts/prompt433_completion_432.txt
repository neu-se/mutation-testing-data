  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ceil` method to always return the real part of the complex number, instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ceil` method to always return a value that is one greater than the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places + this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ceil` method to always return a value that is the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, instead of just the imaginary part.

DONE.
