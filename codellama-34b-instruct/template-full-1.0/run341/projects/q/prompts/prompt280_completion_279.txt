  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` is a different function that is used to reduce an array to a single value, whereas `array_slice` is used to extract a subset of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` is a different function that is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array, whereas `array_slice` is used to extract a subset of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` is a different function that is used to create a new array by filtering out elements of an existing array that do not satisfy a certain condition, whereas `array_slice` is used to extract a subset of an array.

DONE.
