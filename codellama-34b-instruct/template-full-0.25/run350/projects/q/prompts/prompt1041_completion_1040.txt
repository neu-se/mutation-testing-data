  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(next.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the `next` promise with the `head` property of the `ends` promise, while this new code fragment resolves the `next` promise with the `ends` promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(ends.promise.get("head"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the `next` promise with the `head` property of the `ends` promise, while this new code fragment resolves the `next` promise with the `head` property of the `ends.promise` promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(ends.promise.get("tail"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the `next` promise with the `head` property of the `ends` promise, while this new code fragment resol
