  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `Math.random()` would introduce randomness in the calculation, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `1` would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `2` would double the result of the calculation.

DONE.
