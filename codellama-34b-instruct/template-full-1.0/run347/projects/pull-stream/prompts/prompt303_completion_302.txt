  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is a boolean, and by negating it, the resulting value would always be opposite to the original value, potentially causing the function to skip or repeat certain actions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is a boolean, and by adding 1 to it, the resulting value would always be a number, potentially causing the function to interpret the result as a signal to stop reading or to continue reading indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is a boolean, and by incrementing it, the resulting value would always be a number, potentially causing the function to interpret the result as a signal to stop reading or to continue reading indefinitely.

DONE.
