Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `policy.query` method to be called with `undefined` as the context, potentially leading to incorrect results if the method relies on the context for its logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `policy.query` method always evaluate the context as `true`, which could bypass any checks that depend on the actual context value, leading to incorrect permission evaluations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `path` variable instead of the `ctx`, which could lead to the `policy.query` method interpreting the path as the context, potentially resulting in incorrect access control decisions.

DONE.
