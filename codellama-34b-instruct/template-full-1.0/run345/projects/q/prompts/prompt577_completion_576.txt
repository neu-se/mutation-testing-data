  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"previous"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick(callback)` would be replaced with `Q.previousTick(callback)`, which would schedule the execution of the callback function on the previous tick instead of the next tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"random"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick(callback)` would be replaced with `Q.randomTick(callback)`, which would schedule the execution of the callback function on a random tick.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"start"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick(callback)` would be replaced with `Q.startTick(callback)`, which would start a new tick and schedule the execution of the callback function in that tick.

DONE.
