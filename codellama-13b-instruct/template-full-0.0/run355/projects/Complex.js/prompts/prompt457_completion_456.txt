  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method returns `true` if the complex number is not a number, whereas the original code fragment returns `true` if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method returns `true` if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, whereas the original code fragment returns `true` if the complex number is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method returns `true` if the complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, whereas the original code fragment returns `true` if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

DONE.
