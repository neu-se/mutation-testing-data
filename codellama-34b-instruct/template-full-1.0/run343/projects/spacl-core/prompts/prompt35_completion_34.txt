  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire path without reversing the segments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the entire path without slicing off the first segment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the reversed segments with '/' instead of using them as an array.

DONE.
