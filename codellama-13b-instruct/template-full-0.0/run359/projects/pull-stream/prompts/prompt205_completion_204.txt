  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is not defined in the original code, and therefore the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not the same as the `end` variable, and therefore the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not the same as the `end` variable, and therefore the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
