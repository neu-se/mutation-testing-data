  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(at .+ \((.+):(\d+):)(\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would capture the entire line number instead of just the column number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\) +\w+/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match any word character at the end of the line, instead of just the parentheses.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(\d+)\)/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would not capture the column number.

DONE.
