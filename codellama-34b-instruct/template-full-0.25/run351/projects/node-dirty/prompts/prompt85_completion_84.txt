  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `'\n'` as the separator, while this code uses the default separator, which is `','`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('\t')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `'\n'` as the separator, while this code uses `'\t'` as the separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `'\n'` as the separator, while this code uses an empty string as the separator, which would split the buffer into individual characters.

DONE.
