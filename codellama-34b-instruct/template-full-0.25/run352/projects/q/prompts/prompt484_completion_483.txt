  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(0, unhandledReasons.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `unhandledReasons` array in place, removing all elements from it, whereas the original code fragment would return a shallow copy of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `unhandledReasons` array, whereas the original code fragment would return a shallow copy of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `unhandledReasons` array, whereas the original code fragment would return a shallow copy of the array.

DONE.
