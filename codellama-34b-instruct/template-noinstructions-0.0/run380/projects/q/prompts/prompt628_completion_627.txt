  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the `set` method to assign the wrong value to the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` argument is added to the end of the argument list, which could cause the `set` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` argument is duplicated, which could cause the `set` method to assign the wrong value to the property.

DONE.
