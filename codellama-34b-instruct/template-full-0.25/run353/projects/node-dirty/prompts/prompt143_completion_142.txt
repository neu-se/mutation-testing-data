  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a new error object instead of the original error object, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this new error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a null error object instead of the original error object, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this null error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an undefined error object instead of the original error object, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this undefined error.

DONE.
