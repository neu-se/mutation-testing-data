  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is singular and the replaced code fragment is plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment because the replaced code fragment is also singular.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is singular and the replaced code fragment is plural.

DONE.
