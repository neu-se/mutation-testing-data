  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.apply(undefined, arguments);
```
This would result in an error because `undefined` is not a function, and `call.apply` expects the first argument to be a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and `call.apply` expects the first argument to be a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is not a function, and `call.apply` expects the first argument to be a function.

DONE.
