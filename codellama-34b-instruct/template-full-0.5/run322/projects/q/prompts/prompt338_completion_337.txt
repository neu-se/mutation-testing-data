  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with no arguments, whereas the original code called it with `promise` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with `promise` as the `this` value, whereas the original code called it with no `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.call(promise, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with `promise` as both the `this` value and the first argument, whereas the original code called it with no `this` value and `promise` as the first argument.

DONE.
