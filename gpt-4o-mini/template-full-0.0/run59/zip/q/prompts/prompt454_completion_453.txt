Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stack not available: " + reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the message format and does not indicate that there is no stack trace, potentially leading to confusion about the nature of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error: " + reason.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the reason to a string representation, which may not include stack information and could mislead users about the error's context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unknown error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it completely omits any reference to the actual reason for the rejection, making it impossible to diagnose the issue based on the error message.

DONE.
