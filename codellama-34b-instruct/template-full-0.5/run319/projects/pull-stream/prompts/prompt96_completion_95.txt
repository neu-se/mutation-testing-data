  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments, and it would also cause the `err` variable to be set to `true`, which would change the behavior of the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments, and it would also cause the `err` variable to be set to `false`, which would change the behavior of the `if` statement.

DONE.
