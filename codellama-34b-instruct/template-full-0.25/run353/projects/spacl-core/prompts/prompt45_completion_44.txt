  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the part matches the pattern `:.+`, which means it contains a colon followed by one or more characters. The modified code fragment checks if the part does not match the pattern `:.+`, which means it does not contain a colon followed by one or more characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the part matches the pattern `:.+`, which means it contains a colon followed by one or more characters. The modified code fragment checks if the part does not match the pattern `:.+`, which means it does not contain a colon followed by one or more characters. However, the modified code fragment also checks if the part is not undefined, which is not the case in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:
