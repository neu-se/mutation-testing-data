  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.foreach` iterates over the elements of an array and applies a function to each of them, whereas `ref.unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice` extracts a portion of an array and returns a new array, whereas `ref.unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.splice` adds or removes elements from an array, whereas `ref.unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

DONE.
