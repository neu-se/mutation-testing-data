 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `sin(point1Rad)` calculation with the number 1, which would not change based on the input value of `point1Rad`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `sin(point1Rad)` calculation with the constant value of `Math.sin(0)`, which is 0, regardless of the input value of `point1Rad`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `sin(point1Rad)` calculation with the constant value of `Math.sin(Math.PI)`, which is 0, regardless of the input value of `point1Rad`.

DONE.
