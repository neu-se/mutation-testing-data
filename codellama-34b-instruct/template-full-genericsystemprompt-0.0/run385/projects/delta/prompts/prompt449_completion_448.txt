  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this replacement checks if it is not a number. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `op.delete` is a number, and `true` when it is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this replacement checks if it is `undefined`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `op.delete` is a number, and `true` when it is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this replacement checks if it is `
