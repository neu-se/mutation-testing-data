  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, which means that the code would behave differently if `ended` was `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND operator, which means that the code would only execute the second part of the expression if the first part is `true`. In this case, the first part is `ended`, which means that if `ended` is `false`, the second part will not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR operator, which means that the code would execute the second part of the expression if the first part is `true` or if the second part is `true`. In this case, the first part is
