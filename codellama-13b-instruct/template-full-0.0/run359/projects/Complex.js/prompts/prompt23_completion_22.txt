  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, causing the code to execute the `else` block instead of the `if` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be satisfied only when `a` and `b` are equal, causing the code to execute the `else` block instead of the `if` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be satisfied only when `a` is negative, causing the code to execute the `else` block instead of the `if` block.

DONE.
