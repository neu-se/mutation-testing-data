  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is used to retrieve a property's value, while "set" is used to set a property's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is used to delete a property, while "get" is used to retrieve its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because "undefined" is not a valid property name, and would raise a TypeError when attempting to retrieve its value.

DONE.
