  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `2`, which would cause the function to return a slice of the original array starting from the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `3`, which would cause the function to return a slice of the original array starting from the third element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `4`, which would cause the function to return a slice of the original array starting from the fourth element.

DONE.
