Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.removeTrailingSlash && urlObj.pathname !== '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditional logic to only remove the trailing slash when `removeTrailingSlash` is true and the pathname is not the root directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.pathname === '/' && urlObj.hash === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the dependency on `removeTrailingSlash` and only removes the trailing slash when the pathname is the root directory and there is no hash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!options.removeTrailingSlash || urlObj.hash !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the logic of `removeTrailingSlash` and also removes the trailing slash when there is a hash present, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
