  Option 1: the PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the `subdomain` property of `currentUrl`, which may not exist or have a different value than expected.

Option 2: the PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the `domain` property of `currentUrl`, which may not exist or have a different value than expected.

Option 3: the PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the `path` property of `currentUrl`, which may not exist or have a different value than expected.

DONE.
