  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-c
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function returns the absolute value of a number, while the `-c` operator negates the value of the variable `c`. This could cause incorrect calculations and yield different results in the final output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(c, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function returns the value of a number raised to a power, while the `c` variable is a number. This could cause incorrect calculations and yield different results in the final output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * c
```
This would result in different behavior because the `2 * c` expression multiplies the value of the variable `c` by 2, while the `Math.abs` function returns the absolute value of a number. This could cause incorrect calculations and yield different results in the final output.

DONE.
