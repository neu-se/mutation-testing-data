  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to return a rejected promise with the `exception` object, rather than a resolved promise with the `result` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to return a resolved promise with the `exception` object, rather than a rejected promise with the `result` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

DONE.
