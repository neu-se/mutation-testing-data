  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!loop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `loop`, causing the loop to run indefinitely even when `end` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the loop when `end` is true, causing the loop to terminate prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop || end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the loop when `end` is true, causing the loop to terminate prematurely.

DONE.
