  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are added to the `hasNext` method call, which would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` if the `otherIter` object does not have a `hasNext` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method is not called, which would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` if the `otherIter` object does not have a `hasNext` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are added to the `hasNext` method call, which would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` if the `otherIter` object does not have a `hasNext` method.

DONE.
