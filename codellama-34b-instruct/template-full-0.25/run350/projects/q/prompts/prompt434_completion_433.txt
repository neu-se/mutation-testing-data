  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, causing the `trackRejection` function to be called, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, causing the `untrackRejection` function to be called, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` in a browser environment, causing the `process.emit` function to be skipped, even if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
