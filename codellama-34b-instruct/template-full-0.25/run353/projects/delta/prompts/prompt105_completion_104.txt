  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => {
  if (op.retain) {
    op.retain += 1;
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `retain` property of each op in the `ops` array, which would cause the `length` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => {
  if (op.retain) {
    op.retain = 0;
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `retain` property of each op in the `ops` array to 0, which would cause the `length` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => {
  if (op.retain) {
    op.retain = -1;
  }
});
