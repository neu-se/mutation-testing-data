  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] === value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator checks if a property is defined in an object, while the `===` operator checks for the specific value of a property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete this[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator removes a property from an object, while the `in` operator checks if a property is defined in an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator checks if a property is defined in an object, while the `!==` operator checks for the specific value of a property.

DONE.
