  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array. In the context of the code, `push` would cause the new operation to be added to the end of the `ops` array, which may not be the desired behavior.
