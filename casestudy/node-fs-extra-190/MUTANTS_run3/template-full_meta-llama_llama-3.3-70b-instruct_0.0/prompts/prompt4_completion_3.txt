Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!clobber
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the logic of the `clobber` option, causing the function to throw an error when `clobber` is true and delete the file when `clobber` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
clobber === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `clobber` is explicitly false, rather than just a falsy value, which could lead to different outcomes depending on the type and value of `clobber`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof clobber === 'boolean'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `clobber` is a boolean value, rather than its actual value, which means that non-boolean values would cause the function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
