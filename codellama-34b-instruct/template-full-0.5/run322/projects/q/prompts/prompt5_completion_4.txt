  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", definition + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add an additional argument to the `definition` function, which could cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", definition - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would subtract an additional argument from the `definition` function, which could cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", definition * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would multiply the `definition` function by 2, which could cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
