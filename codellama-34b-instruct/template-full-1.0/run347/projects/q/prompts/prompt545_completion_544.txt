```
result = <PLACEHOLDER>(arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to call the argument as a function, which would likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = generator[verb]();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `generator[verb]` method without any arguments, which could result in different behavior if the method has side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = generator[verb](arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `generator[verb]` method with the `arg` argument, which could result in different behavior if the method has side effects.

DONE.
