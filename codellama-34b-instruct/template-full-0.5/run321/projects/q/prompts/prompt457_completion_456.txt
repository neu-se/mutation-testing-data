  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than checking if the array contains a specific element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the index of the `promise` element in the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than checking if the array contains the element.

DONE.
