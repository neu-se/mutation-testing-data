 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 **
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function is used to calculate the power of a number, while the binary bitwise operator `**` is used to calculate the exponentiation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(Math.log(2) * zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function is used to calculate the power of a number, while the above code uses the `Math.exp` and `Math.log` function to calculate the power of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom) * 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the above code is multiplying the result of `Math.pow` by 0.5, which would change the final result.

DONE.
