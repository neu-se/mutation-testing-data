  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise["get"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `["get"]` indexing operator is not the same as the `.` property accessor. While they both return the value of the property, they behave differently in certain situations, such as when the property is a function or an object with a custom `valueOf` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.returns
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `returns` method on the `promise` object, which is not a valid method for a promise object. This would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise["then"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not the same as the `get` method, and it would cause a different set of callbacks to be invoked.

DONE.
