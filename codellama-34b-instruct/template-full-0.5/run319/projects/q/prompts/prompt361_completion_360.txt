  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which would trigger the rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved or rejected, which would trigger the progress handler instead of the fulfillment or rejection handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would create a new rejected promise instead of resolving the current one, which would trigger the rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler.

DONE.
