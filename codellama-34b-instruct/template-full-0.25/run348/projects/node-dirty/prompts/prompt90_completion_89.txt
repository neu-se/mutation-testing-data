  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error only if the line is empty, while the new code fragment emits an error for any line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Invalid row: ' + rowStr));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error only if the row is invalid, while the new code fragment emits an error for any row that is not valid JSON.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Corrupted row: ' + rowStr));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error only if the row is corrupted, while the new code fragment emits an error for any row that cannot be parsed as JSON.

DONE.
