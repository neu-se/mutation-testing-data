  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `pageurl_path` string into an array of individual characters, rather than splitting it into an array of substrings based on the `/` character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split(/\//g)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `pageurl_path` string into an array of substrings based on the `/` character, but it would also remove any empty strings from the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split(/[/]/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `pageurl_path` string into an array of substrings based on the `/` character, but it would also remove any empty strings from the resulting array, and it would also remove any `/` characters from the resulting array.

DONE.
