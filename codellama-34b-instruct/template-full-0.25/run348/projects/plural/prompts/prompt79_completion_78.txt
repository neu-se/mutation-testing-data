  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the exact word "goose" while the new code fragment is checking for the word "goos" which is a different word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the exact word "goose" while the new code fragment is checking for the word "goose" followed by the letter "s" which is a different word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the exact word "goose" while the new code fragment is checking for the word "geese" which is a different word.

DONE.
