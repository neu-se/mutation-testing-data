  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` is a function that takes two arguments, but `end` and `data` are not the correct arguments. The function would still work, but it would not be testing the correct values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` is a function that takes two arguments, but `end` and `data` are not the correct arguments. The function would still work, but it would not be testing the correct values.
