  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the type of `lastOp` and in this case, it will always return `true` regardless of the type of `lastOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp` is an object, but in this case, it is checking if `lastOp` has a length property and its value is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp` is an object, but in this case, it is checking if `lastOp` is an instance of the `Array` constructor and also checking if it has a length property and its value is greater than 0.

DONE.
