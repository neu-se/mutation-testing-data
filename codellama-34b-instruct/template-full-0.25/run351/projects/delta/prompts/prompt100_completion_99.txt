  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'string' && !lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is checking if `lastOp.retain` is a string, whereas the original code fragment is checking if it is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is checking if `lastOp.retain` is a number, whereas the original code fragment is checking if it is a string. Additionally, the `!` operator is removed, so the code will execute the `if` block if `lastOp.attributes` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment will execute the `if` block if `lastOp.attributes` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && last
