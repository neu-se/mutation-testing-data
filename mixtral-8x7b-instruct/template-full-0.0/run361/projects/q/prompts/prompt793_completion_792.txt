 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).spread
```
This would result in different behavior because `.spread` expects an array as input, while `.then` accepts any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `.all` waits for all input promises to be fulfilled before resolving, while `.then` resolves as soon as one of the input promises resolves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).race
```
This would result in different behavior because `.race` resolves as soon as any of the input promises resolves, while `.then` resolves as soon as one of the input promises resolves, but without affecting the resolution of the other promises.

DONE.
