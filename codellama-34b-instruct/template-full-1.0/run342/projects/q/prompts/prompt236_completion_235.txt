  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise, args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a single argument, but `resolvedPromise` expects two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a thenable object, and `resolvedPromise` expects a thenable object.

DONE.
