  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.sort();
```
This would result in different behavior because it sorts the `rules` array before iterating over it, which could potentially change the order in which the rules are applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the first rule in the `rules` array, which could potentially change the outcome of the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.map((r) => r.clone());
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `Rule` objects in the `rules` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `clone` method.

DONE.
