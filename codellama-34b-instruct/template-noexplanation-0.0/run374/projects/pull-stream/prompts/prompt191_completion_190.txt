  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This code fragment is a property access expression that accesses the `foo` property of the `prop` object. It is a different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `prop`, which is a reference to the `prop` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This code fragment is an arithmetic expression that adds 1 to the `prop` object. It is a different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `prop`, which is a reference to the `prop` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.bar
```
This code fragment is a property access expression that accesses the `bar` property of the `prop` object. It is a different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `prop`, which is a reference to the `prop` object itself.

DONE.
