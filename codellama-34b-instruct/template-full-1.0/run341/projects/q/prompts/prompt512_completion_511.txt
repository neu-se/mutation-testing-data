  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```object['keys']()```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `keys` method on `object`, while the replaced code fragment calls the `keys` method on the `object_keys` variable, which is not defined in the context of the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```object['toString']()```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `toJSON` method on `object`, while the replaced code fragment calls the `toString` method on `object`, which is not the same method and might not produce the same result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```object['valueOf']()```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `toJSON` method on `object`, while the replaced code fragment calls the `valueOf` method on `object`, which is not the same method and might not produce the same result.

DONE.
