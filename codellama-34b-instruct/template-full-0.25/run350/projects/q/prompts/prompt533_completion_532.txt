  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not defined in the code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError` and the promise would be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a function, so it would cause a `TypeError` and the promise would be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function, so it would cause a `TypeError` and the promise would be rejected.

DONE.
