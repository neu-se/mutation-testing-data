  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the strict equality operator (`===`), which checks for both value and type equality, while the replacement code fragment uses the non-strict equality operator (`!==`), which checks for value equality but not type equality. This could cause the `forEach` method to behave differently when iterating over objects with methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fn(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the strict equality operator (`===`), which checks for both value and type equality, while the replacement code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (`!`) to negate the result of the `fn` function. This could cause the `forEach` method to behave differently when iterating over objects with methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(val, key) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
