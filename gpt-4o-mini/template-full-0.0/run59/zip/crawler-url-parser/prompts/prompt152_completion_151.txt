Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for a difference of 2 in the part count, which would never be true for URLs that are at the same level, thus altering the logic for determining URL relationships.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for any non-zero difference in part count, which would incorrectly classify URLs that are at the same level as different levels.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for a part count difference of -1, which would only classify URLs as "uplevel" when they are one level deeper, potentially missing other valid classifications.

DONE.
