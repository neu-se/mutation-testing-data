  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the absolute value of `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while this replacement only checks if `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`. This means that if `b` is negative, the original code would return `false`, while this replacement would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the absolute value of `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while this replacement checks if the absolute value of `b` is less than or equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`. This means that if `b` is equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`, the original code would return `false`, while this replacement would return `true`.

Option 3:
