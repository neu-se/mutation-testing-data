  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['abs']` is the absolute value of `a`, while `a['arg']` is the argument (angle) of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['re']` is the real part of `a`, while `a['arg']` is the argument (angle) of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['im']` is the imaginary part of `a`, while `a['arg']` is the argument (angle) of `a`.

DONE.
