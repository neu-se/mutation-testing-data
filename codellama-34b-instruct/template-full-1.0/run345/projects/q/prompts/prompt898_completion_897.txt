  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end. As a result, the `makeNodeResolver()` method would be called earlier or later than expected, potentially causing the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift().push()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of the array, and then `push()` adds an element to the end of the array. As a result, the `makeNodeResolver()` method would be called on a different element of the array, potentially causing the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.reverse().unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, and then `unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of the array. As
