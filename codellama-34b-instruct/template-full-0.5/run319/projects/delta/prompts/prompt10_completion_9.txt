  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which inverts the truthiness of the expression. In this case, it would invert the truthiness of `a`, which would result in the opposite behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `a`, which would change the result of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `a` by 2, which would change the result of the expression.

DONE.
