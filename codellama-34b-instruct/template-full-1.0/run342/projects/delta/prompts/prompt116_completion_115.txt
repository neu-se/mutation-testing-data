  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(null, initialValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code fragment, the predicate function is only called with non-null values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(undefined, initialValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code fragment, the predicate function is only called with defined values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(false, initialValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code fragment, the predicate function is only called with truthy values.

DONE.
