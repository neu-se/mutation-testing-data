  Here are three different options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would consider negative indices as valid, while the original code fragment did not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would consider any non-zero index as valid, while the original code fragment only considered indices greater than or equal to zero as valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.ptr > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would consider the pointer to be greater than zero as valid, while the original code fragment did not.

DONE.
