  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is used for specifying the URL of an image or other media, whereas the `href` attribute is used for specifying the URL of a link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data-href'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data-href` attribute is used for specifying the URL of a link, but it is not a standard attribute and may not be recognized by all web browsers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' + '?query=string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` attribute is used for specifying the URL of a link, but the `?query=string` part would cause the link to be treated as a search query rather than a direct link to a URL.

DONE.
