Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
micromatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `micromatch` is an object with various methods, including `makeRe` and other glob pattern matching functions, whereas the original code used `isGlob` which checks if a string is a glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `pattern.includes` checks if a string includes a certain substring, whereas the original code used `isGlob` which checks if an entire string is a glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => true
```
This would result in different behavior because this replacement always returns `true`, indicating that every pattern is dynamic, whereas the original code used `isGlob` to check if a pattern is actually a glob.

DONE.
