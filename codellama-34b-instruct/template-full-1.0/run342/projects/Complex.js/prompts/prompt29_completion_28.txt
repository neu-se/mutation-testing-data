  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are different variables.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` is not the same as `a`.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because `-a` is not the same as `a`.

DONE.
