  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` is the latitude of the first point, while `φ2` is the latitude of the second point. Using `φ1` instead of `φ2` would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` is the longitude of the first point, while `λ2` is the longitude of the second point. Using `λ1` instead of `λ2` would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
π
```
This would result in different behavior because `π` is a mathematical constant, while `φ2` is a variable representing the latitude of the second point. Using `π` instead of `φ2` would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
