  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `test` function returns a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with an argument `data`, which may not be the same as the argument `e` that the function was originally defined to accept.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with two arguments `data`, which may not be the same as the argument `e` that the function was originally defined to accept.

DONE.
