  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a').attr('href');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `a` element that is a descendant of the current element, rather than the current element itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).siblings('a').attr('href');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `a` element that is a sibling of the current element, rather than the current element itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'http://example.com');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `href` attribute of the current element to `http://example.com`, rather than extracting the `href` attribute from the current element.

DONE.
