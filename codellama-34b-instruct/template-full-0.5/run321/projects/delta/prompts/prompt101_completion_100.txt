  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of an array, whereas `pop()` removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` removes a specified number of elements from an array, starting from a given index. In this case, it would remove the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, without modifying the original array. In this case, it would return a new array containing only the first element.

DONE.
