  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
OtherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic and only execute the block if the next operation is not an insert.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
OtherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the block only if the next operation is a delete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
OtherIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the block if the next operation is not a delete.
