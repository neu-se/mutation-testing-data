  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of "memo" as "memos", while the modified code fragment returns the singular form of "memo" as "memo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of "memo" as "memos", while the modified code fragment returns the plural form of "memo" as "memos".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of "memo" as "memos", while the modified code fragment returns the plural form of "memo" as "memoes".

DONE.
