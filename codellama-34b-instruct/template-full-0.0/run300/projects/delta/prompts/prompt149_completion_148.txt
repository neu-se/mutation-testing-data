  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `>` operator, which checks for strict inequality, while the replacement code fragment uses the `>=` operator, which checks for non-strict inequality. This means that the replacement code fragment would consider a value of 0 to be equal to the result of the subtraction, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `>` operator, which checks for strict inequality, while the replacement code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for strict equality. This means that the replacement code fragment would consider a value of 0 to be not equal to the result of the subtraction, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft
