  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` and `slice` have different behavior when the start index is negative. While `slice` will return an empty string, `substring` will return the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` and `slice` have different behavior when the start index is negative. While `slice` will return an empty string, `substr` will return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split('').slice(1).join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different method to extract the substring, which can have different performance characteristics.

DONE.
