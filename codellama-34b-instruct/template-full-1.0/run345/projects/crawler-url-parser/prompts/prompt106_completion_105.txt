  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting urlMap to undefined would cause the `typeof urlMap.set` check in the extract function to fail, resulting in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete urlMap.set;
```
This would result in different behavior because deletion of the set method from the urlMap object would cause the `typeof urlMap.set` check in the extract function to fail, resulting in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap = {
	set: function() {
		throw new Error('Invalid set method called');
	}
};
```
This would result in different behavior because adding a custom set method to the urlMap object would cause the `typeof urlMap.set` check in the extract function to fail, resulting in an error.

DONE.
