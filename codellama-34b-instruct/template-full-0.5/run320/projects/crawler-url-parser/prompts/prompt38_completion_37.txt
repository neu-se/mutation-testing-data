  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would not be called with the `parseQueryString` and `slashesDenoteHost` options set to `true`, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would be called with the `baseUrlStr` parameter set to the `baseUrlStr` variable, which could cause the URL to be parsed differently than if the `currentUrlStr` parameter were used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would be called with the `baseUrlStr` parameter set to `null`, which could cause the URL to be parsed differently than if a valid base URL were used.

DONE.
