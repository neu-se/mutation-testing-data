  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set.clear(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Map.prototype.set` sets the value for a key in the map, while `Map.prototype.clear` removes all key-value pairs from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set.set(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Map.prototype.set` sets the value for a key in the map, while `Map.prototype.set.set` sets the value for a key in the map to a new value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Dirty.prototype.set` sets the value for a key in the map, while `this.set` sets the value for a key in the map to a new value.

DONE.
