  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, which would affect the resulting array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the `args` array would be different, which would affect the resulting array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a different value than `arguments`, which would affect the resulting array of arguments.

DONE.
