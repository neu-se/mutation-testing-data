  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.reverse()` would reverse the order of the parts, which would cause the final regex to be constructed in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.slice(1)` would remove the first part of the path, which would cause the final regex to be constructed with a different set of parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.join('')` would concatenate the parts of the path into a single string, which would cause the final regex to be constructed with a different set of parts.

DONE.
