  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ foo: 'bar' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` object is no longer passed as an argument to `array_map`, and the `thisp` argument of the callback function may not be bound to the correct object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello world'
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function in `array_map` is called with a non-object argument, which may cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` object is no longer passed as an argument to `array_map`, and the callback function may not be called with the expected arguments or context.

DONE.
