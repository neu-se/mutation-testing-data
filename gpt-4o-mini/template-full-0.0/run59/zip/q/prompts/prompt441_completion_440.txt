Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs the unhandled rejection to the console instead of emitting an event, which means that the application will not be able to handle the rejection in the same way as it would with `process.emit`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.log("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.log` is not a valid method, leading to a runtime error instead of emitting the "unhandledRejection" event, which would disrupt the normal flow of error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("rejectionHandled", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a "rejectionHandled" event instead of "unhandledRejection", which would incorrectly signal that the rejection has been handled when it has not, potentially leading to confusion in the application's error handling logic.

DONE.
