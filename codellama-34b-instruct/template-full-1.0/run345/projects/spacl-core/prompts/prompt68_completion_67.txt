  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was iterating over the `rules` array using a `for...of` loop, while this modified code is using a traditional `for` loop with index `i`. The `for...of` loop would yield the elements of the array one by one, while the `for` loop with index `i` would iterate over the array indices. Depending on the context in which the code is used, this could result in different behavior.
DONE.
