 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the receiver of the `dispatch` method to `Q(null)`, which may not have the expected `dispatch` method implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}['dispatch']
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the receiver of the `dispatch` method to an empty object, which does not have the expected `dispatch` method implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return this; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the receiver of the `dispatch` method to a function that always returns `this`, which may not have the expected `dispatch` method implementation.

DONE.
