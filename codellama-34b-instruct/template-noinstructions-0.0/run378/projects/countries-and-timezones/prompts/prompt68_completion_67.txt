  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `country` is an object with an `id` property, regardless of the value of `country.id`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `country` is an object with an `id` property, regardless of the value of `country.id`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `country` is an object with an `id` property, regardless of the value of `country.id`.

DONE.
