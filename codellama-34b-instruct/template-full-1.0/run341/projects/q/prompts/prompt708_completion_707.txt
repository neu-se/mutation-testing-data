  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a different variable that may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a different object that may have a different set of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_splice(args, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_splice(args, 1)` would return a new array with the first element removed, potentially changing the values that are passed to the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
