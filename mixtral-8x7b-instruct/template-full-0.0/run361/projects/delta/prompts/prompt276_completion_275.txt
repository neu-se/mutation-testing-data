 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the next operation as an insertion of a string, even if it's a delete or retain operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType(thisIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume the next operation from the iterator, instead of just peeking at its type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'unknown'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the next operation as having an unknown type, which could cause the code to skip or misinterpret operations.

DONE.
