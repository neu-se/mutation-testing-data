  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test()` method returns a boolean indicating whether or not a pattern exists in a given string, whereas the `exec()` method returns an array of matches or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.match
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method returns an array of matches or null, whereas the `exec()` method returns an array of matches or null, but also includes additional information such as the index of the match and the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.search
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search()` method returns the index of the first match or -1 if no match is found, whereas the `exec()` method returns an array of matches or null.

DONE.
