  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the "apply" method, which passes the arguments as an array, while the new code uses the "post" method, which passes the arguments as a single value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the "post" method, which passes the arguments as a single value, while the new code uses the "apply" method, which passes the arguments as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
