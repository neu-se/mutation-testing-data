  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that will not have a `then` method, unlike `void 0` which is a primitive value that will be coerced to an object with a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that will not have a `then` method, unlike `void 0` which is a primitive value that will be coerced to an object with a `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a primitive value that will not have a `then` method, unlike `void 0` which is a primitive value that will be coerced to an object with a `then` method.

DONE.
