  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment iterates over the keys of the `verbs` object, while this replacement iterates over the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment iterates over the keys of the `verbs` object, while this replacement iterates over the key-value pairs of the `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment iterates over the keys of the `verbs` object, while this replacement iterates over the keys of the `verbs` object and then uses the `verbs` object to get the corresponding value.

DONE.
