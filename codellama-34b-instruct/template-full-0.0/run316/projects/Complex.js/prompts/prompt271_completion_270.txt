  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the angle in the range of -π/2 to π/2, while adding `Math.PI` would shift the angle to the range of π/2 to 3π/2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the angle in the range of -π/2 to π/2, while multiplying by 2 would shift the angle to the range of -π to π.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the angle in the range of -π/2 to π/2, while dividing
