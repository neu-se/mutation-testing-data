  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number, while `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to the given number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number, while `Math.ceil` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number, while `Math.round` returns the nearest integer.

DONE.
