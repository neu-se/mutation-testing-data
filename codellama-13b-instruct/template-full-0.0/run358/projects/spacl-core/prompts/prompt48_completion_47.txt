  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the value of `part.slice(1)` onto the `props` array, while the modified code fragment pushes the value of `part.slice(1)` onto the `props` array and then returns the `props` array. This would cause the `props` array to be returned instead of the `regex` string, which could cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.
