  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is less than zero, whereas this new code fragment checks if it is greater than zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is less than zero, whereas this new code fragment checks if it is less than or equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, whereas this new code fragment checks if it is not zero.

DONE.
