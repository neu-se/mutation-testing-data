  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected immediately if any of the promises gets rejected, instead of waiting for all promises to be settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be pending if any of the promises is pending, instead of waiting for all promises to be settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "fulfilled" && snapshot.value === 42
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with the value 42 if any of the promises is fulfilled with the value 42, instead of waiting for all promises to be settled.

DONE.
