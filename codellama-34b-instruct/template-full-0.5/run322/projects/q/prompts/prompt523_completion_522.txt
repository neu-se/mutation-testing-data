```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be applied to the wrong object, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value[name].apply(value, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be applied to the wrong object, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value[name].apply(object, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be applied to the wrong object, leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
