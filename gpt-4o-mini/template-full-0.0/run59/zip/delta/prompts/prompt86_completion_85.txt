Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the condition to always evaluate to false, preventing the merging of operations based on attributes, which could lead to unexpected results in the `push` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also cause the condition to always evaluate to false, similar to using `null`, thus preventing the merging of operations based on attributes and potentially leading to an incorrect state of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object would always be considered a different object than any other object, causing the condition to evaluate to false and preventing the merging of operations based on attributes, which could lead to an incorrect representation of the operations.

DONE.
