  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` variable is an array, and `this.ops.length` would return the length of the array, while `this.peekLength()` returns the length of the current element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index++
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.index` would be incremented, which would affect the behavior of the `this.hasNext()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a constant that represents a value that is larger than any finite number, and using it in the comparison would always result in the left-hand side being smaller than the right-hand side.

DONE.
