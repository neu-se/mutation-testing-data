  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celle'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'cellos'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "cello". Replacing it with `'celle'` would result in an incorrect plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celloes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'cellos'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "cello". Replacing it with `'celloes'` would result in an incorrect plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celli'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'cellos'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "cello". Replacing it with `'celli'` would result in an incorrect plural form.

DONE.
