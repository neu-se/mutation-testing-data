  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with "o" and have a vowel before it, while the new code fragment matches words that end with "o" and have a consonant before it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with "o" and have a vowel before it, while the new code fragment matches words that end with "o" and have a vowel after it.
