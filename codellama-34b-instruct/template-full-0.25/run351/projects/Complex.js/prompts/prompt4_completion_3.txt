  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value for the same input.

DONE.
