  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass three arguments to `baseArgs.concat()` instead of two, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have an extra element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only one argument to `baseArgs.concat()` instead of two, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have only one element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the first argument to `baseArgs.concat()`, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have an undefined element at the beginning.

DONE.
