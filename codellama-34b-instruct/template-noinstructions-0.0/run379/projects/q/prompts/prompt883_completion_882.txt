  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error, rather than rejecting it, which could cause the error to be silently ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the error to the `deferred.reject` method, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the intended error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be passed as the error to the `deferred.reject` method, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the intended error.

DONE.
