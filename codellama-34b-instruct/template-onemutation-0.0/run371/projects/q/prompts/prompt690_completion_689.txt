  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `arguments` object from index 0, while the new code fragment slices it from index 1, which would exclude the first argument from the slice.

DONE.
