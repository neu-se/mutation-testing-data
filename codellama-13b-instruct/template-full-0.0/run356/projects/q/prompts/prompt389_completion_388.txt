  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called instead of the `fulfilled` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called instead of the `fulfilled` function, which would cause the promise to be in a pending state instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression would be evaluated to `undefined`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

DONE.
