  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `w.length - 1` would return the length of the word minus 1, while the new code fragment `w.length - 2` would return the length of the word minus 2. This would cause the pluralization function to return the wrong plural form for some words.

DONE.
