 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'error'.bind(zipArchive), reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `this` context of the `error` event to the `zipArchive` object, which might cause issues if the event handler relies on the correct `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
reject('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of arguments passed to the `reject` callback, which might cause issues if the error handling logic expects the error object as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'another-error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the error message with a different string, which might cause issues if the error handling logic relies on the specific error message.

DONE.
