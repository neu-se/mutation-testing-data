  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `deferred.fail(error)` which is a shortcut for `deferred.reject(error)` and also calls `deferred.notify(error)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `deferred.fail(error)` which is a shortcut for `deferred.reject(error)` and also calls `deferred.notify(error)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `deferred.fail(error)` which is a shortcut for `deferred.reject(error)` and also calls `deferred.notify(error)`.

DONE.
