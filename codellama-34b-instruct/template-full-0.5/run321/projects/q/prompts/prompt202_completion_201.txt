  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method that returns a boolean value indicating whether a string can be found in the string, while `indexOf` is a method that returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the position of the last occurrence of a specified value in a string, while `indexOf` returns the position of the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` returns the number of characters in a string, while `indexOf` returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value.

DONE.
