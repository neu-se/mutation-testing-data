  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, whereas `isNodeFrame` checks if a stack line is from Node.js.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parseFloat` function parses a string and returns a floating-point number, whereas `isNodeFrame` checks if a stack line is from Node.js.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this function always returns true, regardless of the input, whereas `isNodeFrame` checks if a stack line is from Node.js.

DONE.
