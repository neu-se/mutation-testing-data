  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is a keyword in JavaScript that returns the type of a variable, while `type` is a function defined in the code that returns the type of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.type
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.type` is a function defined in the code that returns the type of an object, while `type` is a function defined in the code that returns the type of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because this function is different from the original function that is defined in the code, and it would return a different value for the input "criterion".

DONE.
