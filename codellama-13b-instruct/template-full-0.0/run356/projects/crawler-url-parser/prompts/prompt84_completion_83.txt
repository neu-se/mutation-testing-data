  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the trimmed text of the current element, while the modified code fragment returns the trimmed text of the current element and then calls the `trim()` method on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().replace(/\s+/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the trimmed text of the current element, while the modified code fragment returns the text of the current element with all whitespace characters removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the trimmed text of the current element, while the modified code fragment returns the uppercase version of the text of the current element.

DONE.
