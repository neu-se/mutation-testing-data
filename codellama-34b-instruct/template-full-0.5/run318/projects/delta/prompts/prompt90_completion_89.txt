  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' &&
          newOp.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `newOp.retain` is a number, but the modified fragment also checks if it is greater than 0. This would cause the code to behave differently if `newOp.retain` is a negative number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' &&
          lastOp.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `lastOp.retain` is a number, but the modified fragment also checks if it is greater than 0. This would cause the code to behave differently if `lastOp.retain` is a negative number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
