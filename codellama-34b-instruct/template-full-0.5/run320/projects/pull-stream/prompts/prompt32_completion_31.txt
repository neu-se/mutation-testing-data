  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(null, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.apply(null, ref)` is a function call with the `null` context, which means that the `this` keyword inside the `pull` function will refer to the global object, whereas in the original code, `this` refers to the `pull` function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call(null, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.call(null, ref)` is a function call with the `null` context, which means that the `this` keyword inside the `pull` function will refer to the global object, whereas in the original code, `this` refers to the `pull` function itself. Additionally, the `call` method is used instead of `apply`, which means that the `ref` array will be spread as individual arguments to the `pull` function, whereas in the original code, the `ref` array is passed as a single argument to the `pull`
