  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is raising `a` to the power of `b`, while the modified code fragment is raising `a + 1` to the power of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is raising `a` to the power of `b`, while the modified code fragment is raising `a - 1` to the power of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is raising `a` to the power of `b`, while the modified code fragment is raising `b` to the power of `a`.

DONE.
