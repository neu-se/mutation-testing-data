Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = "nonExistentKey";
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `key` to a string that does not correspond to any property in the object, causing the loop to never push any keys into the `keys` array, resulting in an empty array being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `key` to `null`, which is not a valid variable declaration. This would lead to a ReferenceError when trying to use `key` in the `object_hasOwnProperty` check, breaking the functionality of the `object_keys` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `key` to a number, which would cause the `object_hasOwnProperty` check to fail for any object properties, as the loop would not iterate over the properties correctly, leading to incorrect results in the `keys` array.

DONE.
