  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments.
