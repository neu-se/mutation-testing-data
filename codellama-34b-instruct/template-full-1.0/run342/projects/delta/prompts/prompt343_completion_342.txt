  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in a null reference error when the `transform` method calls the `getHandler` function on the next op. The code would behave differently because it would fail to handle the transform operation correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in an undefined reference error when the `transform` method calls the `getHandler` function on the next op. The code would behave differently because it would fail to handle the transform operation correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<any>
```
This would result in a typing error when the `transform` method calls the `getHandler` function on the next op. The code would behave differently because it would fail to handle the transform operation correctly.

DONE.
