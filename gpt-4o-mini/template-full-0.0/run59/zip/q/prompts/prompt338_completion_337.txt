Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect = function() { return {state: "fulfilled", value: "unexpected"}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the state returned by the inspect function to "fulfilled" with a constant value, which would cause the promise to resolve with an unexpected value instead of the actual resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected = inspect.call(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context in which the inspect function is called, potentially leading to different results if the inspect function relies on the context of the promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected = {state: "pending", value: undefined};
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the promise to always appear as "pending" regardless of its actual state, which could lead to incorrect handling of the promise's resolution or rejection.

DONE.
