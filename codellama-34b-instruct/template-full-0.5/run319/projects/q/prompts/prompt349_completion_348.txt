```

```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would not be called with the expected `promise` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would not be called with the expected `promise` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would not be called with the expected `promise` argument.

DONE.
