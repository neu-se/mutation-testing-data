  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.currLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `currLength` is not a method of the `OpIterator` class, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.nextLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextLength` is not a method of the `OpIterator` class, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekNext().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would give the length of the next operation, rather than the current one.

DONE.
