  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an extra 's' to the end of the word, which is incorrect for words that end in -us.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' }
```
This code fragment is the same as the original, but it uses a different method to extract the substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'us' }
```
This code fragment is incorrect, as it adds an extra 'us' to the end of the word, which is not the correct plural form.

DONE.
