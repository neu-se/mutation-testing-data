Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes the first argument of the original `args` array instead of all the arguments, potentially leading to incorrect function calls that expect more parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a `null` value to the `args` array, which could cause the called function to receive an unexpected `null` argument, altering its execution and potentially leading to errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(arg => arg * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms each argument in the `args` array by multiplying it by 2, which could lead to incorrect results if the function being called expects the original values.

DONE.
