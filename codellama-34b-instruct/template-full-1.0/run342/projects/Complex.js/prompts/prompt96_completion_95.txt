  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would unconditionally return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the value of `z['im']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(Infinity, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would unconditionally return a new `Complex` object with a real part of `Infinity` and an imaginary part of `0`, regardless of the value of `z['im']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['add'](Complex['INFINITY'], Complex['INFINITY']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would unconditionally return the result of adding `Complex['INFINITY']` and `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the value of `z['im']`.
