  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
alert('Hello World!');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `alert` function is a global function that displays a message in a dialog box, whereas the original code is a reference to a method called `dispatch` on a `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
12345;
```
This would result in different behavior because `12345` is a number, whereas the original code is a reference to a method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a keyword that represents the absence of a value, whereas the original code is a reference to a method.

DONE.
