Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the timezone name to 'UTC', which means the function will always return the first country associated with 'UTC', ignoring the actual input provided by the caller.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends '1' to the timezone name, potentially referencing a non-existent timezone, which would lead to returning `null` instead of the expected country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the timezone name will cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an empty array, leading to `main` being `undefined` and thus returning `null` instead of the expected country.

DONE.
