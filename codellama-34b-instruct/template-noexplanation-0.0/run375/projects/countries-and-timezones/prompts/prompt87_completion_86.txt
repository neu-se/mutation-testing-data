  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesForCountry
```
This change will cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return a different result than the original code, as it will return the timezones for the given country instead of the country for the given timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry
```
This change will cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return the country for the given timezone, but it will do so by calling the `getCountry` function with the timezone name as the argument, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This change will cause the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return the timezone for the given country, but it will do so by calling the `getTimezone` function with the country name as the argument, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

DONE.
