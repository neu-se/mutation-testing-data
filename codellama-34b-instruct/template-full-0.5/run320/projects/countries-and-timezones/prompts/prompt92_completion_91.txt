  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"random-string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountry` function to return a random string instead of a country ID, which would lead to incorrect results when calling the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountry` function to return a country ID that is one greater than the original value, which would lead to incorrect results when calling the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountry` function to return a country ID that is one less than the original value, which would lead to incorrect results when calling the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

DONE.
