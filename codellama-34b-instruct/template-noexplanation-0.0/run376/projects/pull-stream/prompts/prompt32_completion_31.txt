  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This code fragment is a direct replacement for the original code fragment, but it has a different behavior. The original code fragment calls the `pull` function with the `read` variable as the first argument and the `ref` array as the second argument. However, this code fragment calls the `pull` function with the `read` variable as the first argument and the `ref` array as the second argument, but it also includes the `ref[3]` element as a third argument. This could cause the `pull` function to behave differently than it did in the original code, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous one, but it includes an additional element in the `ref` array as a fifth argument. This could cause the `pull` function to
