  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && reason.stack != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks if the property is undefined or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && reason.stack !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` variable is undefined, and the `!==` operator checks for strict equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && "stack" in reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` keyword checks the presence of a property in the object.

DONE.
