  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values would be swapped, which would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return incorrect values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be increased by 10, which would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return incorrect values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be set to a random value between 0 and 10, which would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return incorrect values.

DONE.
