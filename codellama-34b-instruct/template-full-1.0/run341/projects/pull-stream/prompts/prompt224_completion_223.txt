  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `data` argument to the `test` function, whereas this change passes the result of calling `test` with `data` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.call(this, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `test` function with `this` set to the context object, whereas this change calls `test` with `this` set to the global context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.bind(null, data)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `data` argument to the `test` function, whereas this change passes the result of calling `test` with `data` as an argument and then immediately calling the resulting function.

DONE.
