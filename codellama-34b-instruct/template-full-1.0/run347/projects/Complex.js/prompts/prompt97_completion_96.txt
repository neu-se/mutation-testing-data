  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part is incorrect. The code is supposed to alternate between positive and negative signs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the real part is incorrect. The code is supposed to alternate between positive and negative signs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part is supposed to be multiplied by the square root of the variable 'a'.

DONE.
