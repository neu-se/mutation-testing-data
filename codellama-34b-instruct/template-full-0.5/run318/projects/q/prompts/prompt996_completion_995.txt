  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` argument would cause the node resolver to always resolve the promise, even if an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument would cause the node resolver to never resolve the promise, even if it's successful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` argument would cause the node resolver to resolve the promise with a `null` value, even if it's successful.

DONE.
