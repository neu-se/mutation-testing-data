  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + i*b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential function with a complex number, which is not what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + i*b) - Math.exp(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential function with a complex number, which is not what the original code does. Additionally, it would subtract the exponential function evaluated at 1, which is not the same as subtracting 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + i*b) - a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential function with a complex number, which is not what the original code does. Additionally, it would subtract the real part of the complex number, which is not the same as subtracting 1.

DONE.
