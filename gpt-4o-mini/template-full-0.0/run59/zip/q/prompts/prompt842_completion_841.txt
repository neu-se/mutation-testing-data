Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(ms, error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `then` method instead of the `timeout` method, which would not handle the timeout logic properly and would not reject the promise after the specified milliseconds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout(ms + 1000, error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra 1000 milliseconds to the timeout duration, potentially allowing the promise to resolve when it should have timed out, leading to unexpected behavior in promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout(0, error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the timeout to 0 milliseconds, which would cause the promise to reject immediately, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or not, thus altering the intended timeout functionality.

DONE.
