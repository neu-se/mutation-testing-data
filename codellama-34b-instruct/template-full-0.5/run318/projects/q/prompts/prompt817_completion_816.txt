  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is intended to handle fulfilled promises, and using `rejected` instead would cause the rejection to be handled by the `onUnhandledError` function, which would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is intended to handle fulfilled promises, and using `progressed` instead would cause the progress notification to be handled by the `onUnhandledError` function, which would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is intended to handle fulfilled promises, and using `null` instead would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null`, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
