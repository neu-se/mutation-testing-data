  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.Australian
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` is a method that returns a promise, while `Q.Australian` would be undefined and would throw an error if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.Canadian
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` is a method that returns a promise, while `Q.Canadian` would be undefined and would throw an error if called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.Discover
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` is a method that returns a promise, while `Q.Discover` would be undefined and would throw an error if called.

DONE.
