Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error('File already exists')
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a generic Error object instead of a custom error object created by the `createError` function, potentially affecting error handling and logging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.error('File already exists')
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs an error message to the console instead of throwing an error, allowing the program to continue executing without interrupting the flow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return createError(ENOTFOUND, 'open', filename)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an error object instead of throwing it, and also uses a different error code (`ENOTFOUND` instead of `EEXIST`), potentially affecting error handling and propagation.

DONE.
