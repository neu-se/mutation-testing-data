  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `tokens` is an array, and `undefined` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `tokens` is an array, and `tokens.length` is the number of elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[0] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `tokens` is an array, and `tokens[0]` is the first element in the array.

DONE.
