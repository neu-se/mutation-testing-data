  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always evaluate to `true` if `currentUrlStr` is not an empty string, even if it contains illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would always evaluate to `false` if `currentUrlStr` contains illegal characters, even if it is not an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.length > 0 && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would always be greater than 0 if `currentUrlStr` is not an empty string, even if it contains illegal characters.

DONE.
