  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a function, and `isStopIteration === true` is always false, so the code inside the `if` block would never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a function, and `isStopIteration !== true` is always true, so the code inside the `if` block would always be executed, even if the `isStopIteration` function returns a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a function, and `isStopIteration()` would call the function and return its result, which could be a truthy or falsy value. If the function returns a truthy value, the code inside the `if`
