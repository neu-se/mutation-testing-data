  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would result in a "1" being added to the imaginary component of the complex number, while the modified code fragment would result in a "0" being added.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would result in a "1" being added to the imaginary component of the complex number, while the modified code fragment would result in a "2" being added.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would result in a "1" being added to the imaginary component of the complex number, while the modified code fragment would result in the character "a" being added.

DONE
