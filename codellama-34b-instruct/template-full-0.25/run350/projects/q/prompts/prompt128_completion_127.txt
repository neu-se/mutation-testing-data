  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key used to check for the property would be off by one, potentially causing the test to pass even if the property is not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key used to check for the property would be off by one, potentially causing the test to fail even if the property is present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, "key"
```
This would result in different behavior because the key used to check for the property would be a string, which would not match the key used in the original code.

DONE.
