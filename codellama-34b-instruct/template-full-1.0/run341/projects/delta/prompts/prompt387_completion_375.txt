  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.nextLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextLength` is a different method than `peekLength` and would return the length of the next operation, rather than the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation in the other iterator, which could result in different behavior if the two iterators are not in sync.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.nextLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation in the other iterator, which could result in different behavior if the two iterators are not in sync.

DONE.
