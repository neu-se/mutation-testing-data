  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned substring would be one character longer than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned substring would be two characters longer than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned substring would be three characters longer than the original code.

DONE.
