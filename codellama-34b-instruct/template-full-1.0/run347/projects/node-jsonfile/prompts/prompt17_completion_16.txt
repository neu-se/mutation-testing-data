  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` when `options` is an object, regardless of its contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.toString() === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` when `options` is an object, regardless of its contents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options.toString() === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` when `options` is an object, regardless of its contents.

DONE.
