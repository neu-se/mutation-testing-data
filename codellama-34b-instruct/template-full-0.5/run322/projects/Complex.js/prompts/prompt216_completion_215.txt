  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` is a function that returns the value of the first argument raised to the power of the second argument, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that returns the exponential value of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` is a function that returns the square root of the argument, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that returns the exponential value of the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` is a function that returns the natural logarithm of the argument, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that returns the exponential value of the argument.

DONE.
