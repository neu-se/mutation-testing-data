  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is changed to 2, which would return a different slice of the arguments array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is added, which would return a different slice of the arguments array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is added, which would return a different slice of the arguments array.

DONE.
