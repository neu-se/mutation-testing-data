  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/e/, 'a') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern is reversed, so it would replace "e" with "a" instead of "a" with "e".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern is the same as the original, but the function is now using a different variable name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'i') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern is the same as the original, but the replacement string is different, so it would replace "a" with "i" instead of "a" with "e".

DONE.
