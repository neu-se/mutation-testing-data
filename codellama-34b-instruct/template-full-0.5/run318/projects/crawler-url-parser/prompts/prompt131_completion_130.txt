This would result in different behavior because the original code only replaces the first occurrence of `/index.[a-z]+$`, while this code replaces all occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '')

linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/')
```
This would result in
