  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args || []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator in the original code fragment is used to provide a default value for the `args` parameter if it is not provided, whereas the replacement code fragment uses the `var` keyword to declare a new variable called `args`. This change would cause the code to behave differently if the `args` parameter is not provided, as it would result in an error being thrown instead of using a default value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg1 || arg2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator in the original code fragment is used to provide a default value for the `args` parameter if it is not provided, whereas the replacement code fragment uses the `var` keyword to declare a new variable called `args`. This change would cause the code to behave differently if the `args` parameter is not provided, as it would result in an error being thrown instead of using a default value.
