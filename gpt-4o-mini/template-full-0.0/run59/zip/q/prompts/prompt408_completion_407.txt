Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly identify non-promise objects (like plain objects) as promises, leading to false positives in promise checks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true for all objects, including non-promise objects, thus failing to accurately determine if the object is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat `null` as a promise, which would lead to misleading results when checking for promise status.

DONE.
