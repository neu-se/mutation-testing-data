 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` value would be replaced with the `data` value, which might not be what the developer intended. This could cause issues if the `data` value is falsy and should be treated as an error condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` value would be replaced with `null`, which might not be what the developer intended. This could cause issues if the `end` value is expected to be a boolean or a specific error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('This is a bug')
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object would be created and passed to the callback, even if the `end` value is `true`. This could cause issues if the error is not expected or handled properly by the calling code.

DONE.
