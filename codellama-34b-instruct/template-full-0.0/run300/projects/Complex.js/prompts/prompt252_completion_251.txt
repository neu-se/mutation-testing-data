  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(b)` would return a value between -1 and 1, while `cosm1(b)` would return a value between -2 and 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(a)` would return a value between -1 and 1, while `cosm1(a)` would return a value between -2 and 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a + b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(a + b)` would return a value between -1 and 1, while `cosm1(a + b)` would return a value between -2 and 0.

DONE.
