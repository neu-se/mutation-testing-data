Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
positive
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the positive patterns for both positive and negative filtering, effectively ignoring the negative patterns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[], this._micromatchOptions
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use an empty array of patterns for negative filtering, effectively not filtering out any entries based on negative patterns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
negative, { ...this._micromatchOptions, dot: !this._micromatchOptions.dot }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the `dot` option for negative patterns, potentially changing which entries are matched or not.

DONE.
