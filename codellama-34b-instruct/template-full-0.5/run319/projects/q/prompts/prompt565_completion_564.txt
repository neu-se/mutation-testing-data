  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Exception")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only threw the `exception` object, while this new code fragment throws a new error object with the message "Exception".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only threw the `exception` object, while this new code fragment throws the `exception` object with the original message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(exception.message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only threw the `exception` object, while this new code fragment throws a new error object with the same message as the `exception` object.

DONE.
