  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `length` is falsy, while this replacement checks if `length` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `length` is falsy, while this replacement checks if `length` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `length` is falsy, while this replacement checks if `length` is less than 0.

DONE.
