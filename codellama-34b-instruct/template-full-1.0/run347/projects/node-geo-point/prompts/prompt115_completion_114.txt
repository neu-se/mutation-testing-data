  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate[1] * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the second element of the coordinate array instead of the first, which would cause the calculation of the latitudinal distance to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate[0] * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the first element of the coordinate array twice, which would cause the calculation of the longitudinal distance to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate[0] * coordinate[1] * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the product of the two coordinates instead of their sum, which would cause the calculation of the distance to be incorrect.

DONE.
