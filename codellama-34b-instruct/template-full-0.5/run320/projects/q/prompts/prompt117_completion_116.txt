  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid argument for the `indexOf` method, and would cause the code to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid argument for the `indexOf` method, and would cause the code to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object, and would cause the code to search for the index of `this` in the array, which would likely return a different result than searching for the index of `self`.

DONE.
