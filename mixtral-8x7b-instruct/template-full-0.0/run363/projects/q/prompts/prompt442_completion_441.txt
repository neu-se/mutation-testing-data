 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"unhandledrejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now case-sensitive and the process object might not emit the event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"unhandledRejectionHandler"
