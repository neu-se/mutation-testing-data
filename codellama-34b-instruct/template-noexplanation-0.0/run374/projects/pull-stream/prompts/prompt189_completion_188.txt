  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, array[i++]
```
This change will cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `null` when the array is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, array[i--]
```
This change will cause the function to return the previous element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i], array[i++]
```
This change will cause the function to return the current element in the array twice, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
