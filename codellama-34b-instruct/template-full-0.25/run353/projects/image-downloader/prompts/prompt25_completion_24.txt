  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This would result in different behavior because `__filename` returns the path of the current module, whereas `__dirname` returns the path of the current module's parent directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the parent directory of the given path, whereas `__dirname` returns the path of the current module's parent directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last component of the given path, whereas `__dirname` returns the path of the current module's parent directory.

DONE.
