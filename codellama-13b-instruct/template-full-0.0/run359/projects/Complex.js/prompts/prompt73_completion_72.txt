  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Invalid input");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to throw an error if the input is invalid, rather than silently returning a complex number with NaN values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a complex number with infinite values, rather than silently returning a complex number with NaN values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(NaN, NaN);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a complex number with NaN values, rather than silently returning a complex number with infinite values.

DONE.
