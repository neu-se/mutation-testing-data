  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.hostname == linkurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `hostname` returns the hostname without the port number, whereas `host` returns the hostname with the port number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.origin == linkurl.origin
```
This would result in different behavior because `origin` returns the protocol, hostname, and port number of the URL, whereas `host` only returns the hostname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.href == linkurl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `href` returns the entire URL, whereas `host` only returns the hostname.

DONE.
