 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the length being used for the comparison and potentially cause incorrect operations to be performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator's next operation instead of the minimum length of both iterators.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the length being used for the comparison and potentially cause incorrect operations to be performed.

DONE.
