  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' && firstOther.attributes == null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `firstOther.retain` is a number, but the new code fragment checks if `firstOther.retain` is a number and `firstOther.attributes` is null. This change would cause the code to behave differently if `firstOther.attributes` is not null, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
