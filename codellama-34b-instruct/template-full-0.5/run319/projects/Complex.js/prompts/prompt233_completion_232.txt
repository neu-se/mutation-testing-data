  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different result when `a` and `b` are both negative, as the original code fragment would return a positive result in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different result when `a` and `b` are both positive, as the original code fragment would return a negative result in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different result when `a` and `b` are both negative, as the original code fragment would return a positive result in this case.

DONE.
