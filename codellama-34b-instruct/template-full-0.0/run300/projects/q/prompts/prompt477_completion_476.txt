  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to remove the wrong element from the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to remove the wrong element from the `unhandledReasons` array, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled reasons.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to remove the wrong element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, leading to incorrect tracking of reported unhandled rejections.

DONE.
