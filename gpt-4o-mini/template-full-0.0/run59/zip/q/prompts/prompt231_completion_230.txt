Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array instead of the end, which would change the order in which progress listeners are invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because pushing `null` into the `progressListeners` array would add a placeholder that does not represent a valid listener, potentially causing errors when trying to invoke it later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from the `progressListeners` array, which would lead to the loss of the last registered progress listener instead of adding a new one.

DONE.
