  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `["1", <line number>]` instead of the actual file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `["undefined", <line number>]` instead of the actual file name and line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `["null", <line number>]` instead of the actual file name and line number.

DONE.
