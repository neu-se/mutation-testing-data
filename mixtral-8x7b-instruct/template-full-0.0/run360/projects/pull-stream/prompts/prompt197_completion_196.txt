 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (<PLACEHOLDER>)` condition would always evaluate to false, causing the code to skip the inner conditional block that handles the case when the source has already ended normally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (<PLACEHOLDER>)` condition would check if the `map` variable is equal to `undefined` instead of checking if `busy` is false. This could cause unexpected behavior if the `map` variable is ever set to `undefined` during the execution of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (<PLACEHOLDER>)` condition would call the `map` function with the `data` argument instead of checking if `busy` is false. This could cause unexpected behavior if the
