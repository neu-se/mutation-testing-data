  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arraySlice` is a different function than `arguments`, and would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var baseArgs = array_slice(arguments, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs` is defined as a different variable than `arguments`, and would have a different scope and usage.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object context, which is different from the `arguments` object.

DONE.
