  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `descriptor[op]` method, whereas the original code passes all the arguments in the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments except the first one to the `descriptor[op]` method, whereas the original code passes all the arguments in the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(["extra argument"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an extra argument to the `descriptor[op]` method, whereas the original code passes only the arguments in the `args` array.

DONE.
