  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function with the `this` value set to `continuer`, which is not the intended behavior. The `bind` method should be called on the `continuer` function with the `this` value set to the `generator` object.

DONE.
