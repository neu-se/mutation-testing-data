  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only takes the first element of the `args` array, whereas the original code fragment takes the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args[0], name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the first element of the `args` array as the name of the method to invoke, whereas the original code fragment uses the `name` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", args
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the entire `args` array as the second argument to the `dispatch` method, whereas the original code fragment passes an array containing only the `name` and `args` variables.

DONE.
