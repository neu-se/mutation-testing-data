  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would no longer be called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed("", undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called with invalid arguments, potentially causing an error or unintended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
    return progressed.apply(null, arguments);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called in a different context, potentially causing issues if the function relies on the `this` value or lexical scope.

**Bonus**: If we wanted to make a more intentional change to the code, we could replace the PLACEHOLDER with a stub function that always returns a specific value, for example:
```
function() {
    return "stub value";
}
