  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, but this modified code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "This is a bug";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not return a string, but this modified code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a value, but this modified code fragment does not.

DONE.
