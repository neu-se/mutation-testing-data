Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String(attempt3[2])
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the line number to a string instead of keeping it as a number, which could lead to type-related issues when the line number is used in further calculations or comparisons.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(attempt3[2], 10) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the line number by 1, which could lead to incorrect line number references when analyzing stack traces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[2] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the line number by 2, which would distort the actual line number and potentially mislead debugging efforts.

DONE.
