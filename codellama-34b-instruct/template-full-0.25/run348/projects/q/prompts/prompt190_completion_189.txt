  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first capture group of the regex match, which is the filename, instead of the second capture group, which is the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third capture group of the regex match, which is not defined in the regex pattern, so it would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire match of the regex pattern, which is the entire stack trace line, instead of just the line number.

DONE.
