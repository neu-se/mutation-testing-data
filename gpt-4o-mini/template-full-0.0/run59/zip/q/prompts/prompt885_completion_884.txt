Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument of `nodeArgs` to the `fapply` method instead of all the arguments, potentially causing the Node function to not receive the necessary parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a `null` value to the `nodeArgs` array, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the Node function being called, as it would receive an additional `null` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` would cause the `fapply` method to not receive any arguments at all, which would likely lead to an error when the Node function attempts to access its expected parameters.

DONE.
