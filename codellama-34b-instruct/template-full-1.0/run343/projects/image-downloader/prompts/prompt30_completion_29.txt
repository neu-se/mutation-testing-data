  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the characters from the right side of the string instead of the left side, which could result in a different URL being requested.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substring(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the first 10 characters of the string instead of the entire string, which could result in a different URL being requested.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the string instead of the first character, which could result in a different URL being requested.

DONE.
