  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus === minus
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the sum of `plus` and `minus` was equal to zero, while this new code fragment is checking if `plus` is equal to `minus`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus - minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the sum of `plus` and `minus` was equal to zero, while this new code fragment is checking if the difference between `plus` and `minus` is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the sum of `plus` and `minus` was equal to zero, while this new code fragment is checking if `minus` is equal to zero.

DONE.
