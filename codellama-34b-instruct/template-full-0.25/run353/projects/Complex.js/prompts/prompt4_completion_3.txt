  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` directly, while the modified code fragment uses `x + 1`, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` directly, while the modified code fragment uses `x - 1`, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` directly, while the modified code fragment uses `x * 2`, which is a different value.

DONE.
