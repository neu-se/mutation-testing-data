  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with the constant `1`, which would cause the calculation of the distance to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with the `sin` function, which would cause the calculation of the distance to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with the `tan` function, which would cause the calculation of the distance to be incorrect.

DONE.
