  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.push(...rules.reverse());
```
This code fragment will push the rules in the opposite order than the original code, which could potentially cause issues with the policy's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.push(...rules.slice(1));
```
This code fragment will push all but the first rule in the policy, which could potentially cause issues with the policy's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.push(...rules.filter((rule) => rule.query(path, verb, ctx) === false));
```
This code fragment will push only the rules that explicitly deny the action, which could potentially cause issues with the policy's behavior.

DONE.
