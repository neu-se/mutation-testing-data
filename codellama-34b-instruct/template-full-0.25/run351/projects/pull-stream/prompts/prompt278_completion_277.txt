  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is null. If `mapper` is null, the original code would return `id`, while this new code would return `!mapper`, which is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is not null. If `mapper` is not null, the original code would return `id`, while this new code would return `!mapper`, which is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper
