  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `2`, which would cause the `baseArgs` array to have one fewer element than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `2`, which would cause the `baseArgs` array to have one more element than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `2`, which would cause the `baseArgs` array to have a different length than expected.

DONE.
