Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, which would change the logic of the subtraction operation when one of the operands is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for infinity, meaning that the condition would pass when the current complex number is not infinite, potentially leading to incorrect results when both numbers are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the current complex number is zero instead of checking for infinity, which could lead to incorrect handling of cases where the complex number is infinite.

DONE.
