 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the result when the input is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a) - Math.exp(-a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it does not include the factor of 2 in the hyperbolic sine calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a) + Math.exp(-a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the formula for hyperbolic cosine instead of hyperbolic sine.

DONE.
