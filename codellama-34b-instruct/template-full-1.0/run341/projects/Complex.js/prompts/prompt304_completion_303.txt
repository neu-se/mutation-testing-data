  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-a` would change the sign of the argument passed to the `Math.sin()` function, which would result in different values being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of the argument passed to the `Math.sin()` function, which would result in different values being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the result of the `Math.sin()` function, which would result in different values being returned.

DONE.
