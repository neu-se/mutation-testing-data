Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that `elem.insert` is always a string or an array with a `length` property, which may not be the case, leading to potential runtime errors or incorrect length calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a constant value of 1 to the length for every `insert` operation, which would incorrectly inflate the total length count.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds the value of `elem.delete` to the length, which does not make sense in the context of calculating the length based on `insert` operations, potentially leading to negative or incorrect length values.

DONE.
