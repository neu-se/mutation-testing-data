  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']();
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` is a method that checks if the complex number is equal to zero, while `isInfinite` is a method that checks if the complex number is equal to infinity. Using `isZero` instead of `isInfinite` would cause the code to enter the `if` block when the complex number is zero, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a method that checks if the complex number is equal to infinity, while `isZero` is a method that checks if the complex number is equal to zero. Using `isInfinite` instead of `isZero` would cause the code to enter the `if` block when the complex number is infinite, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN'](
