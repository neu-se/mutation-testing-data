Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the argument of the complex number to its absolute value, which could lead to incorrect calculations when determining the complex number's representation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the real part of the complex number instead of the argument, which would not correctly represent the angle of the complex number in polar coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi']
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the phase angle (phi) instead of the argument (arg), which may not be defined in the same context and could lead to incorrect results when parsing the complex number.

DONE.
