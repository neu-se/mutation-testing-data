  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b > x || x > b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `x` is between `-b` and `b`, while the new code fragment is checking if `x` is greater than `b` or less than `-b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b || x < -b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `x` is between `-b` and `b`, while the new code fragment is checking if `x` is greater than `b` or less than `-b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b && x < -b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `x` is between `-b` and `b`, while the new code fragment is checking if `x` is greater than `b` and less than `-b`.

DONE.
