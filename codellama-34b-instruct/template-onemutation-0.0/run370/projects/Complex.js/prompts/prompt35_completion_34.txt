  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the function to return a different value if `b` is not equal to 0, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code.

DONE.
