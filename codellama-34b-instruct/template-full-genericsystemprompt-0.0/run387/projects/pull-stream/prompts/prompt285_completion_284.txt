  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` only passes the `data` argument to the callback function, while this modified code fragment passes both `null` and `data` as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` only passes the `data` argument to the callback function, while this modified code fragment passes both `data` and `null` as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` only passes the `data` argument to the callback function, while this modified code fragment passes only `data` as an argument.

DONE.
