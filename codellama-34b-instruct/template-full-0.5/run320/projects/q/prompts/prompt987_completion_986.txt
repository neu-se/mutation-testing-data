  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(name);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` variable is not being passed as the first argument to the `post` method, which is a required argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift(name);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` variable is being passed as the first argument to the `post` method, but it is being passed as an array element rather than a separate argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.splice(0, 0, name);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` variable is being passed as the first argument to the `post` method, but it is being passed as an array element rather than a separate argument.

DONE.
