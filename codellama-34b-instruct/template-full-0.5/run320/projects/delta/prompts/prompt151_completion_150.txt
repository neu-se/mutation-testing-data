  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `-` operator, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain * firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator is used instead of the `-` operator, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain / firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator is used instead of the `-` operator, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

DONE.
