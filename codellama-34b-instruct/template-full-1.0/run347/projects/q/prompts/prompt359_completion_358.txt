  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `value` is a parameter that refers to the resolved value of the promise. If the resolved value is not provided, the `value` parameter will be `undefined`, which could cause the `.then` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `value` is a parameter that refers to the resolved value of the promise. If the resolved value is `null`, the `.then` method will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a primitive value, and `value` is a parameter that refers to the resolved value of the promise. If the resolved value is `true`, the `.then` method will resolve with the provided `value`.

DONE.
