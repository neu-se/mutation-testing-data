 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function checks if the rejected reason is not null or undefined before removing the rejection from the unhandled rejections array. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `null`, the rejection will not be removed from the array, causing the length of the array to be larger than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function calls `trackRejection` with the `reason` argument, which is expected to be the value describing the failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('An error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `track
