  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `undefined` argument would be passed to the `dispatch` function, potentially causing it to throw an error or behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be passed as the third argument to the `dispatch` function instead of the second, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the second argument to the `dispatch` function instead of the `op` function, which could cause the function to throw an error or behave differently.

DONE.
