  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is `Not-a-Number`, while `!isNaN` checks if a value is not `Not-a-Number`. This change would cause the `isNaN` function to always return `false`, which would cause the `Complex` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isNaN` checks if a value is `Not-a-Number`. This change would cause the `Complex` function to return incorrect results for finite numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a built-in method that checks if a value is `Not-a-Number`, while `isNaN` is a legacy method that is longer
