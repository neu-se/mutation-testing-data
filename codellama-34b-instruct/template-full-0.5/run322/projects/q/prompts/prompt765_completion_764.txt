  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would attempt to add `1` to the `promise` object, which would likely result in a `TypeError` since `promise` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) { return value + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a new promise that resolves to the value of `promise` plus `1`, which would be different from the original behavior where `promise` is resolved to its original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would return a new promise that is rejected with the value of `promise`, which would cause the `allResolved` method to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled promise with an array
