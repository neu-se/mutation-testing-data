  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, so `all` would not be able to iterate over its elements and would instead return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, so `all` would not be able to iterate over its elements and would instead return a resolved promise with an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[1, 2, 3]` is an array of numbers, so `all` would be able to iterate over its elements and would return a resolved promise with an array of the same numbers.

DONE.
