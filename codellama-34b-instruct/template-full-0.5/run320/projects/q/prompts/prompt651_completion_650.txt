  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a different method name than "post", and would cause the code to attempt to retrieve the value of a property rather than invoking a method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a different method name than "post", and would cause the code to attempt to set the value of a property rather than invoking a method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is a different method name than "post", and would cause the code to attempt to delete a property rather than invoking a method.

DONE.
