 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['<filename>', 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number would always be 0, which might not reflect the actual line number in the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['<filename>', '<line number>']
