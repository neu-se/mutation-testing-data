  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with the wrong line number, potentially causing the stack trace to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with the wrong line number, potentially causing the stack trace to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with the wrong line number, potentially causing the stack trace to be incorrect.

DONE.
