Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the addition to subtraction, which could lead to negative results when `b` is non-zero, affecting the calculation of the hypotenuse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses `a` instead of `b`, which would yield a different result for the hypotenuse calculation, potentially leading to incorrect distance measurements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the constant `1`, which would alter the expected result of the hypotenuse calculation, potentially leading to an underestimation of the distance.

DONE.
