 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred object using the `Q.defer()` method instead of the `defer()` function provided in the local scope. This could lead to unexpected behavior as the behavior of `Q.defer()` might differ from the local `defer()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred object using the `Promise.defer()` method instead of the local `defer()` function. This could lead to unexpected behavior as the behavior of `Promise.defer()` might differ from the local `defer()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `deferred` as an empty object instead of a deferred object. This would cause errors when trying to call methods like `deferred
