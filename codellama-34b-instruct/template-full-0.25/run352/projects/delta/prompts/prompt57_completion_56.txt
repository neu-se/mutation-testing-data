  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops` is an array, rather than checking if `ops.ops` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && Array.isArray(ops.ops) && ops.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the `ops.ops` array has a length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && Array.isArray(ops.ops) && ops.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `ops.ops` array has a length of 0, rather than checking if it has a length greater than 0.

DONE.
