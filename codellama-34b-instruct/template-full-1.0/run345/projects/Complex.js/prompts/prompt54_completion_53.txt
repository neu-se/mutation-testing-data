  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would multiply the argument by 2, which could result in a different result than using the original argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'].toFixed(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toFixed(2)` method would round the argument to 2 decimal places, which could result in a different result than using the original argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt()` function would take the square root of the argument, which could result in a different result than using the original argument.

DONE.
