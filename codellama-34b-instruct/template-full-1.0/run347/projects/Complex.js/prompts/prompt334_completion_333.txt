  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `acot` function return a different value for imaginary part of the input `c` when `b !== 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `acot` function return the same value for imaginary part of the input `c` when `b === 1`, which would cause the function to return incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `acot` function return a different value for imaginary part of the input `c` when `b` is not undefined, which would cause the function to return incorrect results in certain cases.

DONE.
