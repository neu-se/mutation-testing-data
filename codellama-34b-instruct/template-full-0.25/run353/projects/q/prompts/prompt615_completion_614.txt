  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that resolves to `undefined` instead of a promise that resolves to the value of the `key` property of the `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that resolves to `undefined` instead of a promise that rejects with a `TypeError` because the `object` is not a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that resolves to `undefined` instead of a promise that rejects with a `TypeError` because the `object` is not a valid object.

DONE.
