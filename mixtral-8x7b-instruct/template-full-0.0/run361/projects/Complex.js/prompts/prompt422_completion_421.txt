 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the denominator is zero, while this change would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` even when the numerator is also zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses strict equality `===`, while this change would consider `-0` and `0` as equal due to the use of loose equality `==`. This could lead to unexpected results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the denominator is zero, while this change would return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the real part of the complex number is negative, regardless of whether the denominator is zero or not.

DONE.
