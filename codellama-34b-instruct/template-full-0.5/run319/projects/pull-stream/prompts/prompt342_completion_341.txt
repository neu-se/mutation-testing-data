  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` function only if `cb` is truthy, whereas the original code calls it regardless of the value of `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` function only if `cb` is falsy, whereas the original code calls it regardless of the value of `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` function only if `cb` is not equal to `onAbort`, whereas the original code calls it regardless of the value of `cb`.

DONE.
