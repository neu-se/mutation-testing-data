  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `getHandler` method to retrieve a handler for the given embed type, whereas this replacement code would simply return an empty function, which would not handle any embed types in the same way as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `getHandler` method to retrieve a handler for the given embed type, whereas this replacement code would return `null`, which would not handle any embed types in the same way as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `getHandler` method to retrieve a handler for the given embed type, whereas this replacement code would log a message to the console, which would not handle any embed types in the same way as the original code.

DONE.
