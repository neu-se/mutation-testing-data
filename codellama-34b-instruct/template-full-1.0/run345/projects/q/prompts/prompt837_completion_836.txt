  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.nonExistentMethod()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` object would not have a `nonExistentMethod` method, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` object would not have an `apply` method, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.nonExistentMethod()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` object would not have a `nonExistentMethod` method, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

DONE.
