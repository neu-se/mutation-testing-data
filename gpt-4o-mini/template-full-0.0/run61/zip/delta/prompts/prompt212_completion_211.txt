Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for an empty array instead of a non-empty one, which would prevent the first operation of `other` from being pushed into `delta` when `other` has operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an invalid condition (length cannot be negative), which would always evaluate to false, thus skipping the push operation regardless of the actual length of `other.ops`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of `other.ops` is not equal to one, which would allow the push operation only if there is exactly one operation in `other`, potentially leading to unexpected results when `other` has multiple operations.

DONE.
