  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `all` returns a promise that is fulfilled when all promises in the input array are fulfilled, whereas `allSettled` returns a promise that is fulfilled when all promises in the input array have settled, regardless of whether they are fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).race
```
This would result in different behavior because `race` returns a promise that is fulfilled when any one of the promises in the input array is fulfilled, whereas `allSettled
