  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `resetUnhandledRejections(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which means that the `resetUnhandledRejections` function was called with an empty array as an argument. However, the `resetUnhandledRejections` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it is not possible to determine the exact behavior of the code with this modification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
