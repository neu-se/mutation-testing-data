  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the peeked type is 'insert' before checking the length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (otherIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the length of the peeked element from the first iterator, not the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (firstLeft > 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the length of the peeked element from the first iterator, not the absolute value of firstLeft.

DONE.
