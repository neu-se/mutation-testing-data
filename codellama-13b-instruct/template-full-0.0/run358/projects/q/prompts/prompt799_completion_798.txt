  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(function (value) {
    return value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original promise, while this code fragment returns a new promise that is resolved with the original promise's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(function (value) {
    return Q(value);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original promise, while this code fragment returns a new promise that is resolved with the original promise's value, but wrapped in a Q promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then(function (value) {
    return Q.resolve(value);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original promise, while this code fragment returns a new promise that is resolved with the original promise's value, but wrapped in a Q promise and resolved using Q.resolve.
