  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(bearing) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the bearing value would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted by 1 degree in the direction of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(bearing) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the bearing value would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted by 1 degree in the opposite direction of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(bearing) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the bearing value would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted by 2 degrees in the direction of the bearing.

DONE.
