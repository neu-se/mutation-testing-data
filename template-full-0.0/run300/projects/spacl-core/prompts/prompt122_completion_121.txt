  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.search` returns the index of the first match, while `path.match` returns the matched substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.replace` replaces the matched substring with a new string, while `path.match` returns the matched substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.split` splits the string into an array of substrings, while `path.match` returns the matched substring.

DONE.
