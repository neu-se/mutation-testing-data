  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + 'xyz'
```
This would result in different behavior because it manipulates the `verb` variable by concatenating it with the string `'xyz'`, which would cause the `query` method to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `verb` variable to uppercase, which would cause the `query` method to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the `verb` variable as a number, which would cause the `query` method to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
