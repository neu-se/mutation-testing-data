  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` is a property that indicates whether a promise has been resolved or rejected, whereas `isPromise` is a function that checks if a value is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf()` returns the resolved value of a promise, whereas `isPromise` checks if a value is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return true; }, function() { return false; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the fulfillment or rejection handler, whereas `isPromise` checks if a value is a promise.

DONE.
