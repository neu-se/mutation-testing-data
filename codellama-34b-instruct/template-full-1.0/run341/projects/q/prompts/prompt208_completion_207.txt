  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue;
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method of the `Function` object in JavaScript, and it is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array. In this case, the `nearerValue` object is not a function, so using `apply` on it would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
evaluate(nearerValue);
```
This would result in different behavior because `evaluate` is a method of the `Function` object in JavaScript, and it is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array. In this case, the `nearerValue` object is not a function, so using `evaluate` on it would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return nearerValue;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `nearerValue` object instead
