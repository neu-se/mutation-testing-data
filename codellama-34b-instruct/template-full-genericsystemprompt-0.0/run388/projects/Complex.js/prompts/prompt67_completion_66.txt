  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the array is exactly 2, while the modified code fragment checks if the length is less than 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the array is exactly 2, while the modified code fragment checks if the length is greater than 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length === 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the array is exactly 2, while the modified code fragment checks if the length is exactly 3.

DONE.
