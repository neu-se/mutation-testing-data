  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for equality between `thisOp.attributes` and `otherOp.attributes`, while the replacement code would be checking for equality between `thisOp.delete` and `otherOp.attributes`, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for equality between `thisOp.attributes` and `otherOp.attributes`, while the replacement code would be checking for equality between `thisOp.attributes` and `otherOp.retain`, which is a
