  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '$')
```
This code fragment is a function call to the `reduce` method of the `parts` array, with a callback function that concatenates the current segment with the accumulator. The accumulator is initialized with the string `$`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '')
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous one, but the accumulator is initialized with an empty string instead of `$`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '^')
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous two, but the accumulator is initialized with the string `^` instead of `$` or an empty string.

DONE.
