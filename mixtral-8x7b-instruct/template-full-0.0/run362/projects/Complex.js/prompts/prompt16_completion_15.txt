 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 *
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying with 1 has no effect in the original code, but it would change the type of `a` to a number, potentially causing unexpected results in other parts of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` calculates the square root of a number, which is not the same as taking the absolute value. This could lead to incorrect results or even errors when the input is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` calculates the exponential function of a number, which is not the same as taking the absolute value. This could lead to incorrect results or even errors when the input is negative.

DONE.
