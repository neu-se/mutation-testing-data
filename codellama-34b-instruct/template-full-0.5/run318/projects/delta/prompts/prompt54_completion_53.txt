  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original check for an array, potentially causing the code to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ops !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops` is not an object, which would be true for non-object types such as numbers or strings, but not for arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of `ops` is 0, which would be true for an empty array, but not for a non-empty array.

DONE.
