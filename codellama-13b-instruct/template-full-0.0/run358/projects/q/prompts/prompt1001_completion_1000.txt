  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `dispatch` method of the `Q` object, while the buggy code fragment uses the `dispatch` method of the `object` variable. This could result in different behavior if the `object` variable is not a `Q` object or if it has a different implementation of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `dispatch` method of the `Q` object, while the buggy code fragment uses the `dispatch` method of the `object` variable.
