  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would capture two more characters than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would capture a fixed number of characters, rather than the same number of characters as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a part of the string starting from the second character, rather than the first character as in the original code fragment.

DONE.
