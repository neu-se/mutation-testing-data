  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().failure
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect().failure` is not a valid property, whereas `object.inspect` is a function that returns information about the object's fulfillment state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect().fulfilled` is a boolean value indicating whether the object is fulfilled, and it might not be what the author intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because `.state` is a property that returns the fulfillment state of the object, unlike `.inspect()`, which returns information about the object.

DONE.
