  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include a forward slash at the end of the path, which would cause the path to be considered invalid if it does not end with a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include a forward slash at the end of the path, which would cause the path to be considered valid if it ends with a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include a plus sign at the end of the path, which would cause the path to be considered invalid if it does not end with a plus sign.

DONE.
