  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the result to be the same as the original code fragment, but with the opposite sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['im']+1) * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part before multiplying it by the number of places, which would result in a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['im']*places)+1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would first multiply the imaginary part by the number of places and then add 1, which would also result in a different result.

DONE.
