  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve a nonexistent country named "foo" from the data.json file, causing the `getCountry` function to return `null` instead of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve a country with an undefined or null id from the data.json file, causing the `getCountry` function to return `null` instead of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, 'bar')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve a country named "bar", but the country with that name doesn't exist in the data.json file, causing the `getCountry` function to return `null` instead of an object.

DONE.
