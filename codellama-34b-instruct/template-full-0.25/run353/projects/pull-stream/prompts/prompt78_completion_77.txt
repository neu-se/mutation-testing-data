  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function would be called with a `null` argument, which would cause it to return immediately without executing the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function would be called with an `undefined` argument, which would cause it to return immediately without executing the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function would be called with a `true` argument, which would cause it to execute the loop indefinitely.

DONE.
