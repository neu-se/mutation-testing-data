  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` method would return a different value than the original code, which could cause issues in the code that uses the `size` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` method would return a different value than the original code, which could cause issues in the code that uses the `size` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` method would return a different value than the original code, which could cause issues in the code that uses the `size` method.

DONE.
