 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'di', 'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule added 'die' as a string, but this change adds 'di' as a string, which would match different words and potentially cause incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^di$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ces' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule added 'die' as a string, but this change adds a regular expression that matches the string 'di', and the function returns the input string with 'ces' appended, which would cause incorrect pluralization for words like 'die'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'die', function(w) { return w + 'ces' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule added 'dice' as the second argument, but this change adds a function that appends 'ces' to the
