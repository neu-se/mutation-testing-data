  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is not a function, while this replacement checks if it is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof stream !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is not a function, while this replacement checks if it is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is not a function, while this replacement checks if it is an instance of the `Function` class.

DONE.
