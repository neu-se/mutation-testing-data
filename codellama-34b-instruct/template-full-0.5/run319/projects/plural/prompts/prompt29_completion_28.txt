  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement function would return the wrong plural form for words like "thesis" and "crisis".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement function would return the correct plural form for words like "thesis" and "crisis", but would also change the plural form for other words that were not intended to be changed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
