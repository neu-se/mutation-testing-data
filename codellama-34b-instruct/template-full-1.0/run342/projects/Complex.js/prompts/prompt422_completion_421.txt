  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
* this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the asterisk operator would cause the code to multiply the variable by the value of 'im', rather than checking if the variable is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the code to subtract the variable from the value of 'im', rather than checking if the variable is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.im
```
This would result in different behavior because the dot operator would cause the code to access the 'im' property of the 'this' object, rather than checking if the variable is equal to 0.

DONE.
