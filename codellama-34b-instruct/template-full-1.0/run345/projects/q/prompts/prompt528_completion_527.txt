  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `Q` object instead of the `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the string `"foo"` as an argument to the `inspect` method, whereas the original code did not pass any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect("bar")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the string `"bar"` as an argument to the `inspect` method, whereas the original code passed the string `"foo"`.

DONE.
