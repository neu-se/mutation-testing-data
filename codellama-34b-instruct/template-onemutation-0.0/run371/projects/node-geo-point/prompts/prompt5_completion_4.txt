  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `point` is an object and has the properties `type` and `coordinates`, while the new code fragment checks if `point` does not have the properties `type` and `coordinates`.

DONE.
