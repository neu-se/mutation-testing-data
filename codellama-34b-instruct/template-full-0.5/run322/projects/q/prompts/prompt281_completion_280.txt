  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the slice of the `arguments` object starting from the second element, whereas the original code fragment returns the `arguments` object as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the slice of the `arguments` object starting from the third element, whereas the original code fragment returns the `arguments` object as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the slice of the `arguments` object starting from the first element and ending at the second element, whereas the original code fragment returns the `arguments` object as is.

DONE.
