  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `_resolved` is a different function than `_rejected`, and it would be called with the same arguments as `_rejected` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a different function than `_rejected`, and it would be called with the same arguments as `_rejected` in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a different function than `_rejected`, and it would be called with the same arguments as `_rejected` in the original code.

DONE.
