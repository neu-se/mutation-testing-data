  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong argument to the `peekLength` method, causing it to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to return the length of the array, rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong argument to the `peekLength` method, causing it to return a different value.

DONE.
