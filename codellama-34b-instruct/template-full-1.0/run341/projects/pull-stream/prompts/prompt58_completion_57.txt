  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if `done` is a function that returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if `done` is a function that returns `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw an error if `done` is not a function, regardless of whether it is `true` or `false`.

DONE.
