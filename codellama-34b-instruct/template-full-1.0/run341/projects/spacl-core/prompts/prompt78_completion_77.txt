  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rules.reverse()` will return a reversed version of the array, which would cause the for loop to iterate over the rules in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rules.slice()` will return a shallow copy of the array, which would cause the for loop to iterate over a copy of the original rules array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.filter(r => r.name === 'admin')
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rules.filter(r => r.name === 'admin')` would return a new array containing only the rules with the name 'admin', which would cause the for loop to iterate over a subset of the original rules array.

DONE.
