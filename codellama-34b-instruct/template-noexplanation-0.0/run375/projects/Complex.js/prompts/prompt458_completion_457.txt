  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the complex number is NaN (Not a Number) instead of checking if it is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the complex number is finite instead of checking if it is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && this['isNaN']()
```
This code fragment checks if the complex number is both infinite and NaN, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
