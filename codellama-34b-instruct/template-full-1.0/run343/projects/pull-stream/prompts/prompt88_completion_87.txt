  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `!prop` is always `false`, while `prop` is a function that returns a value based on the input data. If the input data has a truthy value, the function will return a truthy value, but if the input data has a falsy value, the function will return a falsy value. By replacing `prop` with `!prop`, we are essentially inverting the result of the function, which could cause the tests to pass even if the actual function is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop + 1` is always a number, while `prop` is a function that can return a value of any type. By adding 1 to the result of the function, we are changing the type of the output, which could cause the tests to fail even if the actual function is working correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
