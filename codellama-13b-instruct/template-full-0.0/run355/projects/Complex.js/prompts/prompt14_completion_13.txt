  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosm1` function is used to calculate the cosine of a number, and replacing it with `Math.sin` would cause the function to return the sine of the number instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosm1` function is used to calculate the cosine of a number, and replacing it with `Math.tan` would cause the function to return the tangent of the number instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosm1` function is used to calculate the cosine of a number, and replacing it with `Math.cosh` would cause the function to return the hyperbolic cosine of the number instead.

DONE.
