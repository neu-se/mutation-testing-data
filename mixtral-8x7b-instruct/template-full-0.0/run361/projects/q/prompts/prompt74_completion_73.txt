 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with a delay of 1ms instead of being called synchronously. This could cause tests to pass that assume the `flush` function is called immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
flush(0)
