  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function computes the sine of a number, while `sinh` computes the hyperbolic sine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function computes the cosine of a number, while `sinh` computes the hyperbolic sine of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function computes the tangent of a number, while `sinh` computes the hyperbolic sine of a number.

DONE.
