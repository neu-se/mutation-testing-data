  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.getHandler` is a function that returns a handler for a given embed type, but by replacing it with a function that returns `null`, the `transform` method would not be able to find a handler for the embed type, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => { throw new Error('Handler not found'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.getHandler` is a function that returns a handler for a given embed type, but by replacing it with a function that throws an error, the `transform` method would not be able to find a handler for the embed type, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => { return { transform: () => { return null; } }; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.
