  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, and `read + 1` would result in a different function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, and `read * 2` would result in a different function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, and `read.source` would result in a different function.

DONE.
