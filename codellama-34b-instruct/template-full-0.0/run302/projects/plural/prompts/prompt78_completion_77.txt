  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'geese')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the pluralization function, while this code fragment would attempt to add a rule that already exists, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'gooses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the pluralization function, while this code fragment would attempt to add a rule that is not correct, causing the pluralization function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'goose')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the pluralization function, while this code fragment would attempt to add a rule that is not correct, causing the pluralization function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
