  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide by zero for the given input, causing a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the value of the expression, causing the final result to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the value of the expression, causing the final result to be different.

DONE.
