  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue.valueOf()` would return the value of the `nearerValue` promise, which may not be the same as the value of the `resolvedPromise` promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.valueOf()` would return the value of the `resolvedPromise` promise, which may not be the same as the value of the `nearerValue` promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(nearerValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(nearerValue)` would create a new promise that resolves to the value of the `nearerValue` promise, which may not be the same as the value of the `resolvedPromise` promise.

DONE.
