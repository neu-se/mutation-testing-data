  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `/` at the end would cause the regex to match an extra character, potentially resulting in a different match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)\/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `\` at the end would cause the regex to match a literal `/` character, potentially resulting in a different match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)\1/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `\1` at the end would cause the regex to match the same character as the first capture group, potentially resulting in a different match.

DONE.
