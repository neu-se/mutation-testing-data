  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.resolve(message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method would be called on the resolved promise, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value of `message` instead of `newPromise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.reject(message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called on the resolved promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the value of `message` instead of being resolved with `newPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.notify(message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method would be called on the resolved promise, which would cause the promise to emit a notification with the value of `message` instead of being resolved with `newPromise`.

DONE.
