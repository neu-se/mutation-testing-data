Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ENOTFOUND, 'open', filename
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error code from `EEXIST` (file already exists) to `ENOTFOUND` (file not found), which would lead to incorrect error handling in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
EACCES, 'open', filename
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error code from `EEXIST` (file already exists) to `EACCES` (permission denied), which would incorrectly indicate a permission issue instead of a file existence issue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ENOENT, 'open', filename
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error code from `EEXIST` (file already exists) to `ENOENT` (no such file or directory), which would incorrectly indicate that the file does not exist instead of already existing.

DONE.
