 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `pageurl_path` starts with `linkurl_path`, instead of checking if `linkurl_path` is included in `pageurl_path`. This might cause false negatives when the `linkurl_path` is a substring of `pageurl_path` but not at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.indexOf(linkurl_path) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `linkurl_path` is present in `pageurl_path` using the `indexOf` method. However, this method might not be suitable for checking if `linkurl_path` is a substring of `pageurl_path` when the `linkurl_path` is a prefix of `pageurl_path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
