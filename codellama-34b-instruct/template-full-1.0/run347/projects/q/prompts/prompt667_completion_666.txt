  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the all function expects an array but it will get an index instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the all function expects an array but it will get an array containing the first element, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the all function expects an array but it will get the first element of an array, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
