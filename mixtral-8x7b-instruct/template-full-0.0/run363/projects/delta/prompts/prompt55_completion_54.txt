 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.prototype.toString.call(ops) === '[object Array]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Object.prototype.toString` to check if `ops` is an array, which is less efficient and less compatible with strict equality checks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops instanceof Array
