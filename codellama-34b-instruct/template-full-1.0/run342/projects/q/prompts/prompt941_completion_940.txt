  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the input array would be sliced starting from the first element, rather than from the second element, which is what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, arguments.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the input array would be sliced starting from the second element, rather than from the first element, which is what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, arguments.length - 1, arguments.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the input array would be sliced starting from the last element, rather than from the second element, which is what the original code does.

DONE.
