  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable would be a string instead of a function, and calling it as a function would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable would be a number instead of a function, and calling it as a function would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable would be `null` instead of a function, and calling it as a function would result in a runtime error.

DONE.
