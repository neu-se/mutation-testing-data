  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the property `key` from the object `object`, whereas the original code fragment would only get the value of the property `key` from the object `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the property `key` of the object `object` to the value `value`, whereas the original code fragment would only get the value of the property `key` from the object `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would post the value `value` to the property `key` of the object `object`, whereas the original code fragment would only get the value of the property `key` from the object `object`.
