  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method takes a string and returns an object representing the URL, while `URL.resolve` takes two URLs and returns a new URL resolved relative to the first URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.resolve` method takes two URLs and returns a new URL resolved relative to the first URL, while `URL.parse` takes a string and returns an object representing the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.combine
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.combine` method takes two URLs and returns a new URL resolved relative to the first URL, while `URL.parse` takes a string and returns an object representing the URL, and `URL.resolve` takes two URLs and returns a new URL resolved relative to the first URL.

DONE.
