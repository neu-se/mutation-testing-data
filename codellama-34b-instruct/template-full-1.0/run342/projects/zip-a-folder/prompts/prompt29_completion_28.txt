  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the returned promise with a value of `null`, instead of the original code, which resolved it with the value of the `writeStream.close()` method, which is a `}` character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject('Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the returned promise with the string `'Error'`, instead of the original code, which resolved it with the value of the `writeStream.close()` method, which is a `}` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve('Triangle')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the returned promise with the string `'Triangle'`, instead of the original code, which resolved it with the value of the `writeStream.close()` method, which is a `}` character.

DONE.
