  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query
```
This would result in different behavior because `query` and `matches` are different methods of the `Policy` class, and they may have different implementations or behaviors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!policy.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `matches` method, which means that if the original code returned `true`, the mutated code would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method is called with different arguments, which may cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
