  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the attribute is not null, while this code checks if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] != attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the attribute is not null, while this code checks if it is not equal to itself, which will always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof attributes[key] !== 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the attribute is not null, while this code checks if its type is not the string `'null'`, which is different from the original code.

DONE.
