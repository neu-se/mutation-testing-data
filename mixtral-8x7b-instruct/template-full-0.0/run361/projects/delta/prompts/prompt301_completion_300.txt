 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would skip a line every time the predicate returns false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would not iterate over the lines correctly, always starting from the beginning of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would iterate over all the operations in the delta, regardless of their type, instead of only processing insert operations.

DONE.
