  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument passed to the `invoke` method, which is the name of the method to invoke.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments passed to the `invoke` method, which are the name of the method to invoke and the `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first three arguments passed to the `invoke` method, which are the name of the method to invoke, the `this` context, and the arguments to pass to the method.

DONE.
