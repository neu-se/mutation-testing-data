 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the global object, which may not have the same methods or properties as the `thisp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass any context to the `callback.apply()` method, potentially causing the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically refers to the `window` object, which is only available in browser environments. In a Node.js environment, this would cause an error.

DONE.
