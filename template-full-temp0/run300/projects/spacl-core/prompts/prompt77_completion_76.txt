  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which means that the new array would contain the same elements as the original array, but the elements themselves would not be cloned. This could cause issues if the elements are objects or arrays, as they would still be referenced by the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array that contains the elements of the original array, but it does not clone the elements themselves. This could cause issues if the elements are objects or arrays, as they would still be referenced by the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map((rule) => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array that contains the result of calling the provided function on each element of the original array. In this case
