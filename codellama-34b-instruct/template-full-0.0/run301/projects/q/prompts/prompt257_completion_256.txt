  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would be called instead of `fulfill`, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value)` would be called instead of `fulfill(value)`, causing the promise to be resolved with a new promise instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value + 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill(value + 1)` would be called instead of `fulfill(value)`, causing the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original.

DONE.
