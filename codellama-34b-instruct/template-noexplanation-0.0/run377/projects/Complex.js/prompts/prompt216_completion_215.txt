  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This change will cause the `sqrt` function to be called instead of `exp`, which will result in a different output for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This change will cause the `sin` function to be called instead of `exp`, which will result in a different output for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This change will cause the `cos` function to be called instead of `exp`, which will result in a different output for the same input.

DONE.
