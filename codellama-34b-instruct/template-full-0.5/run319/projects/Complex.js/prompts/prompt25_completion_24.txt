  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is equivalent to `1 + b * b`, which is a sum of 1 and the square of `b`. However, the modified code fragment is a difference of `b * b` and 1, which could result in a different value if `b` is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is equivalent to `1 + b * b`, which is a sum of 1 and the square of `b`. However, the modified code fragment is a sum of `b * b` and 1, which could result in a different value if `b` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is equivalent to `1 + b * b`, which is a sum of 1
