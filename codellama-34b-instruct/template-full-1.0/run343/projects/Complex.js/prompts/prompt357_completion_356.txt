  Sure! Here are my responses:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh(a)` returns the hyperbolic sine of `a`, which is not the same as `cosh(a)` which returns the hyperbolic cosine of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh(a)` returns the hyperbolic tangent of `a`, which is not the same as `cosh(a)` which returns the hyperbolic cosine of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coth
```
This would result in different behavior because `coth(a)` returns the hyperbolic cotangent of `a`, which is not the same as `cosh(a)` which returns the hyperbolic cosine of `a`.

DONE.
