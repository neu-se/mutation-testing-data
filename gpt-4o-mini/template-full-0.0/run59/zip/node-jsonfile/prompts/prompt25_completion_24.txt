Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'{}'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always parse an empty JSON object instead of the actual content read from the file, leading to incorrect data being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + 'extra data'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'extra data' to the content before parsing, which would likely cause a JSON parsing error if the original content is not valid JSON.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to `JSON.parse` would throw a TypeError, whereas passing the actual content would attempt to parse the JSON string, leading to different error handling behavior.

DONE.
