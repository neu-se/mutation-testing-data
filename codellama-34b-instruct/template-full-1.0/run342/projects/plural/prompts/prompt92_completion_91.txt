  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the same string instead of the plural form of the word, which would violate the principle of least astonishment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return a different string than the original, which would violate the principle of least astonishment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chihilies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return a string with an extra "h" which would violate the principle of least astonishment.

DONE.
