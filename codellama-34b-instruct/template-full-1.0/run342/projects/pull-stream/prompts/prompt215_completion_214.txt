  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function reference, but providing `null` would cause the function to return without calling the map function, causing different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function reference, but providing `undefined` would cause the function to return without calling the map function, causing different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function reference, but providing an arrow function that returns nothing would cause the function to return a different value, causing different behavior.

DONE.
