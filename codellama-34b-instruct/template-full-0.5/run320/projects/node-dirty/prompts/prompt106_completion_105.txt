  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the key of the row instead of the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the row plus one instead of just the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the row multiplied by two instead of just the value.

DONE.
