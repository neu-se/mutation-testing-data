  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `call.bind` is a different method than `call.apply`, and it has a different behavior when it comes to handling the `this` context. In the original code, `call.apply` is used to call a function with a specific `this` context, but `call.bind` would not have the same effect.

DONE.
