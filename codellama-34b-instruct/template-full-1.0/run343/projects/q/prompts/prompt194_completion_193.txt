  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number * 0
```
This would result in a different behavior because the multiplication by 0 will always result in 0, regardless of the original value of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number + 1
```
This would result in a different behavior because the addition of 1 will always result in a different value than the original input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number - 1
```
This would result in a different behavior because the subtraction of 1 will always result in a different value than the original input.

DONE.
