Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude + point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds the longitudes of both points instead of calculating the difference, which would lead to an incorrect bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude * point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the longitudes of both points instead of finding the difference, which would yield a nonsensical value for the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts a constant value (180) from the longitude of point1 instead of using the longitude of point2, which would distort the bearing calculation significantly.

DONE.
