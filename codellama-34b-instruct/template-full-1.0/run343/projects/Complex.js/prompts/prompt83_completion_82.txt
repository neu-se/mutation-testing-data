  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus > minus
```
This would result in different behavior because the clause `plus + minus === 0` checks whether the plus and minus counts are equal, while `plus > minus` checks whether the plus count is greater than the minus count. The original code fragment is checking whether the total number of plus and minus signs is even, while the modified code fragment is checking whether there are more plus signs than minus signs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(plus) > Math.abs(minus)
```
This would result in different behavior because the clause `plus + minus === 0` checks whether the plus and minus counts are equal, while `Math.abs(plus) > Math.abs(minus)` checks whether the absolute value of the plus count is greater than the absolute value of the minus count. The original code fragment is checking whether the total number of plus and minus signs is even, while the modified code fragment is checking whether there are more plus signs than minus signs and whether the absolute value of the plus count is greater than the
