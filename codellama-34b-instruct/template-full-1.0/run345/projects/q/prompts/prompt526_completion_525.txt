  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always receive the string "foo" instead of the actual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always receive undefined instead of the actual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always receive an empty array instead of the actual arguments.

DONE.
