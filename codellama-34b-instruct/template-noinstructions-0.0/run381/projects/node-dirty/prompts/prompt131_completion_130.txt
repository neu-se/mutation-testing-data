  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is a Map object, and `this._queue` is a Set object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.values()` returns an iterator over the values in the queue, while `this._queue` returns the queue itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.entries()` returns an iterator over the entries in the queue, while `this._queue` returns the queue itself.

DONE.
