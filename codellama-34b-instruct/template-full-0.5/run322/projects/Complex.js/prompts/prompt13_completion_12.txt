  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b < x || x < b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `||` (or) operator, while the new code uses `&&` (and) operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b || x < -b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `||` (or) operator, while the new code uses `>` (greater than) operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b && x < -b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `||` (or) operator, while the new code uses `&&` (and) operator.

DONE.
