  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the argument to be a URL string, while the replaced fragment is a function that takes no arguments. This would likely cause the code to error out because the URL string is not being parsed correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the argument to be a URL string, while the replaced fragment is a hardcoded string that does not represent a valid URL. This would likely cause the code to error out because the URL is not being parsed correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the argument to be a URL string, while the replaced fragment is a null value. This would likely cause the code to error out because the URL is not being parsed correctly.

DONE.
