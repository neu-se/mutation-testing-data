  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of the `tzs[key]` property, which is not present in the original code fragment. This would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of the `tzs[key]` property by 2, which is not present in the original code fragment. This would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of the `tzs[
