  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of `a`, while the mutated code fragment calculates the negative sine of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of `a`, while the mutated code fragment calculates the sine of `a + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of `a`, while the mutated code fragment calculates the sine of `a * 2`.

DONE.
