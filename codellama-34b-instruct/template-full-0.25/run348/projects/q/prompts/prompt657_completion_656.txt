  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, rather than an array containing the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, rather than an array containing the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array containing the values `1`, `2`, and `3`, rather than an array containing the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
