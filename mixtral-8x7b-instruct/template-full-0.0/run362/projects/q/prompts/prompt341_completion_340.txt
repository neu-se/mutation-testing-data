 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is used instead of a deferred object, and the `deferred.resolve()` method would not be available.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){return {resolve:function(){}, reject:function(){}, notify:function(){}};}
```
This would result in different behavior because a stub function is used instead of the `defer()` function, which creates a deferred object with `resolve`, `reject`, and `notify` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){return {resolve:function(value){}, reject:function(exception){}, notify:function(value){}};}
```
This would result in different behavior because a stub function is used instead of the `defer()` function, but the `resolve`, `reject`, and `notify` methods are defined with no implementation. This could cause the promise to never settle if the `resolve`
