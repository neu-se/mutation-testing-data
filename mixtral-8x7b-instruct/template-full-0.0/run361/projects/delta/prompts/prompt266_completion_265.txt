 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses a length of 0 instead of the actual length of the `otherOp` insert, potentially causing the deletion of more or fewer characters than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the current operation instead of the length of the `otherOp` insert, potentially causing the deletion of more or fewer characters than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete an infinite number of characters, potentially causing unexpected behavior or an error in the code.

DONE.
