  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.foo` is not a function, so the `then` method would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.bar` is not a function, so the `then` method would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.baz
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.baz` is not a function, so the `then` method would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved.

DONE.
