  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a value is NaN, while `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is finite. In the context of the code, this would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called more frequently, potentially leading to incorrect parsing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of `a` is a number, rather than checking if it is finite. This could cause the code to produce incorrect results if `a` is a non-finite value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of `a` is even, rather than checking if it is finite. This could cause the code to produce incorrect results if `a` is an odd value.

DONE.
