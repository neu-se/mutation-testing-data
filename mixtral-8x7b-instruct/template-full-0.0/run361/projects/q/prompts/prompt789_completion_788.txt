 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is used to handle rejections, not the `then` method. This change would cause the `finally` method to always return a resolved promise, even if there is an error in the `callback`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.then(undefined, rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `then` method is used to specify a rejection handler, but `undefined` is passed instead of a function. This would cause the `finally` method to always return a rejected promise if there is an error in the `callback`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.then(function() { return rejected; })
```
This would result in different behavior because a function that always returns the `rejected` argument is passed as the rejection handler. This would cause the `finally` method to always
