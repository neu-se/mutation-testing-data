  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the check for the `attributes` property, potentially leading to incorrect or incomplete processing of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!lastOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the `lastOp` variable, potentially leading to incorrect or incomplete processing of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would hardcode the `attributes` property to zero, potentially leading to incorrect or incomplete processing of operations.

DONE.
