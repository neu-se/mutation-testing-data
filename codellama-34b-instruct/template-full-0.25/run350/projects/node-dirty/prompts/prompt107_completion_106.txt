  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val, row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value are swapped, which could cause issues with the data being stored and retrieved correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value is incremented by 1, which could cause issues with the data being stored and retrieved correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value is multiplied by 2, which could cause issues with the data being stored and retrieved correctly.

DONE.
