  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This code fragment will cause the `op` function to be called with the `end` argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This code fragment will cause the `op` function to be called with the negation of the `end` argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && op
```
This code fragment will cause the `op` function to be called with the `end` argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
