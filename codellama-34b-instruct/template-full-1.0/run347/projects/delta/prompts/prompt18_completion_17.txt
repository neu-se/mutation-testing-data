  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the `b` object, even if the `a` object is not undefined or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the `a` object if it is not undefined or null, and otherwise use the `b` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ? a : b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the `a` object if it is not undefined, null, or NaN, and otherwise use the `b` object.

DONE.
