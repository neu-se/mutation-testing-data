  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is the real part of the complex number, while the `im` property is the imaginary part. Using `this['re']` instead of `this['im']` would cause the `abs` method to return the magnitude of the real part of the complex number, rather than the magnitude of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method returns the magnitude of the complex number, while `this['abs']()` would return the absolute value of the real part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['arg']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` method returns the argument (angle) of the complex number, while `this['arg']()` would return the argument of the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
