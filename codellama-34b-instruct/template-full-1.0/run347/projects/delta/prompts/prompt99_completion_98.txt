  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, -1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be decremented by 1, which would cause the op to be inserted at the previous index, rather than the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, index + 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be incremented by 1, which would cause the op to be inserted at the next index, rather than the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, -index, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be negated, which would cause the op to be inserted at the opposite end of the list, rather than the current index.

DONE.
