  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behaviors when it comes to handling arguments. `call` expects a list of arguments, while `apply` expects an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a specific `this` value and arguments that are partially applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a specific `this` value and arguments that are partially applied. In this case, the `this` value would be `null`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
