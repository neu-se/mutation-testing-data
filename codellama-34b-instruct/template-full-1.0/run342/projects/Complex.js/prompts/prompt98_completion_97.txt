  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is 'i' or 'I', while this new fragment only checks if the current token is 'i'. This would likely cause issues when parsing complex numbers with real or imaginary parts containing the letter i or I.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is less than or equal to 'i', while this new fragment only checks if the current token is less than 'i'. This would likely cause issues when parsing complex numbers with real or imaginary parts containing numbers less than 'i'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c >= 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is greater than or equal to 'i', while this new fragment only checks if the current token is greater than 'i'. This would likely
