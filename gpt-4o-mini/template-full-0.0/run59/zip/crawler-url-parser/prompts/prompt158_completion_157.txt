Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the last segment of the path without allowing for an optional trailing slash, potentially leading to incorrect comparisons when determining if two URLs are at the same level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `i` flag makes the regex case-insensitive, which could lead to unexpected matches if the URL paths contain uppercase letters, thus affecting the logic that determines the relationship between the URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag allows for global matching, which could cause the regex to match multiple segments in the path instead of just the last one, leading to incorrect behavior in the URL comparison logic.

DONE.
