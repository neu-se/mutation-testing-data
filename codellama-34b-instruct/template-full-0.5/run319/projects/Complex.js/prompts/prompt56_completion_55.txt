  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would change the value of the argument, which is used in the `Math.sin` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would change the value of the argument, which is used in the `Math.sin` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2 - a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of `Math.PI / 2` would change the value of the argument, which is used in the `Math.sin` function.

DONE.
