  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` with a delay of 0 is not the same as `setImmediate`. `setImmediate` will execute the callback function immediately after the current event loop, while `setTimeout` will execute it after the specified delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); });
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` will execute the callback function immediately after the current event loop, while `setImmediate` will execute it after the current event loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); });
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` will execute the callback function immediately after the
