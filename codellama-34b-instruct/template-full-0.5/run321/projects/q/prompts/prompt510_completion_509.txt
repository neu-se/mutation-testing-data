  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the `args` array, which would change its length and potentially cause errors in the code that uses the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `args` array would return the number of elements in the array, which would be different from the original code fragment that returned the `args` array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return a shallow copy of the `args` array, which would be a different object than the original `args` array.

DONE.
