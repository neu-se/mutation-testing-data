  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (result) {
    throw new Error("This is a bug");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to handle the resolution of the promise, but instead of returning a new promise, it throws an error. This would cause the promise to be rejected, which would trigger the `catch` method to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (result) {
    return result + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to handle the resolution of the promise, but instead of returning a new promise, it returns a new value that is one greater than the original value. This would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the new value, which would trigger the `then` method to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (result) {
    return Q.re
