  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the deferred with the result of the `dispatch` method, while this code fragment resolves it immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the deferred with the result of the `dispatch` method, while this code fragment rejects it with a test error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("Test notification");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the deferred with the result of the `dispatch` method, while this code fragment notifies it with a test notification.

DONE.
