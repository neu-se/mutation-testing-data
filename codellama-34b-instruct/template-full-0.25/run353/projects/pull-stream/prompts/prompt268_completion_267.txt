  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a null value instead of the expected data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return an error instead of the expected data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the data instead of the expected error.

DONE.
