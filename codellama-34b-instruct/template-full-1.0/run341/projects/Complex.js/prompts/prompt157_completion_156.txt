  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (0 === this.im) {
  return new Complex(this.re * z.re, 0);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is not checked, which could result in the wrong value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (0 === this.im) {
  return new Complex(this.re * z.im, 0);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is not checked, which could result in the wrong value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (0 === this.re) {
  return new Complex(this.im * z.re, 0);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is not checked, which could result in the wrong value being returned.

DONE.
