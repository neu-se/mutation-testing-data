  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the `Complex` object to have different values for its `re` and `im` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(b)` is the sine of the imaginary part of the complex number, while `Math.sin` is the sine of the real part. This would cause the `Complex` object to have different values for its `re` and `im` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2(b, a)` is the arctangent of the ratio of the imaginary part to the real part, while `Math.sin` is the sine of
