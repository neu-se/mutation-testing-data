  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the + 1 would cause the reducer function to return a different value, potentially causing the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the - 1 would cause the reducer function to return a different value, potentially causing the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the * 2 would cause the reducer function to return a different value, potentially causing the tests to fail.

DONE.
