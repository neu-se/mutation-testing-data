 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'longitude' in object
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'longitude' property exists in the object, rather than checking if the object has its own 'longitude' property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `call` method to explicitly invoke the `hasOwnProperty` method from the object's prototype, rather than checking if the object has its own 'longitude' property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.has(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Reflect.has` method to check if the 'longitude' property exists in the object, rather than checking if the object has its own 'longitude' property.

These changes would potentially expose issues in the test suite by introducing different
