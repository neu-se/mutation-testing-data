  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an object, and therefore does not have a `get` method. In the original code, `void 0` is used to represent the `this` value in the `get` method, which is an object. By replacing it with `null`, the `get` method will throw a `TypeError` when it tries to access the `length` property of `null`, which is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an object, and therefore does not have a `get` method. In the original code, `void 0` is used to represent the `this` value in the `get` method, which is an object. By replacing it with `undefined`, the `get` method will throw a `TypeError` when it tries to access the `length` property of `undefined`, which is not
