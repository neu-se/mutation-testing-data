Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html()
```
This would result in different behavior because `html()` retrieves the HTML content of the element, which may include HTML tags, while `text()` retrieves only the text content, stripping out any HTML tags.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('title')
```
This would result in different behavior because `attr('title')` retrieves the value of the `title` attribute of the element, which may not correspond to the visible text of the link, whereas `text()` retrieves the actual text displayed to the user.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` converts the text to uppercase, potentially altering the original text content and affecting any subsequent processing that relies on the original casing.

DONE.
