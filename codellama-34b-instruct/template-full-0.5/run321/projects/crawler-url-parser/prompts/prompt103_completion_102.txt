  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, which would cause the `includes` method to always return `true`, regardless of whether the text is actually included in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method is used instead of `includes`, which would cause the code to check for the presence of the text at a specific position in the URL, rather than anywhere in the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.match(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method is used instead of `includes`, which would cause the code to check for the presence of the text in the URL using a regular expression, rather than a simple string comparison.

DONE.
