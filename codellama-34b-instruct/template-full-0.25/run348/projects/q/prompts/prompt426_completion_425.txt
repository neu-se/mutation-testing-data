  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to always return the original value, rather than the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to return a value that is one greater than the original value, rather than the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to return a value that is twice the original value, rather than the resolved value.

DONE.
