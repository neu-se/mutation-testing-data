  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain || op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `op.retain` is truthy, regardless of the value of `op.attributes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes && op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if both `op.attributes` and `op.retain` are truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if both `op.retain` and `op.attributes` are truthy.

DONE.
