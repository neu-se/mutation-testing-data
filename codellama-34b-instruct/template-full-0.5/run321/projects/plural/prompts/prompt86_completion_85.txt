  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'peoples')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a plural "s" to the word "person," but the new code fragment adds a plural "es" to the word "peoples."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'persons')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a plural "s" to the word "person," but the new code fragment adds a plural "s" to the word "persons."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'individuals')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a plural "s" to the word "person," but the new code fragment adds a plural "s" to the word "individuals."

DONE.
