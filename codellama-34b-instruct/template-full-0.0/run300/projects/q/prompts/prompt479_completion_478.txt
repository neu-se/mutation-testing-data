  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the array instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the third element of the array instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the array instead of the second.

DONE.
