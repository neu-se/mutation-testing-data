 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it only returns true when both numbers are infinite, whereas the original code returns true if either number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === Infinity || z['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks the real part of the numbers for infinity, whereas the original code checks both the real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']() || z['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns true if the first number is zero or the second number's real part is infinity, whereas the original code checks both numbers for infinity.

DONE.
