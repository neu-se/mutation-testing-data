  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the attributes object, regardless of whether the attributes are equal or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.size
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the size of the attributes object, regardless of whether the attributes are equal or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.keys.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the number of keys in the attributes object, regardless of whether the attributes are equal or not.

DONE.
