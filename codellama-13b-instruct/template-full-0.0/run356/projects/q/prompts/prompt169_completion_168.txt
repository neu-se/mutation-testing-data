  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the stack line is an internal frame, while the new code fragment checks if the stack line is an internal frame and if it is, it returns true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the stack line is a node frame, while the new code fragment checks if the stack line is a node frame and if it is, it returns true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the stack line is a stop iteration, while the new code fragment checks if the stack line is a stop iteration and if it is, it returns true.

DONE.
