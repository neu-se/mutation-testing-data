Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the `options.reviver` function, which is intended to transform the parsed JSON object, potentially leading to incorrect or unexpected results when the JSON is parsed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of `options.reviver` will cause the JSON parsing to proceed without any reviver function, which may lead to different object structures or types than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options.reviver || null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to use a fallback to `null` if `options.reviver` is falsy, which could lead to situations where the reviver is not applied even when it is defined, depending on its truthiness.

DONE.
