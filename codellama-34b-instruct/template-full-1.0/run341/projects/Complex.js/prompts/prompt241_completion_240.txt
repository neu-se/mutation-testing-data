  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
k
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a value that is not related to the original function, which could cause issues in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a value based on the wrong expression, which could cause issues in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1+x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a value based on the wrong expression, which could cause issues in the code.

DONE.
