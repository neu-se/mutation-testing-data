  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete !== 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'

This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if `newOp.delete` is not a number, the condition would be true even if `lastOp.delete` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

        typeof lastOp.delete !== 'number'
```
