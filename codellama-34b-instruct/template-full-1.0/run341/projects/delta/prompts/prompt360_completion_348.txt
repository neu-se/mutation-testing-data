  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext() && !otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the absence of both iterators instead of checking for their presence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext() || otherIter.peekType() == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the absence of the other iterator or its peekType being null, instead of checking for their presence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext() && (otherIter.peekType() == 'delete' || otherIter.peekType() == null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the absence of the this iterator and the presence of a delete or null peekType in the other iterator, instead of checking for their presence.

DONE.
