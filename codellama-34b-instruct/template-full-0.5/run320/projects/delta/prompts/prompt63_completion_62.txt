  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `attributes` object instead of the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string representation of the `attributes` object instead of the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of the keys of the `attributes` object instead of the object itself.

DONE.
