  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with the resolved value of the promise, rather than the rejected reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onUnhandledError, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with the rejected reason of the promise, rather than the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would not be called at all, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
