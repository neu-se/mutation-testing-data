  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad * 23
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 23 would cause the calculation of bearing to be altered, leading to a non-accurate result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 90 from the rad2deg value would cause the calculation of bearing to be altered, leading to a non-accurate result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the random number generated by Math.random() would cause the calculation of bearing to be altered, leading to a non-accurate result.

DONE.
