  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to match a path that does not start with a slash, which is not allowed according to the specification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to match a path that does not start with a slash, but only if the path starts with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/.
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to match a path that does not start with a slash, and only if the path starts with a slash and ends with a dot.

DONE.
