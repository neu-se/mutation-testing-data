 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(flush, 100);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called with a delay of 100ms instead of being called asynchronously in the next event loop iteration. This could cause tests that rely on the immediate execution of `flush` to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
noop;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function would be replaced with a no-op function, effectively disabling the asynchronous execution of tasks. This could cause tests that rely on the asynchronous behavior of the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Mutated code'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown every time the `requestTick` function is called. This could cause tests that do not expect an error to be thrown to fail, providing a starting
