 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
['name', policy]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the key of the map from a policy name to the string 'name', which would make it impossible to retrieve the policy using the original name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
