  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would cause the arguments to be passed to the `post` method in reverse order, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.concat(["extra argument"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument would be added to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first element of the `nodeArgs` array, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
