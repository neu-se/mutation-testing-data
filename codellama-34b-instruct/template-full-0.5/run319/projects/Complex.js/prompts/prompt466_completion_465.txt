  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks whether `b` is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks whether `a` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks whether `a + b` is equal to 0.

DONE.
