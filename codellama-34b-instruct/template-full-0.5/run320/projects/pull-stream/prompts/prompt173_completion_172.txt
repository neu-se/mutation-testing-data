  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the array is zero, rather than if the array is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the array is zero, rather than if the array is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the array is less than zero, rather than if the array is an array.

DONE.
