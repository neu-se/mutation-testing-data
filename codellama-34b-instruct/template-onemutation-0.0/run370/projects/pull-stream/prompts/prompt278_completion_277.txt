  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while the new code fragment checks if `mapper` is strictly equal to `null`. If `mapper` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or `false`), the original code fragment would still execute the `id` function, while the new code fragment would not.

DONE.
