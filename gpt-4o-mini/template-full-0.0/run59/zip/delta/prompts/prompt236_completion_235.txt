Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to retrieve one more operation than intended, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect operation being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, which means it would be processing operations from the wrong iterator, leading to incorrect results in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the length of the next operation without advancing the iterator, which could lead to an infinite loop or incorrect handling of the operations in the delta.

DONE.
