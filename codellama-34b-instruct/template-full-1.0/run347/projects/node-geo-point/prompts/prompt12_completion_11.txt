  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would accept any 
non-"Point" string, even if the object doesn't have the property "type",
 which is a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof point.type !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would accept 
an object with the property "type" of any type, not just a string,
 which is a bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty("type")
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would accept an object 
without the property "type", which is a bug.

DONE.
