Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the zoom level by 1, which would change the tile coordinates returned by the `toTile` method, potentially leading to incorrect tile mapping.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ x: 0, y: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a fixed tile coordinate of (0, 0) regardless of the actual longitude and latitude, which would not reflect the intended geographical location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it mistakenly uses the latitude instead of the longitude for the x-coordinate calculation, leading to incorrect tile coordinates.

DONE.
