  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code to execute the `if` block when the iterator's next type is not an insert, rather than when it is an insert.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the iterator's next operation, rather than its type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of the other iterator's next operation, rather than the current iterator's next operation.

DONE.
