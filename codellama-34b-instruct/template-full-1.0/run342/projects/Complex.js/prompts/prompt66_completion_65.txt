  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a[1]` would always refer to the second element of array `a`, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a[0]` would always refer to the first element of array `a`, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is not a property of object `a` and therefore would produce an error.

DONE.
