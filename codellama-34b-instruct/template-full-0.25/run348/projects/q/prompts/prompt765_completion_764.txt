  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves with the value of the original promise, but it would not propagate any rejection or progress notifications from the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value; }, function(error) { throw error; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves with the value of the original promise, but it would also propagate any rejection or progress notifications from the original promise.
