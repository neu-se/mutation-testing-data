  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rejected` is a boolean value that determines whether the promise is rejected or not. By negating the value with `!`, the resulting code would always evaluate to `true`, causing the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rejected` is a boolean value that determines whether the promise is rejected or not. By adding `&& false`, the resulting code would always evaluate to `false`, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rejected` is a boolean value that determines whether the promise is rejected or not. By adding `|| true`, the resulting code would always evaluate to `true`, causing the promise to
