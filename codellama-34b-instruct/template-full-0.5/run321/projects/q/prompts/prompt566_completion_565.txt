  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q.when` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the promise or the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a resolved promise, whereas `Q.when` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the promise or the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of values from the input promises, whereas `Q.when` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the promise or the promise itself.

DONE.
