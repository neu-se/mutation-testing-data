 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfilled.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` uses the provided `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` uses the provided `this` value and an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfilled.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to the provided value and pre-filled arguments, if any. In this case, using `bind` without any arguments would cause the `this` value to be set to `null` within the `fulfilled` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(function() { fulfilled; })()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code above would immediately invoke an anonymous function that returns the `fulfilled` function, but does not actually call it. This would effectively remove the `spread` method'
