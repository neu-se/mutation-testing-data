Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the input from an array of promises to a single number representing the length of the promises array, which would lead to incorrect processing of the promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the expected array of promises with `null`, causing the subsequent operations that expect an array to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the promises array with `undefined`, which would lead to errors when trying to iterate over it or access its properties, as `undefined` does not have a length or elements.

DONE.
