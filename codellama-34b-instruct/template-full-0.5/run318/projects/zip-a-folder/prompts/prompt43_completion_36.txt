  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.replace('glob', 'bug')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would change the value of `globPart`, which is used to create the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a different string than `globPart`, which is used to create the archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods would change the order of the characters in `globPart`, which is used to create the archive.

DONE.
