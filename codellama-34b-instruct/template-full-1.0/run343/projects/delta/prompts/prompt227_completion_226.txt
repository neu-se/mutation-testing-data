  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<otherOp.delete as unknown as number>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks that `otherOp.delete` is a number, which is not the case in this mutated version. In the mutated version, `otherOp.delete` is an object, which would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<delta.ops as unknown as Op[]>[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code retrieves the first element of the `ops` array using the `[]` syntax, which is not the case in this mutated version. In the mutated version, the first element of the `ops` array is retrieved using the `get()` method, which could return a different element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<delta.ops as unknown as Op[]>[length - 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code retrieves the
