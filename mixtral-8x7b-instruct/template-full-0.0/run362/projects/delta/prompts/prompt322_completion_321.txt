 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...base.ops].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from `base.ops` before slicing, which may have unintended side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
base.slice.bind(null)
