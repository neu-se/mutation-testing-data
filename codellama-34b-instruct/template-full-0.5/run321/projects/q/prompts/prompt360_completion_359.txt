  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the `done` variable, so the `if` statement would be executed even if `done` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the `if` statement would only be executed if `done` is strictly equal to `true`, which is not always the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the `if` statement would be executed if `done` is not strictly equal to `false`, which is not always the case.

DONE.
