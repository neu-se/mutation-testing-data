  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` method to return a different value for `length` in some cases, which could affect the behavior of the `rest` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` method to return a different value for `length` in some cases, which could affect the behavior of the `rest` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` method to return a different value for `length` in some cases, which could affect the behavior of the `rest` method.

DONE.
