  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would not be called when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(error) { throw error; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than being handled by the `onUnhandledError` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(result) { return result * 2; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function would be called with the result of the promise multiplied by 2, rather than the original result.

DONE.
