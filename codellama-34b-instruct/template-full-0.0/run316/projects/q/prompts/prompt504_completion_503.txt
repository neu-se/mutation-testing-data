  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, while `()` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided
