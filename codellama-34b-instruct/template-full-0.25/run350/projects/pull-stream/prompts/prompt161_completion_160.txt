  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, so if `cb` is truthy, `!cb` will be falsy, and vice versa. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch than expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator will add 1 to the value of `cb`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch than expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator will multiply the value of `cb` by 2, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch than expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
