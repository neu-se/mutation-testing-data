Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would parse the `currentUrlStr` directly instead of resolving it against the `baseUrl`, potentially leading to incorrect URL formation when the `currentUrlStr` is relative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl) + '/extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an extra path segment to the resolved URL, which would change the final URL structure and potentially lead to incorrect links being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(baseUrlStr, parsedUrl.path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `path` of the `parsedUrl` instead of the full URL, which could lead to incorrect resolution of the URL, especially if the `baseUrlStr` is not a valid URL.

DONE.
