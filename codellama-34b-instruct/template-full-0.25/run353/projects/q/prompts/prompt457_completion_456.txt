  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `unhandledRejections` is a reference to the original array. This means that any changes made to the copy would not affect the original array, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the original array with the given arguments. This means that any changes made to the new array would not affect the original array, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` returns a new array that is the result of removing the given number of elements from the original array, starting at the given index. This means that
