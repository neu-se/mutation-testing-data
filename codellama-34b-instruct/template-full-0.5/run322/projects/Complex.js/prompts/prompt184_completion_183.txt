  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of `Math.pow(b, z['re'])`, which is not the same as the original code's `new Complex(0, Math.pow(b, z['re']))`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of `-Math.pow(b, z['re'])`, which is not the same as the original code's `new Complex(0, -Math.pow(b, z['re']))`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return
