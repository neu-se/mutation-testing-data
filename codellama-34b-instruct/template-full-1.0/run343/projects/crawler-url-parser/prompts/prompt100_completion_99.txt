  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value being used for the key in the map, which could potentially cause the map to return a different value for the same key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value being used for the key in the map, which could potentially cause the map to return a different value for the same key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Date.now()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the map to always return a different value for the same key, which could potentially cause issues with the logic that is using the map.

DONE.
