Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file is being opened in write mode instead of read mode, potentially overwriting or truncating the existing file contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'wx'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file is being opened in exclusive write mode, throwing an error if the file already exists, instead of simply reading from it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file is being opened in append mode, allowing writes to the end of the file instead of reading from it, potentially causing unintended modifications.

DONE.
