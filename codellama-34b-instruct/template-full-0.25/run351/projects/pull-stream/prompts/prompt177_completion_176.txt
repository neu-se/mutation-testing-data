  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || i >= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `abort` is truthy, while this code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy or if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && i >= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy, while this code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy and `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort && i >= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy, while this code fragment checks if `abort` is falsy and `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`.

DONE.
