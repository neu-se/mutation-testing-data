  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(/at/g, "at at")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace all occurrences of "at" with "at at", which would change the stack trace and cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would remove the last character of the `stackLine`, which would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the `stackLine` into an array of substrings using the ":" character as the delimiter, and then the `[0]` index would select the first element of the array, which would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber`
