  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b * b` expression would evaluate to `0`, which would cause the `Math.sin(b * b)` function to return `0`, which would cause the `Complex` object to be initialized with `0` as the real part and `0` as the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin(b)` function would return a different value than the `Math.sin(b * b)` function, which would cause the `Complex` object to be initialized with a different real part and imaginary part.

DONE.
