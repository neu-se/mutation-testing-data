  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\//` matches any forward slash, whereas the original code fragment `spec.split` splits the string at any whitespace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` argument to `split` limits the number of splits to 1, whereas the original code fragment does not have a limit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-1` argument to `split` causes the string to be split at every occurrence of the regular expression, whereas the original code fragment splits the string at the first occurrence.

DONE.
