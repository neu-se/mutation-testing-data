  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof MessageChannel === "function")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `MessageChannel` is defined as a property of the global object (`typeof x !== "undefined"`), while this modified code checks if it's a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof MessageChannel == "number")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `MessageChannel` is defined as a property of the global object (`typeof x !== "undefined"`), while this modified code checks if it's a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof MessageChannel === "boolean")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `MessageChannel` is defined as a property of the global object (`typeof x !== "undefined"`), while this modified code checks if it's a boolean.

DONE.
