  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, whereas `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, will have its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` is a method that returns a string representing the source code of the function, whereas `apply` and `call` are methods that call the function with the provided `this` value and arguments.

DONE.
