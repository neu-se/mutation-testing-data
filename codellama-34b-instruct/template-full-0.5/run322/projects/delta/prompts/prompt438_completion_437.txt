  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but the replacement code fragment checks if it is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is not a number or a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but the replacement code fragment checks if it is an object. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is not a number or an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but the replacement code fragment checks if it
