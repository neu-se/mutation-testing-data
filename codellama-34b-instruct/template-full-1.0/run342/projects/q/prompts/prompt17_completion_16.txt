  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code `definition` defines a function call to be invoked later. Replacing it with an empty function would not result in the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw "()"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code `definition` is a function call, and replacing it with a throw statement would cause an error to be raised.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){ return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code `definition` defines a function call to be invoked later. Replacing it with a function that returns immediately would not result in the same behavior.

DONE.
