  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would always return the same value, instead of returning the next value in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail" + "head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return a string concatenation of the `tail` and `head` values, instead of returning the next value in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail" - "head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the difference between the `tail` and `head` values, instead of returning the next value in the queue.

DONE.
