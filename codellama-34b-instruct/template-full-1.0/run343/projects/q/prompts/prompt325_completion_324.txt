  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```placeholde
promise.POSTS
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.POSTS` method is not defined in the current code, so it would result in a ReferenceError when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```promise
createPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `createPromise` is not defined in the current code, so it would result in a ReferenceError when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```promise
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is a method that rejects the promise with a value, whereas the original code fragment was `promise`, which was a promise object.

DONE.
