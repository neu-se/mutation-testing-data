  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(2)` would skip over the next two elements in the iteration, whereas `thisIter.next()` would move on to the next element in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.previous()` would move backwards in the iteration, whereas `thisIter.next()` would move forwards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` would move on to the next element in the `other` iteration, whereas `thisIter.next()` would move on to the next element in the `this` iteration.

DONE.
