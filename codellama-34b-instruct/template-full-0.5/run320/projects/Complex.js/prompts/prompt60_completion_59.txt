  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would change the value of the expression and potentially cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would change the value of the expression and potentially cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 would change the value of the expression and potentially cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

DONE.
