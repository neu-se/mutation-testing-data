  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the accumulated value, while this new code fragment returns the accumulated value plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the accumulated value, while this new code fragment returns the accumulated value multiplied by two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the accumulated value, while this new code fragment returns the length of the accumulated value.

DONE.
