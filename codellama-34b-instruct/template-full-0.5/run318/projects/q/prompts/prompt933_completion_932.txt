  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passed the `args` array to `Q.denodeify`, while this modified code fragment also passes the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function as an additional argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the entire `args` array to `Q.denodeify`, while this modified code fragment only passes a slice of the `args` array starting from the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `args` array to `Q.denodeify` in the order it was defined, while this modified code fragment passes the `args` array in reverse order.

DONE.
