  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the complex number is infinite, which is not the same as checking if the complex number itself is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](z)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the complex number is infinite, but it would do so by comparing the complex number to itself, which would always return true.

DONE.
