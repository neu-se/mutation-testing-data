  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `replace` method, which would remove any characters after the first semicolon in the `href` attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').split("=")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `split` method, which would split the `href` attribute into an array of substrings using the equals sign as the delimiter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `slice` method, which would return a substring of the `href` attribute starting from the first character and ending at the second-to-last character.

DONE.
