  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly calculate the latitude of the destination point, leading to errors in the final output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly calculate the longitude of the destination point, leading to errors in the final output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly calculate the longitude of the destination point, leading to errors in the final output.

DONE.
