  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect(object.keys());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method is not defined on the `object` parameter, and will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect(object[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` parameter is an array, and the `inspect()` method expects a string or a function as its argument, not an array element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect(object.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not defined on the `object` parameter, and will throw an error.

DONE.
