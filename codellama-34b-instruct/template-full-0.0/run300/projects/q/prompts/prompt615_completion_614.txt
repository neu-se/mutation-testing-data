  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that resolves to `null`, rather than a promise that resolves to the value of the `object` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that resolves to `undefined`, rather than a promise that resolves to the value of the `object` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that resolves to the string `"foo"`, rather than a promise that resolves to the value of the `object` property.

DONE.
