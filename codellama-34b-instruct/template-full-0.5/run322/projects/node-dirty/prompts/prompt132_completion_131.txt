  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] of this._queue.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.entries()` returns an iterator for the keys and values of the queue, whereas `this._queue` returns an iterator for the keys only.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] of this._queue.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.values()` returns an iterator for the values of the queue, whereas `this._queue` returns an iterator for the keys only.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] of this._queue.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.keys()` returns an iterator for the keys of the queue, whereas `this._queue` returns an iterator for the keys only.

DONE.
