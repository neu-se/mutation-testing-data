  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` character is added to the end of the `part` string, which would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is used to remove all `/` characters from the `part` string, which would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method is used to split the `part` string into an array of substrings, and the `pop` method is used to extract the last substring from the array. This would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

DONE.
