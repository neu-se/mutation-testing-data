  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [this, arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` enforces the same `this` value as the caller, whereas `apply()` allows the caller to override the `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [this, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` expects an array of arguments, whereas `apply()` expects the arguments to be variadic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply()` method on the `this` value, which is not intended and could result in unexpected behavior.

DONE.
