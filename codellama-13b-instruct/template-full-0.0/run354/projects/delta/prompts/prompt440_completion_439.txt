  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would now be checking if `nextOp.insert` is a number, rather than a string. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.insert` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking if the length of `nextOp.insert` is 0, rather than checking if it is a string. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.insert` is not a string or if its length is not 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking if `nextOp.insert` is null, rather than checking if it is a string. This could potentially cause the code to behave
