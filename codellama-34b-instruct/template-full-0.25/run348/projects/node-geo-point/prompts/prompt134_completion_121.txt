  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of `toFixed()`, which would cause the adjusted latitude and longitude values to be off by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the result of `toFixed()` by 2, which would cause the adjusted latitude and longitude values to be twice as large as they should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the result of `toFixed()` by 2, which would cause the adjusted latitude and longitude values to be half of what they should be.

DONE.
