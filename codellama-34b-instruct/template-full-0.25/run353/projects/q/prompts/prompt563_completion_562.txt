  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `exception.value` would return the value of the exception, while the new code fragment `exception` would return the exception object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `exception.value` would return the value of the exception, while the new code fragment `null` would return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `exception.value` would return the value of the exception, while the new code fragment `undefined` would return undefined.

DONE.
