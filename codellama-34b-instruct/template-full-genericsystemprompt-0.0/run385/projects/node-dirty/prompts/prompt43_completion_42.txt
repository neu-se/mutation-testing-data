  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be incremented by 1, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be doubled, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be converted to uppercase, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
