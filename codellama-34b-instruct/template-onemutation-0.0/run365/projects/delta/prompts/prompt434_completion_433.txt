  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nextOp` is an object, while `null` is a primitive value. The `Op.length()` method would throw an error when called with `null` as an argument, while it would return a valid value when called with `nextOp` as an argument.

DONE.
