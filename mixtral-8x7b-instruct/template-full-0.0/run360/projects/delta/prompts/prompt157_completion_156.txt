 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prioritize deletion operations over insertion operations, which could cause unexpected behavior in the composition of the deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prioritize operations with a length greater than zero, which could cause unexpected behavior in the composition of the deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peek() !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prioritize non-null operations, which could cause unexpected behavior in the composition of the deltas.

DONE.
