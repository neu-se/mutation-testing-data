  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to exit immediately, rather than waiting for the callback to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to exit if the callback has not been called yet, rather than waiting for the callback to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to exit if the callback has been called with a non-true value, rather than waiting for the callback to be called with a true value.

DONE.
