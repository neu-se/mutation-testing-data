 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol from http to https, which might cause the URL parsing to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the protocol entirely, which might cause the URL parsing to fail or behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http:/'
