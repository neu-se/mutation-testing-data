  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a fulfilled promise, regardless of whether the input promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a rejected promise, regardless of whether the input promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pending
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a pending promise, regardless of whether the input promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
