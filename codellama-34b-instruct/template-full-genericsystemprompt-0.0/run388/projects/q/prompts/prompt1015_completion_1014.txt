  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not defined on the `deferred` object, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the method to throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but an empty function is being passed instead. This would cause the method to return a resolved promise with no value, rather than a rejected promise with an error.

DONE.
