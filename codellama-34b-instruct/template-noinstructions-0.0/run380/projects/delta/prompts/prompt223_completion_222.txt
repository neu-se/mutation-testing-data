  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the delta's ops to itself, rather than to the other delta's ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the delta's ops to a non-existent third string, which would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1].reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the delta's ops to the reversed version of the other delta's ops, which would likely result in a different diff result.

DONE.
