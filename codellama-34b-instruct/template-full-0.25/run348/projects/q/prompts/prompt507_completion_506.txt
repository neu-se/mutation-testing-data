  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array that is the concatenation of `value` and `args`, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array where each element is the result of applying the provided function to the corresponding element in the original array, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the `post` method.

DONE.
