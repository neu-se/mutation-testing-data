  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a, b, c) => a[b] = c
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the value of `c` to the property `b` of object `a`, rather than returning an array of property keys like the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a, b, c, d) => c && d && a[b] = c
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks that `c` and `d` are both truthy before assigning a value to the property `b` of object `a`, whereas the original code fragment does not perform this check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a, b, c) => b in a ? a[b] = c : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it only assigns a value to the property `b` of object `a` if that property exists, whereas the original code fragment would assign a value regardless of
