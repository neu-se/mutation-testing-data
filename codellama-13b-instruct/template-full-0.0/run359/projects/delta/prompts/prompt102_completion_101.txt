  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method is called with a non-integer argument, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method is called with the correct index, but the `ops` array is not modified in any way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length - 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method is called with the correct index, but the `ops` array is not modified in any way.

DONE.
