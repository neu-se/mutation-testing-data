  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb !== null` evaluates to `true` if `cb` is not `null`, while `!cb` evaluates to `true` if `cb` is falsy (i.e., `false`, `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test(data)` evaluates to the result of applying the `test` function to `data`, while `!cb` evaluates to `true` if `cb` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test(cb)` evaluates to the result of applying the `test` function to `cb`, while `!cb` evaluates to `true` if `cb` is falsy.
