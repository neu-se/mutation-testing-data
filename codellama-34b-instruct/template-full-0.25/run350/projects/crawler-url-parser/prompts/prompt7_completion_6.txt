  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `_has_illegal_chars` function, causing the code to execute the `if` block even if the `baseUrlStr` does not contain any illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` literal would cause the code to execute the `else` block even if the `baseUrlStr` contains illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` literal would cause the code to execute the `if` block even if the `baseUrlStr` contains illegal characters.
