 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0].constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the constructor's name of the rule is equal to 'RegExp' instead of checking if the rule itself is an instance of RegExp.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0] instanceof RegExp
