  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the specified ID, but with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, which could affect the behavior of the `deliverCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, { allTimezones: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the specified ID, but with the `allTimezones` property set to `false`, which could affect the behavior of the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, { timezones: [] })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the specified ID, but with an empty `timezones` array, which could affect the behavior of the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

DONE.
