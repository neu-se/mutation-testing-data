  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (Math.abs(b) > Math.abs(a)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition for the infinite number check, potentially returning a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (Infinity === c || Infinity === d) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the divisor is infinity, rather than the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the dividend is zero and the divisor is infinite, rather than the complex number.

DONE.
