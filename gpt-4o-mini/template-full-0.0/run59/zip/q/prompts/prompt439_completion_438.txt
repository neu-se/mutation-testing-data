Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `process.emit` function to be called with `null` instead of the actual promise, potentially leading to incorrect handling of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the `process.emit` function from being called at all, as `undefined` would not match any promise in the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to untracked rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the constructor of the promise instead of the promise itself, which would not be a valid reference for tracking unhandled rejections, potentially causing issues in the rejection handling logic.

DONE.
