  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array[0]` is always the first element of the array, while `array` is the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` is the number of elements in the array, while `array` is the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.slice(1)` is the array without the first element, while `array` is the entire array.

DONE.
