Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly remove the last two characters of the word instead of just the last character, leading to incorrect pluralization for words like "cherry" which should become "cherries".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access a character index that is out of bounds, effectively returning an empty string for the pluralization of words that should have a valid plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the entire word without removing any characters, resulting in incorrect pluralization for words like "cherry" which should become "cherries".

DONE.
