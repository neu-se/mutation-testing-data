 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise, it would be resolved with the exception as the value. This could cause the test suite to miss catching exceptions that should have been handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { throw new Error('Replacement error') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of calling the `deferred.reject` function. This could cause the test suite to miss catching exceptions that should have been handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the progress of the promise instead of rejecting it. This could cause the test suite to miss catching exceptions that should have been handled.

DONE.
