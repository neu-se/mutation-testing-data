  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether there are more elements in the iterator, whereas `iter.hasNext` is a property that returns the next element in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method returns the next element in the iterator, whereas `iter.hasNext` returns a boolean value indicating whether there are more elements in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method returns the next element in the iterator without advancing the iterator, whereas `iter.hasNext` returns a boolean value indicating whether there are more elements in the iterator.

DONE.
