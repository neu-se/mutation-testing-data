Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
eval(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` executes the string as JavaScript code, which can lead to security vulnerabilities and unexpected results, unlike `JSON.parse`, which strictly parses a JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string, whereas `JSON.parse` is intended to convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object, leading to a type mismatch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Function('return ' + content)()
```
This would result in different behavior because using `new Function` creates a new function that executes the content as code, which can lead to execution of arbitrary code, unlike `JSON.parse`, which safely parses JSON strings into objects.

DONE.
