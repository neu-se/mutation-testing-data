  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

parse(embedBaseUrlStr, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with the `baseUrlStr` argument, which is not the same as the `baseUrl` argument that is passed to the `parse` function in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

URL.parse(embedBaseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `URL.parse` function with the `embedBaseUrlStr` argument, which is not the same as the `currentUrlStr` argument that is passed to the `URL.parse` function in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(embedBaseUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `URL.parse` function with the `embedBaseUrlStr` argument and the `true` and `true` arguments, which are not the same as
