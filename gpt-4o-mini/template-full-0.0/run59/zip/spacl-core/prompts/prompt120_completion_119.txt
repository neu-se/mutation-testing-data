Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would always return `false` when `ctx` is required, leading to all queries returning `null` regardless of the path or verb.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `ctx` would cause the `matches` method to fail when it checks for properties in `ctx`, resulting in a similar outcome as if `ctx` were not provided, but it may also lead to different handling in some JavaScript environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'not-a-context'
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string instead of an object would cause the `matches` method to always evaluate the `ctx` check as `false`, leading to all queries returning `null` regardless of the path or verb.

DONE.
