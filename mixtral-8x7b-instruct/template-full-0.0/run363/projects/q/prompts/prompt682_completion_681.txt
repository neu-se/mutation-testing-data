 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value does not have a `dispatch` method, causing a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object does not have a `dispatch` method, causing a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an arrow function returns a new function, which does not have a `dispatch` method, causing a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

DONE.
