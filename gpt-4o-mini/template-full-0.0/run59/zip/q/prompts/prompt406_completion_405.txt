Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenReject` method to always reject with the provided reason, regardless of the original promise's state, effectively ignoring the promise's resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lead to the same outcome as using `null`, causing the `thenReject` method to reject with the reason, but it would also introduce ambiguity in the handling of the promise, as `undefined` is not a valid promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"not a promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenReject` method to treat the string as a non-promise value, leading to an immediate rejection with the reason, regardless of the original promise's state, which could lead to unexpected behavior in promise chaining.

DONE.
