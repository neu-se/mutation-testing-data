  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is used to check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, and setting it to `true` would cause the code to take a different branch that would result in incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is used to check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, and setting it to `false` would cause the code to take a different branch that would result in incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = !noIM
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable is used to check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, and negating its value would cause the code to take a different branch that would result in incorrect behavior.

DONE.
