Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [name, nodeArgs])
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called from "post" to "get", which may not exist or behave differently, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs, "extraArg"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra argument to the dispatch call, which could cause the method to fail or behave incorrectly if it does not expect more than the original arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name])
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the `nodeArgs` from the arguments array, potentially causing the method to be called without the necessary parameters, leading to errors or incorrect behavior.

DONE.
