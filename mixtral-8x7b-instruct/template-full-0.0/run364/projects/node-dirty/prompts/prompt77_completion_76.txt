 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the number `0`, while this change uses `null`. The `load` event may expect a number as its second argument, and using `null` could cause unexpected behavior in the event handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'loaded', 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed from `'load'` to `'loaded'`. If there are any event listeners registered for the `'load'` event, they will not be triggered by this change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the value is changed from `0` to `this._data.size`. If the `_data` object is empty, this change would result in the `load` event being emitted with an argument of `0`, while the original code fragment would
