  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `update` method would not update the value stored at the given key, as it would be setting the value to `undefined` instead of the result of the `updater` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `update` method would not update the value stored at the given key, as it would be setting the value to `null` instead of the result of the `updater` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `update` method would not update the value stored at the given key, as it would be setting the value to the current value of the key instead of the result of the `updater` function.

DONE.
