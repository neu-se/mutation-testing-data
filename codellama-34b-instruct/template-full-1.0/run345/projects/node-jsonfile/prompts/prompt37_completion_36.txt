  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bypass the `universalify` function, which is necessary for compatibility with different types of file systems.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFileSync(file, 'string', options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always write the string 'string' to the file, regardless of the contents of the `str` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFileSync(file, str.substring(0, 1), options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only write the first character of the `str` variable to the file, rather than the entire string.

DONE.
