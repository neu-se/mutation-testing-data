  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude) - deg2rad(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is not applied to `point2.longitude`, which could lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude) + deg2rad(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is applied to `point1.longitude` instead of `point2.longitude`, which could lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude) * deg2rad(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is applied to the product of `point2.longitude` and `point1.longitude`, which could lead to a different calculation of the bearing.
