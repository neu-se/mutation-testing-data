  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for a different error code, which would cause the code to behave differently when handling errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code !== 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the opposite error code, which would cause the code to behave differently when handling errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOTDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for a different error code, which would cause the code to behave differently when handling errors.

DONE.
