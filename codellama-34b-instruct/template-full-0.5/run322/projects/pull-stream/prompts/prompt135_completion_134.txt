  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `err` argument, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with two arguments, `null` and `err`, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with two arguments, `err` and `null`, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
