  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the `err` and `acc` arguments, while the new code fragment `null` is not a function and will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the `err` and `acc` arguments, while the new code fragment `undefined` is not a function and will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the `err` and `acc` arguments, while the new code fragment `function() {}` is a different function that will be called with no arguments.

DONE.
