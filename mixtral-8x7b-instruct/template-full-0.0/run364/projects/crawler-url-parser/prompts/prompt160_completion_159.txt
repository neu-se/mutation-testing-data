 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^\/]*$/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes everything after the last slash, including any query parameters, instead of only removing the last path part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/(\/[^\/]*)?$/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because it makes the last path part optional, allowing it to match URLs with or without a trailing slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/(\/[^\/]*)\/*$/, ""
