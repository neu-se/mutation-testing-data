  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"con"
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation "con" is not defined for promises, while "throw" is a valid operation that can be used to reject a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because the computer property "length" returns the number of elements in a array, while "throw" is a operation that can be used to reject a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function "apply" is used to call a function with a given "this" value and arguments provided as an array, while "throw" is an operation that can be used to reject a promise.

DONE.
