  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct object from `this.verbs`, which means that the `for...in` loop will not iterate over the same properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, which means that the `for...in` loop will not iterate over any properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, which means that the `for...in` loop will not iterate over any properties.

DONE.
