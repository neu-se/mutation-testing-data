  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is changed to an addition operator, which would cause the result to be different for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is changed to an addition operator, which would cause the result to be different for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is changed to a subtraction operator, which would cause the result to be different for certain input values.

DONE.
