  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved synchronously with a value of `null`, rather than the original behavior of resolving with the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved synchronously with a value of `undefined`, rather than the original behavior of resolving with the value of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved synchronously with a value of `1`, rather than the original behavior of resolving with the value of `value`.

DONE.
