  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'], this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the function to return the incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are added together, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are multiplied together, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
