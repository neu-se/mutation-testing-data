  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function or method to be passed as the first argument to `Q.fbind`, but passing `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function or method to be passed as the first argument to `Q.fbind`, but passing `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function or method to be passed as the first argument to `Q.fbind`, but passing `0` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
