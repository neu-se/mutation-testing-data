  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value).then(function () {
    throw new Error("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error after the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value).then(function () {
    return Q.reject(new Error("Test error"));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

DONE.
