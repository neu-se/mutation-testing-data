  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the current `this` context, whereas `this.next` refers to the `next` method of the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next[Symbol.iterator]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next[Symbol.iterator]()` returns a new iterator object, whereas `this.next` refers to the `next` method of the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next.call(null)` calls the `next` method with a `this` value of `null`, whereas `this.next` refers to the `next` method of the current object.

DONE.
