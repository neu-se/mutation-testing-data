  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then(function () { throw new Error("Buggy code"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original `Q.async(makeGenerator)` promise, but on a new promise that is created by the `then` method. This new promise will be rejected with the error "Buggy code", which will cause the promise chain to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).catch(function () { throw new Error("Buggy code"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not called on the original `Q.async(makeGenerator)` promise, but on a new promise that is created by the `catch` method. This new promise will be rejected with the error "Buggy code", which will cause the promise chain to be rejected.
