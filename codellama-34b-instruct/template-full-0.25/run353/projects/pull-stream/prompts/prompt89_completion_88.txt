  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `false` instead of `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `true` instead of `test`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test ? false : true
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator `?:` has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `false` instead of `test`.

DONE.
