  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of whether the stack line is from Node.js or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeFrame()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of whether the stack line is from Node.js or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of whether the stack line is from the Q library or not.

DONE.
