  Sure, I can help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` expects a string argument, but `rowStr.trim()` would return a trimmed string, which may not be a valid JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` expects a string argument, but `rowStr.toUpperCase()` would return an uppercase string, which may not be a valid JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` expects a string argument, but `rowStr.slice(1)` would return a slice of the original string starting from the second character, which may not be a valid JSON string.

DONE.
