  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the `src` string into an array of glob patterns, and then iterates over the array to call the `glob` method on each pattern. However, this modified code fragment would call the `glob` method on the original `src` string, which may not be a valid glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart, {});
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any options to the `glob` method, while this modified code fragment passes an empty object as options. This could potentially change the behavior of the `glob` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach
