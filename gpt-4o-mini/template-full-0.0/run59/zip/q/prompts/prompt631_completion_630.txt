Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "remove" is not a valid operation for deleting a property, which would lead to the property not being deleted and potentially causing unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because using "set" instead of "delete" would attempt to set a property rather than delete it, leading to the property being modified or created instead of removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because using "get" instead of "delete" would attempt to retrieve the value of the property rather than delete it, which would not achieve the intended effect of removing the property from the object.

DONE.
