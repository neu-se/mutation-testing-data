  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a class, while `===` checks if two values are strictly equal. In this case, `value` is not an instance of the `Promise` class, but it may be a promise-like object that has the same properties and methods as a `Promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor` is a property of an object that refers to the function that created the object. In this case, `value` may not have a `constructor` property that refers to the `Promise` function, even if it is a promise-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then === Promise.prototype.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method of a promise that returns a new promise that is resolved with the result of the
