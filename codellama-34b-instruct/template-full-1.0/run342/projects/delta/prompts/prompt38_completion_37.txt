  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because `!b` is the logical negation of `b`, which would cause the `reduce` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable from `b`, and the `reduce` method would return a different value when acting on `a` instead of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a constant value, and the `reduce` method would return a different value when acting on `1` instead of `b`.

DONE.
