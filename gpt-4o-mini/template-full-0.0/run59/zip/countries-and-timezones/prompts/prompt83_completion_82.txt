Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountryForTimezone(tzName, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getCountryForTimezone` function instead of `getCountry`, potentially returning a different country or null if no country is found for the given timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, { ...options, includeDetails: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the options passed to `getCountry`, adding an `includeDetails` property that may change how the country data is processed or returned, depending on how `getCountry` handles the options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, { ...options, deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `deprecated` option to true, which could alter the returned country data by including deprecated timezones, affecting the output of the function.

DONE.
