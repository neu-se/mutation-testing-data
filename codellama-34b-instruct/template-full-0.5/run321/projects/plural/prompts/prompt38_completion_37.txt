  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|indices/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "index" word, while the replacement code fragment uses the "indices" word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|indexes/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "index" word, while the replacement code fragment uses the "indexes" word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|indices|indexes/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches words that end with "index", while the replacement code fragment matches words that end with "indices" or "indexes".

DONE.
