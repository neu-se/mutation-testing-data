 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, which could cause issues if the original code relies on the array-like behavior of the arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of the enumerable properties of the arguments object, which would not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.callee
```
This would result in different behavior because arguments.callee is a reference to the currently executing function, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
