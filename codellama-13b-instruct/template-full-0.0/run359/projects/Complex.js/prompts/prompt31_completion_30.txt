  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the value of `b` to be doubled, which would affect the result of the `logHypot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the division by 2 would cause the value of `b` to be halved, which would affect the result of the `logHypot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would cause the value of `b` to be increased by 1, which would affect the result of the `logHypot` function.

DONE.
