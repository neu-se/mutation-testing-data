  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for inequality. This means that the new code fragment would not consider `false` to be a valid return value for the `fn` function, and would instead consider any other value, including `undefined`, to be a valid return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for equality. This means that the new code fragment would consider any value that is not strictly equal to `false` to be a valid return value for the `fn` function, while the original code fragment would only consider `false` to be a valid return value.
