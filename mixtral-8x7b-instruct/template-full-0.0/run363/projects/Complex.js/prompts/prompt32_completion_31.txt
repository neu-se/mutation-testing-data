 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if `a` is equal to 0, while this change checks if `a` is greater than 0. This would cause the function to return `Math.log(_b)` when `a` is a positive number, even if `b` is not 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if `a` is equal to 0, while this change divides 1 by `a`. This would cause the function to throw a runtime error (division by zero) when `a` is 0, whereas the original code would continue execution and return `Math.log(_b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.is(a, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition uses the `==` operator
