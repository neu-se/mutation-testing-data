  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'loaded'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would not be emitted, as the `emit` method is called with a different event name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would not be emitted, as the `emit` method is called with a different event name. Additionally, the `data` event would not be emitted either, as the `emit` method is called with the `load` event name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would not be emitted, as the `emit` method is called with a different event name. Additionally, the `end` event would not be emitted either, as the `emit` method is called with the `load` event name.

DONE.
