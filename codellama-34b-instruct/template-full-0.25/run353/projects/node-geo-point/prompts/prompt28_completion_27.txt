  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = deg2rad(point2.latitude) + Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is added to the result of `deg2rad(point2.latitude)`, which would cause the `acos` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = deg2rad(point2.latitude) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of `deg2rad(point2.latitude)` is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `acos` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = deg2rad(point2.latitude) - Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is subtracted from the result of `deg2rad(point2.latitude)`, which would cause the `
