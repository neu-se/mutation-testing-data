  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random()*2) ? Math.sin : Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it randomly selects the sine or cosine function, resulting in a different output for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(1 - a^2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the square root of 1 minus the square of the input, instead of the original square root of 1 plus the square of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI - Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts the sine of the input from pi, instead of multiplying the sine of the input by pi.

DONE.
