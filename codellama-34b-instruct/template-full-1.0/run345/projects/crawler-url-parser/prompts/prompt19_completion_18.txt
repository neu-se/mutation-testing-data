  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `baseUrlStr` to be a HTTPS URL instead of allowing it to be a generic URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://example.com');
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `baseUrlStr` to be a URL with the domain `example.com` instead of allowing it to be a generic URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://$1');
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `baseUrlStr` to be a URL with the protocol `https` instead of allowing it to be a generic URL.

DONE.
