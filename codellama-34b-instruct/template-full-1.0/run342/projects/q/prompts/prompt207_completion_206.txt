  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the check, making it true only if the console is undefined, instead of true if the console is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn === "function123"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the console.warn property is equal to the string "function123", which would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console.warn !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the typeof console.warn is not equal to "function", which would always be true if the console is defined.

DONE.
