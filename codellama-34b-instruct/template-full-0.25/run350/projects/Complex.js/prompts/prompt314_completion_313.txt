  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code fragment `a` refers to the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code fragment `b + 1` refers to the imaginary part plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code fragment `2 * b` refers to twice the imaginary part.

DONE.
