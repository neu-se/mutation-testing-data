  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the resulting direction to be reversed, causing the destination point to be calculated in the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the direction would be doubled, causing the destination point to be calculated twice as far away from the starting point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the direction would be offset by 180 degrees, causing the destination point to be calculated in the opposite direction.

DONE.
