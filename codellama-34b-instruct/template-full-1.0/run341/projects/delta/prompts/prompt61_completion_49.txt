  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null && 
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code checks if the number of object keys in the `attributes` object is greater than 1, instead of greater than 0. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the object has at least one key, which would affect the rest of the code inside that block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null && 
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code checks if the `attributes` object has a `length` property with a value greater than 0, which would not be accurate if the object has keys but no values. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the object has no values, which would affect the rest of the code inside that block.

Option 3: The PL
