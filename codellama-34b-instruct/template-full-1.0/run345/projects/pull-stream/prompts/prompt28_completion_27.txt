  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns a new value to the first element of the `ref` array, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0](0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the first element of the `ref` array as a function with the argument `0`, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the first element of the first element of the `ref` array, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
