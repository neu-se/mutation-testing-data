 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.get(key).toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to convert the value to a string, which may not be possible or desirable for all data types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.get(key) || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an empty object if the key is not found, rather than `undefined`. This could lead to unexpected behavior in code that relies on the distinction between `undefined` and an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.get(key + 'x')
```
This would result in different behavior because it looks up the key with an appended 'x', which will always return `undefined` if the key has not been set. This could lead to unexpected behavior in code that relies on the presence or absence of certain keys.

DONE.
