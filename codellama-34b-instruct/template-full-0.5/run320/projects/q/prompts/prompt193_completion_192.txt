  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3` is an array of two elements, and `attempt3[0]` would only return the first element, which is the filename, while the original code fragment returns both the filename and the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3` is an array of two elements, and `attempt3[1]` would only return the second element, which is the line number, while the original code fragment returns both the filename and the line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3.join(":")
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3` is an array of two elements, and `attempt3.join(":")` would return a string that concatenates both elements with a colon, while the original code fragment returns an array with two elements.
