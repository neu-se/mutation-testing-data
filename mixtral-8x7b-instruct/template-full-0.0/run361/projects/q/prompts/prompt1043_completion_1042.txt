 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the 'get' method to immediately return null instead of waiting for a value to be put into the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the 'get' method to return the entire promise object instead of just the head value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then(function(val) { return val.head; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra layer of promise chaining, causing the 'get' method to return a promise that resolves to the head value instead of the head value itself.

DONE.
