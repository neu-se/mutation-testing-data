  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `hasOwnProperty` method to return `false` for the original key, even if it exists in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `hasOwnProperty` method to return `true` for a different key, even if the original key exists in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, "key"
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be a string, which would cause the `hasOwnProperty` method to return `false` for the original key, even if it exists in the object.

DONE.
