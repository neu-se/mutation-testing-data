  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator changes the value of `op` from the original value to a new value that is one greater.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator changes the value of `op` from the original value to a new value that is twice the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator changes the value of `op` from the original value to a new value that is one less than the original value.

DONE.
