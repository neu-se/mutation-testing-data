  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.reject` is a different function than `when`, and it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.resolve` is a different function than `when`, and it would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.then` is a different function than `when`, and it would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected based on the result of the callback function, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.

DONE.
