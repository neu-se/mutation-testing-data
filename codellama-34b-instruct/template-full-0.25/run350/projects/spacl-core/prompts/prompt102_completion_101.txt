  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `ctx`, which would change the result of the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `ctx` by 2, which would change the result of the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `ctx` would return the length of the string representation of `ctx`, which would change the result of the `query` method.

DONE.
