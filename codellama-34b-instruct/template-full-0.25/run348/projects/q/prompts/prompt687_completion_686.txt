  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `2`, which would include the second argument to `Q.try` in the array of application arguments, whereas the original code fragment would not include the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `0`, which would exclude the second argument to `Q.try` in the array of application arguments, whereas the original code fragment would include it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `arguments.length - 1`, which would include all but the last argument to `Q.try` in the array of application arguments, whereas the original code fragment would include all arguments.

DONE.
