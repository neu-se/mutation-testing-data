  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return offset;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `index`, which is the position of the current operation in the delta, while this replacement returns `offset`, which is the cumulative length of all operations processed so far.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `index`, which is the position of the current operation in the delta, while this replacement returns `length`, which is the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `index`, which is the position of the current operation in the delta, while this replacement returns `0`, which is a constant value that does not depend on the current operation or its position in the delta.

DONE.
