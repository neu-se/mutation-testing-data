  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the bearing to be calculated in the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be calculated as if the destination point was on the opposite side of the globe.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI - Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be calculated as if the destination point was on the opposite side of the globe, but with a different calculation.

DONE.
