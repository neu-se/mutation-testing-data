  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.diff` returns an object describing the differences between two attribute maps, while `AttributeMap.diff(null)` returns `null`, which would cause the rest of the code in the function to error out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff({})
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.diff` returns an object describing the differences between two attribute maps, while `AttributeMap.diff({})` returns an empty object, which would cause the rest of the code in the function to error out.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(new AttributeMap())
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.diff` returns an object describing the differences between two attribute maps, while `AttributeMap.diff(new AttributeMap())` returns an object that contains the same attributes as the original attribute map, which would cause the rest
