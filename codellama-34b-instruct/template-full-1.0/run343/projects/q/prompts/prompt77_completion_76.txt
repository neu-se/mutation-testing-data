  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `flush` would be called with a delay of 1000 ms, whereas in the original code it is called immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `flush` would be called with a negative delay, which would result in `flush` being called immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a different function than `setTimeout`, and it may have different behavior in different environments.

DONE.
