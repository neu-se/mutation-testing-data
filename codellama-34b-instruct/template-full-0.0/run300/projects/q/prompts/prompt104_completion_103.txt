  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `array_reduce` function to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `array_reduce` function to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `array_reduce` function to skip over certain elements in the array.

DONE.
