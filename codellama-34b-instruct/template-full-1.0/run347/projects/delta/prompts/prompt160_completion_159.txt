  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the number 1 into the `delta` array, rather than the expected `Op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push({ foo: 'bar' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert an object with a `foo` property into the `delta` array, rather than the expected `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the next `Op` object from the `otherIter` iterator into the `delta` array, rather than the expected `Op` object.

DONE.
