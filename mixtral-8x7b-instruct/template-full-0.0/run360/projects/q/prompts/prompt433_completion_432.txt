 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable would be set to false, enabling a different code path in the `trackRejection` and `untrackRejection` functions, which could lead to unhandled rejections not being tracked correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable would be set to 0, which would evaluate to false in the conditional statements, enabling a different code path in the `trackRejection` and `untrackRejection` functions, which could lead to unhandled rejections not being tracked correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete trackUnhandledRejections;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable would be deleted, causing the conditional statements in the
