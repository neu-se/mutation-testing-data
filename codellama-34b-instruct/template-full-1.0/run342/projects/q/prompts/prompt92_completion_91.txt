  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(arguments.length <= 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `arguments.length` is greater than 1, which would cause the `reduce` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(arguments.length >= 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `arguments.length` is greater than or equal to 1, which would cause the `reduce` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(arguments.length !== 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `arguments.length` is not equal to 1, which would cause the `reduce` method to return a different result.

DONE.
