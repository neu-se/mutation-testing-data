  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the less than or equal to operator, while this option uses the greater than or equal to operator. This would cause the code to behave differently when the number of in-flight writes is equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the less than or equal to operator, while this option uses the not equal to operator. This would cause the code to behave differently when the number of in-flight writes is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the less than or equal to operator, while this option uses the equal to operator. This would cause the code to behave differently when the number of in-flight writes
