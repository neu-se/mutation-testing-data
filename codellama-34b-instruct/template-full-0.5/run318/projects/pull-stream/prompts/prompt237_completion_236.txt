  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the callback function `cb` is not called when the `end` argument is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the callback function `cb` is not called when the `end` argument is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a falsy value, and the callback function `cb` is not called when the `end` argument is `false`.

DONE.
