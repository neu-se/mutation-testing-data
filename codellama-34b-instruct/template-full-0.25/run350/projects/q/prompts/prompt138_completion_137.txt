  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `hasStacks`, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `hasStacks`, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.
