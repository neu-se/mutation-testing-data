  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(end && false) || true`, which would always be `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(end || false) && true`, which would always be `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator `?:` has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(end ? true : false) && true`, which would always be `true`.

DONE.
