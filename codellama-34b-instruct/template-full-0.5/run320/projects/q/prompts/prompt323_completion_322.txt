  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the third argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the third argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` value would be passed as the third argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
