  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(abort === true ? null : abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `onEnd` function if `abort` is `true`, while this modified code fragment calls it regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(abort === false ? null : abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `onEnd` function if `abort` is `false`, while this modified code fragment calls it regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `onEnd` function if `abort` is `true`, while this modified code fragment calls it regardless of the value of `abort`.

DONE.
