  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.next(opLength)` returns the next `opLength` operations in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(opLength + 1)` would return the next `opLength + 1` operations in the iterator, which would include an extra operation that is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(opLength - 1)` would return the next `opLength - 1` operations in the iterator, which would exclude the last operation that is present in the original code.

DONE.
