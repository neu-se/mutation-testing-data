  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``[](array_slice)``
This would result in different behavior because ``array_slice`` is now a function that takes no arguments and returns an empty array, whereas the original code fragment was a reference to the ``array_slice`` function provided by the Q library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```[<var>]Object.keys(<object>)```
This would result in different behavior because ``Object.keys`` returns an array of property names from an object, whereas the original code fragment was a reference to the ``array_slice`` function provided by the Q library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```[<var>]Array.from(Object.keys(<object>)).slice()```
This would result in different behavior because ``Array.from.Object.keys`` returns an array of property names from an object, and ``slice`` returns a new array that is a subset of the array on which it is called, whereas the original code fragment was a reference to the ``
