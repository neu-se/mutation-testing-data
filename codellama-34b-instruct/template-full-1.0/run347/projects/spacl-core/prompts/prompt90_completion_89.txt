  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let policy
```
This would result in different behavior because `let` declares a block-scoped variable, while `const` declares a constant. In this case, the `for...of` loop iterates over `policies` and sets the `policy` variable to each element in the array. If `let` is used, the `policy` variable is scoped to the `for...of` loop, and its value is reassigned on each iteration. If `const` is used, the `policy` variable is a constant, and its value cannot be reassigned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because `policies[i]` refers to the `i-th` element in the `policies` array, while `policy` refers to the current element in the loop. If `policies[i]` is used, the loop will iterate over the `policies` array and set the `policy` variable to
