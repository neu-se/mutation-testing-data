  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the word instead of the last but one, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra character to the end of the word, which would change the plural form of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the word, which would change the plural form of the word.

DONE.
