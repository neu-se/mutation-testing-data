  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice()` creates a new array, whereas `ref` is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice(1)` creates a new array with the same elements as `ref`, but with the first element removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice(0, -1)` creates a new array with the same elements as `ref`, but with the last element removed.

DONE.
