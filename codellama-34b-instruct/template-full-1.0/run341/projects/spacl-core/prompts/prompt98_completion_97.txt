  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid name for a policy and would cause the `query` method to return `null` regardless of the other arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not a valid name for a policy and would cause the `query` method to return `null` regardless of the other arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unknown'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `PolicyMap` does not have an entry for the `'unknown'` policy, so the `query` method would return `null` when called with this argument, even if the other arguments are valid.

DONE.
