 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exp` method would return a `Complex` object with a `sin` component of 0, regardless of the input's `im` property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exp` method would return a `Complex` object with a `sin` component equal to the `re` property of the input, instead of the `im` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exp` method would return a `Complex` object with a `sin` component equal to a random number between 0 and 1, instead of the `im` property of the input.

DONE.
