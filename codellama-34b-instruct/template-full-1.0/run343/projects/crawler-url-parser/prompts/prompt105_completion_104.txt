  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text => text2
```
This would result in different behavior because `text` and `text2` are different strings and would produce different results depending on the context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `text` would be null and would not produce any output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text = 'URL'
```
This would result in different behavior because `text` would be the string 'URL' and would produce a different output depending on the context.

DONE.
