  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first character of the part instead of the entire part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the part instead of the part itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the part in reverse order instead of the original order.

DONE.
