 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `_flush` method to proceed even when there are more inflight writes than expected, potentially causing data inconsistencies.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require the `_inFlightWrites` counter to be exactly -1, which is unlikely to occur, causing the `_flush` method to never proceed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, causing the `_flush` method to proceed regardless of the number of inflight writes, potentially causing data inconsistencies.

DONE.
