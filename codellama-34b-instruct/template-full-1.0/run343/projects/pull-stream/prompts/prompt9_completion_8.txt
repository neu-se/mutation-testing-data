  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```var k in throughs```
This would result in different behavior because `throughs` is a different object than `sinks`, and the loop would iterate over different key-value pairs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```var k in exports```
This would result in different behavior because `exports` is a different object than `sinks`, and the loop would iterate over different key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```for(var k in sources)```
This would result in different behavior because `sources` is a different object than `sinks`, and the loop would iterate over different key-value pairs.

DONE.
