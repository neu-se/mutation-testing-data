 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10 * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `floor` method would now be using a different value to calculate the result, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ** 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `floor` method would now be using exponentiation instead of multiplication to calculate the value of `places`, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(Math.log(places) * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `floor` method would now be using a more complex calculation to determine the value of `places`, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
