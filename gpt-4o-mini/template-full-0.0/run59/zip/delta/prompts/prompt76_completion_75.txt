Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = { ...newOp, insert: null };
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `insert` property of `newOp` to `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior when the `insert` operation is processed, potentially causing errors or incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = { ...newOp, delete: 1 };
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a `delete` property with a value of `1` to `newOp`, which changes the operation from an insert to a delete, altering the intended operation and potentially leading to data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = { ...newOp, retain: newOp.retain + 1 };
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `retain` property of `newOp` by incrementing it by `1`, which could lead to incorrect retention behavior and affect the overall operation sequence in the `ops` array.

DONE.
