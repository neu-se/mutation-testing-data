  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that reads the entire contents of a file into memory, whereas `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that reads the contents of a file asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(fs)` is a bound function that is bound to the `fs` object, whereas `fs.readFile` is an unbound function that is not bound to any object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(null)` is a bound function that is bound to `null`, whereas `fs.readFile` is an unbound function that is not bound to any object.

DONE.
