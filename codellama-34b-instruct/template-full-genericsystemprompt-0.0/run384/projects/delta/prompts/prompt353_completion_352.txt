  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is not defined on the `inverted` object, and would therefore throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new `Delta` object that is a copy of the original `inverted` object, but with the last operation removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the first operation from the `inverted` object, and would therefore change the resulting delta.

DONE.
