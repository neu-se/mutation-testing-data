  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.matches(path, ctx) && verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `this.matches(path, ctx)`, causing the condition to always evaluate to `false` even if the path matches the rule and the verb is allowed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) && verb in this.verbs && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& false` would cause the condition to always evaluate to `false`, even if the path matches the rule and the verb is allowed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) && verb in this.verbs && this.regex.test(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `this.regex.test(path)` would cause the condition to also check if the path matches the rule's regular expression, even if
