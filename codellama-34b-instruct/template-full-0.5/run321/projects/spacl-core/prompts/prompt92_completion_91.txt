  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of this.policies)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the `PolicyMap` class, whereas the original code fragment did not use `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of the `policies` array starting from the second element, whereas the original code fragment iterated over the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.filter((p) => p.name !== 'admin'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array containing only the policies with a name that is not equal to 'admin', whereas the original code fragment iterated over all policies.

DONE.
