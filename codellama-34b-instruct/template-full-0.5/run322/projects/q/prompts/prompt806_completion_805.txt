  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is not called in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply()` method is not called on the `callback` function in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call()` method is not called on the `callback` function in the original code.

DONE.
