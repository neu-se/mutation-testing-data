  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'end'` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, which is not the same as the `'error'` event that is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'close'` event is emitted when the read stream is closed, which is not the same as the `'error'` event that is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'drain'` event is emitted when the write stream is drained, which is not the same as the `'error'` event that is emitted when an error occurs.

DONE.
