  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the newline character from '\n' to '\r\n', which is a different newline character sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the newline character from '\n' to '\r', which is a different newline character sequence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the newline character from '\n' to a space character, which would cause the code to behave differently when it encounters a space character.

DONE.
