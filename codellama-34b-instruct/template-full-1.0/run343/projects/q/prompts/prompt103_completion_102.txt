  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this[index]` is used to get the value at a certain index in an array, while the modified code fragment `this[i] = undefined;` is used to set the value at a certain index in an array to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this[index]` is used to get the value at a certain index in an array, while the modified code fragment `this[i] + 1;` is used to add 1 to the value at a certain index in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i].method();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this[index]` is used to get the value at a certain index in an array, while the modified code fragment `this[i].
