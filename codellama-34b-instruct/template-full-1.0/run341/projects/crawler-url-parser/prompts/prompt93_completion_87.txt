  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would not be called, and the `currentUrl` variable would be assigned the value `null`, causing the function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    "this is a new string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with a string argument, but the function expects a URL string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    +
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `.` operator to concatenate the strings, causing a different result to be returned.

DONE.
