  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is not `true`.

DONE.
