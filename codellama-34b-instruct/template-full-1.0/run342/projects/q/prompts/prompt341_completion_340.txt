  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise` is a resolved promise, while `defer` is a deferred object that needs to be resolved or rejected using `defer.resolve` or `defer.reject` respectively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` resolves the promise with the value passed as an argument, but `deferred.promise` is the promise that needs to be resolved in the first place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` rejects the promise with the value passed as an argument, but `deferred.promise` is the promise that needs to be resolved in the first place.

DONE.
