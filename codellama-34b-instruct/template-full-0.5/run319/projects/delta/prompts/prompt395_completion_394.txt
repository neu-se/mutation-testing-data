  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a number, and `thisOp.delete` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is an object, and `thisOp.delete` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.attributes` is an object, and `thisOp.delete` is a number.

DONE.
