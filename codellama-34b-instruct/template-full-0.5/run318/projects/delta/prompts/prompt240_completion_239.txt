  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the this iterator, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the delete property of the current operation instead of the length of the other iterator, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the delete property of the other operation instead of the length of the other iterator, which could lead to incorrect results in the diff function.

DONE.
