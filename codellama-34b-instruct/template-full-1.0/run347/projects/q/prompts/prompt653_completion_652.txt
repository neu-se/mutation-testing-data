  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send" [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapply` method is expected to accept a variadic number of arguments, but the replacement code only accepts a single `name` argument and an array of `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fapply" [array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fapply` method is expected to accept a variadic number of arguments, but the replacement code only accepts a single `array_slice(arguments, 2)` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__noSuchMethod__" [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `__noSuchMethod__` method is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would result in a `ReferenceError` being thrown.

DONE.
