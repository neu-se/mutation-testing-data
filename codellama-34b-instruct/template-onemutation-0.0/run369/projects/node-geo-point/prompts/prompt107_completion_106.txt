  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the square root of 2, which is an irrational number, while the new code fragment is using the cube root of 2, which is a rational number. This change in behavior would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be incorrect, leading to a different result.

DONE.
