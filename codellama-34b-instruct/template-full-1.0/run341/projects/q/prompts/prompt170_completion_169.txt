  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be offset by one line, potentially altering the logic of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be offset by one line, potentially altering the logic of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be offset by twice the line number, potentially altering the logic of the program.

DONE.
