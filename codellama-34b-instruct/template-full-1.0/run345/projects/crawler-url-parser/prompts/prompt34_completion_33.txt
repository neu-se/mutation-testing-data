  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with the `decode` argument set to `false`, which would not decode special characters in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with the `parseOnly` argument set to `false`, which would not parse the URL according to the server-side implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with both `decode` and `parseOnly` arguments set to `true`, which would result in a different parsing of the URL.

DONE.
