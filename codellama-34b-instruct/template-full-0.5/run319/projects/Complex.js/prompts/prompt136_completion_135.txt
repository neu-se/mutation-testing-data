  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `this['isInfinite']`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `this['isInfinite']` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isFinite']` would check if the number is finite, while `this['isInfinite']` checks if the number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isNaN']` would check if the number is Not-a-Number, while `this['isInfinite']` checks if the number is infinite.

DONE.
