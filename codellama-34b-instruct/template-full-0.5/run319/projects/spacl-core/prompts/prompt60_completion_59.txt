  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function is not called, and the resulting regular expression would not match the expected input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is not called, and the resulting regular expression would not match the expected input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not anchored to the beginning of the string, and the resulting regular expression would not match the expected input.

DONE.
