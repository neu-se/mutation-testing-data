  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the "head" property of the promise, rather than the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the "tail" property of the promise, rather than the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head").get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the "tail" property of the promise returned by the "head" property, rather than the promise itself.

DONE.
