  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isEncoding(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Buffer.isEncoding()` checks if the provided content is a valid encoding, while `Buffer.isBuffer()` checks if the provided content is a buffer instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, and `Buffer.isBuffer()` returns a boolean value. So, the negation of the result would be the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof content !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of the operand. In this case, it would return "string" if the content is not a string, which would be different from the original behavior.

DONE.
