  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` and `cosh` are different functions. `cos` is the cosine function, which calculates the cosine of an angle, while `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function, which calculates the hyperbolic cosine of an angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are different functions. `sin` is the sine function, which calculates the sine of an angle, while `cos` is the cosine function, which calculates the cosine of an angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `cosh` are different functions. `tan` is the tangent function, which calculates the tangent of an angle, while `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function, which calculates the hyper
