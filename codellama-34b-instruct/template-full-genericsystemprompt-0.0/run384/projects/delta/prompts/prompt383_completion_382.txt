  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of two numbers, while `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + length
```
This would result in different behavior because `offset + length` would always be greater than `index`, causing the `while` loop to run indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - length
```
This would result in different behavior because `index - length` would always be less than `offset`, causing the `while` loop to run indefinitely.

DONE.
