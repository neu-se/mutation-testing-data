 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(policy) => policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns an array containing the policy name and the policy object, while this modification only returns the policy name. This could cause issues if the rest of the codebase expects an array with two elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(policy) => ({ name: policy.name, policy: policy })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns an array containing the policy name and the policy object, while this modification returns an object with two properties, which could cause issues if the rest of the codebase expects an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(policy) => [policy.name, policy, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns an array containing the policy name and the policy object, while this modification returns an array with three elements, including the policy name twice.
