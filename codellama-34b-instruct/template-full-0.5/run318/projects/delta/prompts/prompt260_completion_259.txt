  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert + otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the two insert operations, potentially resulting in a different resulting document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert - otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the two insert operations, potentially resulting in a negative value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert - thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the two insert operations in the opposite order, potentially resulting in a different resulting document.

DONE.
