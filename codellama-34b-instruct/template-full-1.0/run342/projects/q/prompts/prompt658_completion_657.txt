  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index] = promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would not be called on the value of `promise`, potentially causing the promise to never settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, index);
```
This would result in different behavior because the array of arguments passed to the `Q.dispatch` method would start from the current `index` instead of from the beginning of the `arguments` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index + 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `promise` would be replaced with the next value in the `promises` array, potentially causing the wrong promise to be settled.

DONE.
