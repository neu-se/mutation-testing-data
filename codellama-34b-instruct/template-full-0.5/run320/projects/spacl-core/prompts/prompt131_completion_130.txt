  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined && match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the original code used the `===` operator to check for strict equality. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `prop` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the original code used the `===` operator to check for strict equality. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `prop` is not `undefined`.
