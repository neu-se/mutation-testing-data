  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, decodedBasename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the `options.dest` directory with the `decodedBasename` string, which is not the same as joining the `options.dest` directory with the `dest` directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, basename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the `options.dest` directory with the `basename` string, which is not the same as joining the `options.dest` directory with the `dest` directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, path.basename(options.dest));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the `options.dest` directory with the `path.basename(options.dest)` string, which is not the
