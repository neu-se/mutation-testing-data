  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.indexOf(newline, start);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for the first occurrence of the newline character after the start position, whereas the original code was searching for the last occurrence of the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.indexOf(newline, start, end);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for the first occurrence of the newline character between the start and end positions, whereas the original code was searching for the last occurrence of the newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.lastIndexOf(newline, start);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for the last occurrence of the newline character after the start position, whereas the original code was searching for the first occurrence of the newline character.

DONE.
