  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not take into account the singular form of the word, i.e. "goose".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geesee'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra "e" to the end of the word, which is not the correct plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geesev'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a random letter "v" to the end of the word, which is not the correct plural form.

DONE.
