 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function would immediately resolve the returned promise with an empty array, instead of waiting for all the input promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Placeholder error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function would immediately reject the returned promise with an error, instead of waiting for all the input promises to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (promise) {
  return promise;
}
