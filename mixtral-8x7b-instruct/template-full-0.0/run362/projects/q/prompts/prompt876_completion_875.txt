 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Array global's slice method instead of the utility module's array\_slice. It may not handle arguments that are not arrays correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.slice
