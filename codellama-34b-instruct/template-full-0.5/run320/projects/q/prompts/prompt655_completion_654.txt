  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises[index]` is a different value than `object`, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[promises.length - 1 - index]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the `promises` array, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the current element in the `promises` array, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
