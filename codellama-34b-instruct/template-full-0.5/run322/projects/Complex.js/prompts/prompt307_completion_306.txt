  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is not equivalent to the `cosh` function. The `sinh` function calculates the hyperbolic sine of a number, whereas the `cosh` function calculates the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function is not equivalent to the `cosh` function. The `tanh` function calculates the hyperbolic tangent of a number, whereas the `cosh` function calculates the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coth
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coth` function is not equivalent to the `cosh` function. The `coth` function calculates the hyperbolic cotangent of a number, whereas the `cosh` function calculates the hyperbolic cosine.
