  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick();
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that schedules the `flush` function to be called later, but calling it directly would cause `flush` to be called immediately, which could cause unintended side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.call(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that schedules the `flush` function to be called later, but calling it with `call(null)` would cause `flush` to be called immediately with the global object as the `this` value, which could cause unintended side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.apply(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that schedules the `flush` function to be called later, but calling it with `apply(null)` would cause `flush` to be called
