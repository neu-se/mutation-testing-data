Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the first operation in `other.ops`, potentially leading to an incorrect concatenation of operations, as it would not skip the first operation as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two operations in `other.ops`, which may lead to missing important operations that should be included in the concatenated result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.concat(this.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the entire `this.ops` array to `other.ops`, rather than just appending the remaining operations from `other.ops`, which could lead to an incorrect and unintended combination of operations.

DONE.
