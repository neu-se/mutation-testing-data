  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the iter.next() method is called with a different argument, `index + 1`, which would cause the iterator to advance by one step more than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the iter.next() method is called with a different argument, `index * 2`, which would cause the iterator to advance by a factor of 2 more than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the iter.next() method is called with the same argument, `index`, as the original code. However, if the iterator's state has been modified between the two calls, the behavior of the iter.next() method may be different.

DONE.
