  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, while this new code fragment checks if it's a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is a string, as the new code fragment would evaluate to `true` in that case, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, while this new code fragment checks if it's an object. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is an object, as the new code fragment would evaluate to `true` in that case, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
