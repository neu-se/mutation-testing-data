  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join` is used to join two paths together, while `path.resolve` is used to resolve a path relative to the current working directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, while `path.resolve` returns the resolved path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the base name of a path, while `path.resolve` returns the resolved path.

DONE.
