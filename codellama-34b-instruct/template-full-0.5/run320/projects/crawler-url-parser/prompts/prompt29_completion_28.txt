  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the string to lowercase, which could cause the regular expression in the `URL.parse()` method to not match the expected format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would remove the first character of the string, which could cause the regular expression in the `URL.parse()` method to not match the expected format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/\./g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove all periods from the string, which could cause the regular expression in the `URL.parse()` method to not match the expected format.

DONE.
