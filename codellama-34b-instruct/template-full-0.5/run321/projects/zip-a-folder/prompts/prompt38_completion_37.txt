  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always execute the `else` block, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always execute the `if` block, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always execute the `else` block, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
