Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var key in object) { if (object[key] === undefined) continue; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips keys with `undefined` values, which means not all properties of the object will be considered, potentially leading to missing keys in the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var key in object) { if (key === 'length') continue; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly skips the `length` property of the object, which may lead to an incomplete list of keys if the object has a `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var key in object) { if (!object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)) continue; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property is an own property of the object, which would exclude inherited properties from being included in the keys array, potentially changing the expected output.

DONE.
