 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * deg2rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an unnecessary multiplication operation, which would not affect the calculation result but could potentially cause issues if the multiplication operator has a different precedence in the codebase or if it's overloaded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(Math.sin(coordinate.latitude) * Math.cos(distance / radius) + Math.cos(coordinate.latitude) * Math.sin(distance / radius) * Math.cos(Î¸))
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calculates the destination latitude using the haversine formula, bypassing the original method `deg2rad(point2.latitude)`. This could lead to incorrect results if the input `coordinate.latitude` is not already in radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(Math.sin(
