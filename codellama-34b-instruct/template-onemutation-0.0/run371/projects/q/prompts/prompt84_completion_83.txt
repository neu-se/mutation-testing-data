  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestPortTick` is a function that posts a message to the message channel, whereas `requestTick` is a function that sets a timeout to flush the queue. Using `requestPortTick` instead of `requestTick` would cause the queue to be flushed more frequently, which could lead to different behavior in the program.
