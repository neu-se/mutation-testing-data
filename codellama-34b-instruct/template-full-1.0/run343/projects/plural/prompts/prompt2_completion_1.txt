  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
6
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would start at the 6th index instead of the 8th, which would result in a different substring being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would end after the 10th index instead of the 8th, which would result in a different substring being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would start 2 indices from the end of the string instead of starting at the 8th index, which would result in a different substring being returned.

DONE.
