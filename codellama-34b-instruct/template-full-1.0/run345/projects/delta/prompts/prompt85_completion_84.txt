  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function would return `true` for `null` and any other object, including `newOp.attributes`, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function would return `false` for `undefined` and any other object, including `newOp.attributes`, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function would return `true` for an empty object and `newOp.attributes`, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
