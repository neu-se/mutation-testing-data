  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively do nothing, as `resolvedPromise` is already the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the resolved value, potentially causing the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, potentially causing the promise to be fulfilled with the value `1`.

DONE.
