  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `d` is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `c` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `a` is equal to 0.

DONE.
