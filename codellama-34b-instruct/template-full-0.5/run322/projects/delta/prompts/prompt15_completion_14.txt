  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, while this code checks if `a` is null. If `a` is null, the original code would return `b`, while this code would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, while this code checks if `a` is not equal to itself. This would always return `undefined`, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, while this code checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, the original code would return `b`, while this code would return `undefined`.

DONE.
