  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the second key in the `otherData` object, rather than the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `embedType` is not equal to the first key in the `otherData` object, rather than checking if it is equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0] && otherData[embedType] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `embedType` is equal to the first key in the `otherData` object and if the value associated with that key is not null, rather than just checking if the `embedType` is equal to the first key.

DONE.
