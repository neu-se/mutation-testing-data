  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with a specific `this` value and zero or more arguments, whereas the original code fragment uses the `makeNodeResolver` method without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method calls a function with a specific `this` value and arguments, whereas the original code fragment uses the `makeNodeResolver` method without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method calls a function with a specific `this` value and an array of arguments, whereas the original code fragment uses the `makeNodeResolver` method without any arguments.

DONE.
