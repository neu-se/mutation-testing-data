  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` method expects an object, but `obj.length` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj[Math.random() * 10]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` method expects a fixed reference to the object, but `obj[Math.random() * 10]` creates a new reference to a random property of the object each time it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj[ Symbol('buggy') ]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` method expects a fixed reference to the object, but `obj[Symbol('buggy')]` creates a new reference to a property of the object with the name 'buggy', which is unlikely to be present in the original object.

DONE.
