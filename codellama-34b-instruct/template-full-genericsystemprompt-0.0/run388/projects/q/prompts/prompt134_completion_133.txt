  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for strict equality with `value`, while this modified code fragment checks for strict equality with `value + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for strict equality with `value`, while this modified code fragment checks for strict equality with `value * 2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for strict equality with `value`, while this modified code fragment checks for strict equality with `value - 1`.

DONE.
