  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.domain` and `pageurl.domain` would not be equal, even if the domains are the same, causing the function to return "external" instead of "internal".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.subdomain != pageurl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.subdomain` and `pageurl.subdomain` would not be equal, even if the subdomains are the same, causing the function to return "internal" instead of "samelevel".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.tld != pageurl.tld
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.tld` and `pageurl.tld` would not be equal, even if the TLDs are the same, causing the function to return "internal" instead of "subdomain".
