 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfilled.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` uses the provided `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` uses the provided `this` value and an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfilled.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to the provided value and pre-filled arguments, if any. In this case, it would lose the original `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(fulfilled, array) => fulfilled(...array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an arrow function with the spread operator to pass the array elements as separate arguments, which changes the behavior compared to the original `apply` function.

DONE.
