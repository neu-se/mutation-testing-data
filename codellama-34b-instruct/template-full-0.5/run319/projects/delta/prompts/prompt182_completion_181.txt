  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would always return the first element of the array, regardless of the index passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would always return the last element of the array, regardless of the index passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would always return the middle element of the array, regardless of the index passed as an argument.

DONE.
