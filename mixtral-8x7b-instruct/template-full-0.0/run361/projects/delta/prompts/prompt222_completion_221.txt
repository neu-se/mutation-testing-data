 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is used instead of the first string, causing the `diff()` function to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second string is used instead of the first string, causing the `diff()` function to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
strings[Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because a random string is chosen between the first and second string, causing the `diff()` function to produce different results depending on the randomly selected string.

DONE.
