  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `busy` variable is always true when the `map` function is called, so the `abortCb` function would never be called, even if the `abort` signal is received.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `busy` variable is always false when the `map` function is called, so the `abortCb` function would always be called, even if the `abort` signal is not received.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable is always false when the `map` function is called, so the `abortCb` function would never be called, even if the `abort` signal is received.

DONE.
