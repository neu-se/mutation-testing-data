  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (; index < length; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run indefinitely, causing a stack overflow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (; index < length; index--) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run in reverse, causing the array to be traversed in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (; index > length; index--) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition `index > length` would never be true.

DONE.
