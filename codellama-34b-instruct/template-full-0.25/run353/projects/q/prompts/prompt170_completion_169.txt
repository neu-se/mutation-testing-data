  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.includes("node_modules")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the line includes the string "node_modules", which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.startsWith("node_modules")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the line starts with the string "node_modules", which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.endsWith("node_modules")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the line ends with the string "node_modules", which is not present in the original code fragment.

DONE.
