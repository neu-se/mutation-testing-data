  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` will immediately close the write stream, potentially causing data loss and inconsistencies in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` will cause the write stream to close after all data has been flushed, but it will not destroy the stream, potentially causing inconsistencies in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.emit('error', new Error('Test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate an error in the write stream, potentially causing the database to enter an inconsistent state.

DONE.
