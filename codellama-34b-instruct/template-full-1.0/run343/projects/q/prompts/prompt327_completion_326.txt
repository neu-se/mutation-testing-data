  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to return a rejected promise, rather than a resolved promise as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to return a resolved promise, rather than a rejected promise as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error('Buggy code'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to reject the promise, rather than resolved or rejected as expected.

DONE.
