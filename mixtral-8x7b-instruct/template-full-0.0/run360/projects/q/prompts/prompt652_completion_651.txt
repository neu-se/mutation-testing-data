 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[name, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Array.prototype.slice` method instead of the `array_slice` function, which may have different behavior or not be defined in the current context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[name, arguments]
