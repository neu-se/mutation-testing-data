  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last element from the `ops` array, regardless of whether it has an `insert` or `retain` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length - 1).delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `delete` property of the last element in `ops` instead of removing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length - 1, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from `ops` and return a new array with the removed element included.

DONE.
