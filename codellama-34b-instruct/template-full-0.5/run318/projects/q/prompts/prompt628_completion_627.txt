  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument would be passed to the `set` method, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` argument would be `undefined`, which could cause the `set` method to behave differently, such as setting the property to `undefined` instead of the intended value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` argument would be `null`, which could cause the `set` method to behave differently, such as setting the property to `null` instead of the intended value.

DONE.
