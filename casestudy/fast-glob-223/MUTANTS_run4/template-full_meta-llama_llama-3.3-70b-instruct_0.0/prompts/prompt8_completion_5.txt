Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ESCAPE_SYMBOL + ESCAPE_SYMBOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of two consecutive escape symbols instead of a single one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
GLOBSTAR
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of the globstar pattern instead of the escape symbol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of an empty string instead of the escape symbol, which would always return true and consider all patterns as dynamic.

DONE.
