 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `runSingle` function expects a task (function) as the second argument, but it would receive `null` instead. This would likely cause an error when invoking `runSingle`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `runSingle` function expects a task (function) as the second argument, but it would receive an integer instead. This would likely cause an error when invoking `runSingle`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `runSingle` function expects a task (function) as the second argument, but it would receive a string instead. This would likely cause an error when invoking `runSingle`.

DONE.
