  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const λ2 = λ1 + (y / x) * (180 / Math.PI);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `atan2(y, x)`, which is a function that calculates the arc tangent of y/x, whereas the replaced code calculates the quotient of y/x and multiplies it by 180/π. This would cause the calculations of longitude and latitude to be incorrect and may introduce errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const λ2 = λ1 + (y / x) * (180 / Math.PI) + 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code did not have the +180 part, which would cause the calculated longitude to be off by 180 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const λ2 = λ1 - (y / x) *
