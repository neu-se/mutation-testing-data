  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `attr` method to get the value of the `href` attribute, but the new code fragment is using the `attr` method to set the value of the `href` attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `attr` method to get the value of the `href` attribute, but the new code fragment is using the `prop` method to get the value of the `href` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').data('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `attr` method to get the value of the `href` attribute, but the new code fragment is using the `data` method to get the value of the `href` data attribute.
