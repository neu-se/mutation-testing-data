  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `abortCb` if `busy` is true, but this new code fragment calls it regardless of the value of `busy`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `abortCb` with `aborted` as an argument, but this new code fragment calls it with `err` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes an argument to `abortCb`, but this new code fragment does not.

DONE.
