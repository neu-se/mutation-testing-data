  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is checking for a different pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is checking for a different pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is checking for a different pattern.

DONE.
