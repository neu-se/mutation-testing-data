  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function, whereas `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, whereas `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coth
```
This would result in different behavior because `coth` is the hyperbolic cotangent function, whereas `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function.

DONE.
