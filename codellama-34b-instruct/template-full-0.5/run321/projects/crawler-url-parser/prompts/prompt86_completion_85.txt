  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the element, rather than the trimmed text content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the href attribute of the element, rather than the trimmed text content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().split(' ').join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the element with all spaces removed, rather than the trimmed text content.

DONE.
