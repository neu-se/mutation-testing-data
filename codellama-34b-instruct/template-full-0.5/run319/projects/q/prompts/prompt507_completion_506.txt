  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` and `args` variables are not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object, whereas `value` refers to the function's `this` binding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object and does not have a `post` method.

DONE.
