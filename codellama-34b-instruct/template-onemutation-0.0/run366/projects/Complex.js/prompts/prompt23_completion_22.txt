  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than `b`, while the modified code fragment checks if `a` is greater than `b`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `a` is less than `b`, and `true` when `a` is greater than `b`, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
