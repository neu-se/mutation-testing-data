  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a length of 0, which would not advance the iterator and would not return any ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a length of -1, which would return the previous op instead of the next one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a length of Infinity, which would return all remaining ops in the iterator.

DONE.
