 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be immediately invoked without waiting for the data to be persisted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setImmediate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be scheduled to run in the next iteration of the event loop, instead of being called directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.get(key).push(cb.bind(this))
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be bound to the `this` context of the `Dirty` instance, which might cause unexpected behavior if the callback relies on the `this` value.

DONE.
