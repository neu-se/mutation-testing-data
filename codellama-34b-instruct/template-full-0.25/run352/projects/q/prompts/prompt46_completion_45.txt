  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit()` would cause the process to terminate immediately, whereas the original code would continue executing the rest of the code in the event loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit(1)` would cause the process to terminate with an error code of 1, whereas the original code would continue executing the rest of the code in the event loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit(0)` would cause the process to terminate with a success code of 0, whereas the original code would continue executing the rest of the code in the event loop.

DONE.
