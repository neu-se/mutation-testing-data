  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's', rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return a plural form of the word, regardless of the number provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + word, rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return a plural form of the word, concatenated with the original word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase(), rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the plural form of the word in uppercase.

DONE.
