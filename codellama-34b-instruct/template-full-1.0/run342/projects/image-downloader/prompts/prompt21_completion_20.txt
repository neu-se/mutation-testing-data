  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url` is a different variable than `options.dest`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url` is a different variable than `options.dest`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url` is a different variable than `options.dest`.

DONE.
