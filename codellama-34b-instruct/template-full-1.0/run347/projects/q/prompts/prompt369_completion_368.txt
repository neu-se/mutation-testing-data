  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, instead of the `exception` object. The `reject` function would then throw a `TypeError`, causing the promise to be rejected with that error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with the message property of the `exception` object, instead of the object itself. The `reject` function would then throw a `TypeError`, causing the promise to be rejected with that error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{message: exception.message}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with an object with a `message` property that contains the message of the `exception` object, instead of the object itself. The `reject` function would then throw a `TypeError`, causing
