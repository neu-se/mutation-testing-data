  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array with the elements from the start index (inclusive) to the end index (exclusive), while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` returns a new array with the elements in the opposite order, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

DONE.
