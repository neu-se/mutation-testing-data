  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is undefined, and `this._data.set()` would be called with `undefined` as the key, which is not allowed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key + 1` is a different key than `row.key`, and `this._data.set()` would be called with a different key than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key.toLowerCase()` is a different key than `row.key`, and `this._data.set()` would be called with a different key than the original code.

DONE.
