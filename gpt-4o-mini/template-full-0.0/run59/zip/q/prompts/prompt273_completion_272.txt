Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener("error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends a fixed string "error" to the progress listener instead of the actual progress value, which may lead to incorrect handling of progress updates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` to the progress listener, which may not be handled correctly by the listener and could lead to unexpected results or errors in the progress reporting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener(operands[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `operands[0]` instead of the intended `progress`, potentially leading to incorrect or irrelevant data being sent to the progress listener, which may not represent the actual progress of the operation.

DONE.
