  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise instead of resolving it, which would cause the promise chain to fail instead of succeeding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise of progress instead of resolving it, which would cause the promise chain to continue but not complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.cancel
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.cancel` would cancel the promise instead of resolving it, which would cause the promise chain to fail instead of succeeding.

DONE.
