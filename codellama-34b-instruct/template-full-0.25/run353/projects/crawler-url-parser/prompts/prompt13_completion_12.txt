  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this code fragment replaces it with "https://", which could cause issues if the website is not configured to use SSL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this code fragment replaces it with "ftp://", which could cause issues if the website is not configured to use FTP.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this code fragment replaces it with "file://", which could cause issues if the website is not configured to use the file protocol.

DONE.
