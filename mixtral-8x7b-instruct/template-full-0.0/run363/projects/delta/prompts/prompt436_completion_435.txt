 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.delete !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator has changed from `typeof` (which checks the type of a variable) to `!==` (which checks for strict inequality). This change would cause the condition to always evaluate to `true` if `nextOp.delete` is defined (as `undefined` is a falsy value in JavaScript), even if it's not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.hasOwnProperty('delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `nextOp` object has a property named `delete`, rather than checking the type of the `delete` property. This change would cause the condition to evaluate to `true` if the `nextOp` object has a property named `delete`, regardless of its value or type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(nextOp, 'delete')
