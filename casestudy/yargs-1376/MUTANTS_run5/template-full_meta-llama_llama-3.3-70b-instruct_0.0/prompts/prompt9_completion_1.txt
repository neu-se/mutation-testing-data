Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `config.hasOwnProperty` is a function and needs to be called with the property name as an argument, whereas `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` is a static method that can be used directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.extends!== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `extends` property is not undefined, but does not verify if it is the object's own property, which could lead to incorrect results if the property is inherited.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.in === 'extends'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string 'extends' is a property of the `config` object using the `in` operator, but the syntax is incorrect and would cause a syntax error, and even if it was correct, it would not achieve the same result as the original code.

DONE.
