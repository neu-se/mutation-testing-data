 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` creates a new rejected promise, which might not be handled correctly in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Rejected'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new error object, which might have different properties than the original error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a new rejected promise using the `Q` library, which might not be handled correctly in the test suite.

DONE.
