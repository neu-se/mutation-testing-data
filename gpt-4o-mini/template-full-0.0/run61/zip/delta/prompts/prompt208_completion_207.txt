Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `delta` object without calling the `chop()` method, potentially leaving the `delta` in an unoptimized state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.concat(new Delta());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate an empty `Delta` to the `delta`, which may alter the final structure of the returned `Delta` compared to the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.delete(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove one operation from the `delta`, which could lead to loss of data or incorrect representation of the operations that were supposed to be included in the final result.

DONE.
