  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` is a different method than `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.prototype.fapply` is a different method than `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fbind` is a different method than `Q`.

DONE.
