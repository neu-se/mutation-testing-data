  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `Complex['NAN']`, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a, b);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a new `Complex` object with the same `a` and `b` values, regardless of the input values.

DONE.
