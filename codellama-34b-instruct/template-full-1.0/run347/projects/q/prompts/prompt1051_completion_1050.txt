  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end 
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would never resolve the promise and would never return the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = Q.reject(Error("Can't get value from closed queue"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tial` variable is never updated and the `get` method would always return the same error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(Q.reject(Error("Can't get value from closed queue"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `put` method would never resolve the promise and would never add the value to the queue.

DONE.
