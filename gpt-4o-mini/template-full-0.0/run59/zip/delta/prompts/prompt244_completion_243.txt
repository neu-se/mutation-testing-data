Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it always deletes a fixed length of 1, regardless of the actual length of the operation, potentially leading to incorrect deletions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(opLength + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete one more operation than intended, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or unintended deletion of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively does nothing (deletes 0 operations), which could cause the logic to skip necessary deletions and result in an incorrect delta.

DONE.
