  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is now checking whether the length of the line is negative, which is not a valid or meaningful condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.isEmpty()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is now checking whether the line is empty, which is a different condition than checking whether the length of the line is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is now checking whether the line is null, which is a different condition than checking whether the length of the line is zero.

DONE.
