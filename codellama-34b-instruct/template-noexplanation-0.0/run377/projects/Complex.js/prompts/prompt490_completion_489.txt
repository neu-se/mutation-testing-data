  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': false }
```
This change will cause the `Complex` object to be exported with a different value for the `__esModule` property, which may cause issues with the module loading process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': null }
```
This change will cause the `Complex` object to be exported with a null value for the `__esModule` property, which may cause issues with the module loading process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': undefined }
```
This change will cause the `Complex` object to be exported with an undefined value for the `__esModule` property, which may cause issues with the module loading process.

DONE.
