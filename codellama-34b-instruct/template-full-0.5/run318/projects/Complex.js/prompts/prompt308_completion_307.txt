  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * b` was multiplying the value of `b` by 2, whereas the replacement code fragment `2 * a` would multiply the value of `a` by 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * b` was multiplying the value of `b` by 2, whereas the replacement code fragment `b * b` would multiply the value of `b` by itself, resulting in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * b` was multiplying the value of `b` by 2, whereas the replacement code fragment `a + b` would add the value of `a` and `b`, resulting in a different value.

DONE.
