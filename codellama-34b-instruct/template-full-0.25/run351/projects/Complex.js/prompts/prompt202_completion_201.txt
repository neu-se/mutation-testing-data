  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not used in the original code fragment, and the `z['re']` variable is used in the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is used in the `if` statement, and the `z['im']` variable is not used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not used in the original code fragment, and the `z['im']` variable is used in the `if` statement.

DONE.
