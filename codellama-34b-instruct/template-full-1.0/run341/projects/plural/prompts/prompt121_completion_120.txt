  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is missing, which would cause the regular expression to be case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is now case-insensitive, which would cause the regular expression to match words with uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is now case-insensitive, which would cause the regular expression to match words with uppercase letters.

DONE.
