  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is an array, and `args.length` would return the length of the array, rather than the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0]` would return the first element of the `args` array, rather than the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, and would cause an error when trying to access its elements.

DONE.
