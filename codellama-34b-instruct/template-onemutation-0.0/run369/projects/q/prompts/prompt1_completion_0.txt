  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `bootstrap` is a function, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not a function. This change would cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to different behavior or errors.

DONE.
