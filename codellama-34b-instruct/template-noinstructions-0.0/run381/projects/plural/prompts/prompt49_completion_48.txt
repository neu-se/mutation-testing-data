  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was adding an 'es' ending to words that end in 'o', but this new code fragment would add an 's' ending to all words that end in 'o', regardless of whether they are preceded by a vowel or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was adding an 'es' ending to words that end in 'o', but this new code fragment would add an 'es' ending to all words that end in 'o', regardless of whether they are preceded by a vowel or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$
