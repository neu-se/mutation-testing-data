Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledError", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the event name from "unhandledRejection" to "unhandledError", which may not be listened for by the application, leading to untracked rejections not being reported correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", promise, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the parameters, which could lead to incorrect handling of the rejection event, as the expected order of arguments for the event listener would be violated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", promise, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly places the promise as the second argument instead of the reason, which could lead to confusion and incorrect processing of the rejection event by any listeners that expect the reason to be the second argument.

DONE.
