  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing an infinite loop or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to skip over certain values or take longer to complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = max
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would set `i` to `max` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to only execute once or not at all.

DONE.
