  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex pattern is removed, causing the pattern to match only lowercase words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex pattern is added, causing the pattern to match both lowercase and uppercase words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty
