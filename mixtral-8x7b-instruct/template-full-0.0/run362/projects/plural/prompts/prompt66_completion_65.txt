 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'memos'.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the original string literal `'memo'` to `'memos'.replace`, which is a function call, causing a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
addRule(/\bmemo\b/i, 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a rule that matches the word `'memo'` with a regular expression that only checks for word boundaries, instead of the original code that checks for the exact string `'memo'`. This could lead to unexpected behavior when testing words similar to `'memo'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
addRule('memo', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the rule for the word `'memo'` to append an `'s'`
