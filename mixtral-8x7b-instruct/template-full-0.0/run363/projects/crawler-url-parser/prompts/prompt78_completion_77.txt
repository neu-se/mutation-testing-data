 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('script')
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects `script` elements instead of `a` elements, potentially causing different URLs to be extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('a').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects all `a` elements except the first one, potentially causing some URLs to be missed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('body a')
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects `a` elements that are descendants of the `body` element, potentially causing URLs in other elements (like the `head`) to be missed.

DONE.
