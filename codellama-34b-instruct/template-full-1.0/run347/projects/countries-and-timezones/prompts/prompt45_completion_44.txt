  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function expects an ID as an argument, but passing `1` would cause the function to return the country with ID `01` instead of the country with ID `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return the country with ID `id + 1` instead of the country with ID `id`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return the country with ID `id * 2` instead of the country with ID `id`.

DONE.
