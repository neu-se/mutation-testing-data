  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator was used instead of the original unary plus operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant 1 was added to the original argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original argument was multiplied by 2.

DONE.
