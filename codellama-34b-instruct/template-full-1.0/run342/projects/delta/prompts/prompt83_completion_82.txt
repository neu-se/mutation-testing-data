  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` checks if two objects are equal, and `!isEqual` checks if they are not equal. If the two objects are not equal, the `if` statement would still execute, even though the `newOp` and `lastOp` objects are identical.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` checks if two objects are equal, and `!isEqual` checks if they are not equal. If the two objects are equal, the `if` statement would still execute, even though the `newOp` and `lastOp` objects are not identical.
