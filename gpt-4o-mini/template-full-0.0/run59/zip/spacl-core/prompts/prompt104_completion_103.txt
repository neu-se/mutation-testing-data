Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.has(name)` checks for the existence of the policy by name, returning a boolean, rather than retrieving the policy object itself, which would lead to incorrect behavior in the subsequent `matches` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name + '1')
```
This would result in different behavior because appending '1' to the name will likely result in a lookup for a non-existent policy, causing the method to always return `false` instead of checking the intended policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because converting the name to lowercase may lead to a mismatch if the policy names are case-sensitive, potentially resulting in a `false` return value even if the policy exists.

DONE.
