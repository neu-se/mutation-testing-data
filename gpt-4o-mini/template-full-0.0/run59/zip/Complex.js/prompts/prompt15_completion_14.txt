Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the input `x`, which changes the output of the `cosm1` function, potentially leading to incorrect results when `x` is small.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the input `x` by 2, which alters the calculation of `cos(x) - 1`, leading to a different output than intended for small values of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the cosine function with the sine function, fundamentally changing the mathematical operation being performed and likely producing incorrect results for the intended calculation of `cos(x) - 1`.

DONE.
