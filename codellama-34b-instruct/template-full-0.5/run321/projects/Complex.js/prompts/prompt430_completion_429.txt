  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` and `Math.ceil` have different rounding behavior, which could cause the `ceil` method to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` and `Math.ceil` have different rounding behavior, which could cause the `ceil` method to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.trunc` and `Math.ceil` have different rounding behavior, which could cause the `ceil` method to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
