  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.fulfill` is not a defined method on the `promise` object, and would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is not a defined method on the `promise` object, and would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve` is not a defined method on the `promise` object, and would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

DONE.
