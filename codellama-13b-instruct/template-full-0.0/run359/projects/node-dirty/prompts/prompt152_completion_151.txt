  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._waitForDrain` flag would be set to `true`, causing the `_flush()` method to wait for the write stream to drain before writing any more data. This would cause the `Dirty` class to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._waitForDrain` flag would be set to `false`, causing the `_flush()` method to write data to the write stream without waiting for it to drain. This would cause the `Dirty` class to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._waitForDrain` flag would be set to `undefined`, causing the
