Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Parsing error");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling `parser_exit()`, which presumably handles the error gracefully, this code will throw an exception, potentially crashing the program if not caught.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { 're': NaN, 'im': NaN };
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of exiting the parser, this code will return an object with both real and imaginary parts set to NaN, which may lead to further calculations being performed on invalid data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Invalid input detected");
```
This would result in different behavior because it merely logs a message to the console instead of terminating the parsing process, allowing the program to continue running with potentially invalid or incomplete data.

DONE.
