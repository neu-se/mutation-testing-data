  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.valueOf = function () {
    return this.promise;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `valueOf` method to return the `promise` property of the `defer` object, which is not the same as the original `valueOf` method that returns the `promise` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.valueOf = function () {
    return this.promise.valueOf();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `valueOf` method to return the result of calling `valueOf` on the `promise` property of the `defer` object, which is not the same as the original `valueOf` method that returns the `promise` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.valueOf = function () {
    return this.promise.promiseDispatch.apply(this.promise,
