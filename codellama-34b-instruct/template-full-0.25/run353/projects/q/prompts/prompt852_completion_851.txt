  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `reject` method would be called instead of `resolve`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method with the string `"error"` instead of the `Error` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("different error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method with a different `Error` object.

DONE.
