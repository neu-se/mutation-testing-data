  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}./`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra slash at the end of the path, which would cause the matcher to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}.+/`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any character (including slashes) after the path, which would cause the matcher to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}.+?/`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any character (including slashes) after the path, but it would do so in a non-greedy way, which would cause the matcher to fail.

DONE.
