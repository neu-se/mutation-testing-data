  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason, whereas `rejected` is a function that is not defined in the given code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fulfill` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled with the given value, whereas `rejected` is a function that is not defined in the given code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error()` will throw an exception, whereas `rejected` is a function that is not defined in the given code fragment.

DONE.
