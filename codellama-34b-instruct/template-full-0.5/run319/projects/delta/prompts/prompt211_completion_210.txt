  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `ops` array from the beginning, while this new code fragment slices it from the second element onwards, which could potentially change the behavior of the `concat` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `ops` array from the beginning to the end, while this new code fragment slices it from the beginning to the second-to-last element, which could potentially change the behavior of the `concat` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `ops` array from the beginning, while this new code fragment slices it from the last element onwards, which could potentially change the behavior of the `concat
