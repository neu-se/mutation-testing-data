  Sure! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 typeof nextOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not defined for the `nextOp` object, so the `typeof` operator would return the string `'undefined'` instead of `'object'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not a function, so the `typeof` operator would return the string `'function'` instead of `'object'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(nextOp) === 1 ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length(nextOp)` method would return a different value than the original code fragment, which would affect the behavior of the `if`
