  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception` is an object, and `exception.value` is a property of that object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, and `exception.value` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.stack` is a string, and `exception.value` is an object.

DONE.
