  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `file` variable as a parameter for the `fs.writeFile` method, which expects a file path as a string. By adding `.json` to the end of the file path, the method would be called with a different file path, which could cause the test to fail if the method is not able to write to the new file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace('.json', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `file` variable as a parameter for the `fs.writeFile` method, which expects a file path as a string. By removing the `.json` extension from the file path using the `replace` method, the method would be called with a different file path, which could cause the test to fail if the method is not able to write to the new file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
