  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["dispatch"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch` is a property accessor and `Q(object)["dispatch"]` is a method call, which may have different behaviors depending on the implementation of the `Q` function and the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch().inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch()` returns a promise, and calling `inspect()` on that promise may provide different information than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function (dispatch) { return dispatch; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).then()` allows the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
