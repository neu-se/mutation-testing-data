  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This change will cause the `set` method to store `null` as the value for the given key, instead of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 'undefined', cb
```
This change will cause the `set` method to store the string `'undefined'` as the value for the given key, instead of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined, null
```
This change will cause the `set` method to store `undefined` as the value for the given key, but will not call the callback function.

DONE.
