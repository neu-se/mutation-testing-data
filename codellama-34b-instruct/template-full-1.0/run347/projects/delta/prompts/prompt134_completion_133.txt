  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `nextOp` returns the next operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `nextOp` returns the next operation in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[index]` references the operation at the current index in the delta, while `nextOp` references the next operation in the delta.

DONE.
