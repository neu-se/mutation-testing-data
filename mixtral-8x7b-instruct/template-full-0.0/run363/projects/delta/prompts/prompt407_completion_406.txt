 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `handler` variable could be `null`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to access its `transform` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty object, which is not the intended behavior. The `handler.transform` method should return a transformed object based on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` value is inverted, which could lead to unexpected results when handling operations with different priorities.

DONE.
