  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the promise is pending.

DONE.
