Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially causing the same operation to be processed multiple times instead of moving to the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(1)` always advances the iterator by one operation, regardless of the actual length, which may lead to skipping necessary operations or processing incorrect ones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because using `peekLength()` may not correspond to the intended operation length, leading to incorrect operations being processed or omitted entirely.

DONE.
