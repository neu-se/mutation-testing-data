  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is fulfilled, `rejected` would not be called, but `fulfilled` would be called instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is rejected, the `rejected` function would be called with `undefined` as the reason, which may cause a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause the code to jump to the catch block, skipping the `rejected` function entirely.

DONE.
