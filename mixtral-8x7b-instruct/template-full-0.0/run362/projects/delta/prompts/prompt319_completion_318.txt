 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted.retain = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reassign the `retain` method of the `inverted` Delta object to `undefined`, causing errors when the `retain` method is called later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted['noRetain'] = inverted.retain;
inverted.retain = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new property `noRetain` that references the original `retain` method, and then replace the `retain` method with an empty function, causing the `retain` method to have no effect when called later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
const originalRetain = inverted.retain;
inverted.retain = (length: number, attributes?: AttributeMap) => {
  originalRetain(length *
