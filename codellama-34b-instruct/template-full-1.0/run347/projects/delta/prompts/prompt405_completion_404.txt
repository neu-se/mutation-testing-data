  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 () => {
  throw new Error('Dummy error');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Delta.getHandler` is a function that retrieves a handler for a given embed type, but this replacement code fragment is a function that always throws an error, regardless of the embed type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 (embedType) => {
  return {
    [embedType]: undefined
  };
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Delta.getHandler` is a function that retrieves a handler for a given embed type, but this replacement code fragment is a function that always returns an object with an undefined property corresponding to the embed type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 (embedType, data) => {
  return data ? data[embedType] : undefined;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Delta.getHandler`
