  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `String.fromCharCode` returns a string representing the character with the given Unicode code point, while the modified code fragment `String.fromCharCode(0)` returns a string representing the null character (U+0000).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `String.fromCharCode` returns a string representing the character with the given Unicode code point, while the modified code fragment `String.fromCharCode(1)` returns a string representing the start of heading (U+0001) character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0x1F600)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `String.fromCharCode` returns a string representing the character with the given Unicode code
