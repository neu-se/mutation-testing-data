  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected, _rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the first `_rejected` will resolve the promise with the reason, while the second `_rejected` will reject the promise with the same reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` will throw an exception, while `resolve` will resolve the promise with the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled, _rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` will return the value, while `_rejected` will reject the promise with the reason.

DONE.
