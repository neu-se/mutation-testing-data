Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from `message` to `reason`, which would incorrectly pass the rejection reason instead of the message, potentially leading to incorrect handling of promise resolutions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the first message in the `messages` array instead of the current `message`, which could lead to incorrect dispatching of the promise operations if the first message is not relevant to the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `message` with `null`, which would mean that no arguments are passed to the `promiseDispatch` method, potentially causing the promise to not resolve or reject correctly.

DONE.
