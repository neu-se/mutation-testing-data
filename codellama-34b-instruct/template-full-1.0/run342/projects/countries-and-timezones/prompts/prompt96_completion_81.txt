  Option 1:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<key> [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `map` function to create a new array with the same number of elements as the original `values` array, but with each element being a different key from the corresponding index in the `values` array. In contrast, the code fragment with `[key]` would create a new array with a single element, which would be the value associated with the `key` property of the `values` array.

Option 2:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<Object.values at index key>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `map` function to create a new array with the same number of elements as the original `values` array, but with each element being a different key from the corresponding index in the `values` array. In contrast, the code fragment with `Object.values at index key` would create a new array with a single element, which would be the value associated with the index `key` in
