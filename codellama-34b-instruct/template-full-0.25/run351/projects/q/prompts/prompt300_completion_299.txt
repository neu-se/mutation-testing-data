  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(this)` would return a promise that is already resolved with the value of `this`, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that may be resolved or rejected later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(this)` would return a promise that is already rejected with the value of `this`, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that may be resolved or rejected later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([this])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all([this])` would return a promise that is resolved with an array containing the value of `this`, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that may be resolved or rejected later.

DONE.
