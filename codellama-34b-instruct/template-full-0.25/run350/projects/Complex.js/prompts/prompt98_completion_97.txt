  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the imaginary unit is now case-sensitive, so it would not match the string "i" or "I".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' && tokens[i + 2] === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the imaginary unit is now checking for the string "ii" instead of "i" or "I".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I' || tokens[i + 1] === 'j'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the imaginary unit is now also checking for the string "j".

DONE.
