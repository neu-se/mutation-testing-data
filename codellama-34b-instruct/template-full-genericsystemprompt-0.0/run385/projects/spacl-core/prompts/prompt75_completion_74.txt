  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the result is exactly `true`, while this new code fragment checks if the result is not exactly `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the result is exactly `true`, while this new code fragment checks if the result is exactly `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the result is exactly `true`, while this new code fragment checks if the result is not exactly `false`.

DONE.
