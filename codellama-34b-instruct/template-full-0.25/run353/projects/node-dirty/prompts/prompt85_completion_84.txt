  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split` method with no arguments, which splits the string into an array of substrings using whitespace as the separator. In contrast, the modified code splits the string into an array of substrings using a newline character as the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split` method with no arguments, which splits the string into an array of substrings using whitespace as the separator. In contrast, the modified code splits the string into an array of substrings using an empty string as the separator, which would result in an array of single characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split` method with no arguments, which splits the string into an array of substrings using whitespace
