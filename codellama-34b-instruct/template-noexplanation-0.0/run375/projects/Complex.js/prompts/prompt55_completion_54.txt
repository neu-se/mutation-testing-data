  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This change will cause the function to return the cosine of the argument instead of the sine, which will result in a different output for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This change will cause the function to return the tangent of the argument instead of the sine, which will result in a different output for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This change will cause the function to return the arcsine of the argument instead of the sine, which will result in a different output for the same input.

DONE.
