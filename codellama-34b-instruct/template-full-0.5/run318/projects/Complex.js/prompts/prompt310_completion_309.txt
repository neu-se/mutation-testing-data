  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the sum of the real and imaginary parts, instead of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the difference between the real and imaginary parts, instead of the real part.

DONE.
