  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function call, but the new code fragment `done(end === true ? null : end)` is a function call with an argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === false ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function call, but the new code fragment `done(end === false ? null : end)` is a function call with an argument that is the opposite of the original argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === null ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function call, but the new code fragment `done(end === null ? null : end)` is a function call with
