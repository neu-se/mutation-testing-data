  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` computes the arccosine of a number, whereas `Math.atan2` computes the arctangent of two numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` computes the arcsine of a number, whereas `Math.atan2` computes the arctangent of two numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` computes the arctangent of a number, whereas `Math.atan2` computes the arctangent of two numbers.

DONE.
