  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would stringify the `key` and `val` values separately, rather than together as a single object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(this._data.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would stringify the value associated with the `key` in the `_data` object, rather than the `key` and `val` values together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify({key: key, val: val})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would stringify the `key` and `val` values together as a single object, rather than separately.

DONE.
