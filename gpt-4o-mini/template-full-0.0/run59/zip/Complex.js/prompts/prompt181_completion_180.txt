Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part of the complex number `z` is zero instead of checking if `z` itself is zero, which could lead to incorrect results when `z` has a non-zero real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional check for `this` being zero, which could change the outcome of the condition and potentially allow for cases where both numbers are zero to be treated differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this` is infinite instead of checking if `z` is zero, which would completely alter the logic of the function and could lead to incorrect handling of complex number operations involving infinity.

DONE.
