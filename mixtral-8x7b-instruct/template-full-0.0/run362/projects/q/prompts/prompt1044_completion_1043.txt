 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is used to chain promises, and `get` is not a method of the result of `then`. This would cause an error and the `get` method would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get.bind(ends.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is used to create a new function with the `this` value set to a specific object. In this case, it would cause an error because `get` is not a method of the result of `bind`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.head
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise` is a promise object, and it doesn't have a `head` property. This would cause an error and the `get` method would not be called.
