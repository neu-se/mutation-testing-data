  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring` would return a substring of `w` starting from the specified index, whereas `w.substr` would return a substring of `w` starting from the specified index with the specified length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice` would return a substring of `w` starting from the specified index with the specified length, whereas `w.substr` would return a substring of `w` starting from the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring of `w` starting from the specified index with the specified length, and then append 'ices' to the end of the substring.

DONE.
