  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code fragment, which was `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code fragment, which was `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code fragment, which was `data`.

DONE.
