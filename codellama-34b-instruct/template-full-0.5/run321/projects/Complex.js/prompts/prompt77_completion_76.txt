  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the variable `i` instead of incrementing it, which would cause the loop to run for a different number of iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the variable `i` by 2 instead of 1, which would cause the loop to run for a different number of iterations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the variable `i` by 1, but it would also assign the result of the addition to the variable `i`, which would cause the loop to run for a different number of iterations.

DONE.
