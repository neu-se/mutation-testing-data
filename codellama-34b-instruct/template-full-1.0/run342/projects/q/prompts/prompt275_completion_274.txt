  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `self` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context to the current `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method of the `deferred` object, which is a different object than `this` or `self`.

DONE.
