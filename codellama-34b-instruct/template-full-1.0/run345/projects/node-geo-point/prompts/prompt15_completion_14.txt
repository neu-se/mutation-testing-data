  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would expect the coordinates to be in the order [latitude, longitude], but `point.coordinates.reverse()` would return the coordinates in the order [longitude, latitude].

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would expect the coordinates to be in the order [latitude, longitude], but `point.coordinates.slice(1)` would only return the longitude coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(point.coordinates[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would expect the coordinates to be in the order [latitude, longitude], but `Math.round(point.coordinates[0])` would return the rounded latitude coordinate.

DONE.
