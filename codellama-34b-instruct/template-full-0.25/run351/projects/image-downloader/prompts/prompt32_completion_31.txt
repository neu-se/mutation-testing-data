  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === 404
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a status code of 200, which indicates a successful response, while the new code fragment checks for a status code of 404, which indicates a client error. If the server returns a 404 status code, the original code would continue to consume the response data and resolve the promise, while the new code would reject the promise with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 404
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a status code of 200, which indicates a successful response, while the new code fragment checks for a status code that is not 404, which could include other client error status codes. If the server returns a client error status code other than 404, the original code would continue to consume the response data and resolve the promise, while the new code would reject the promise with an error.
