 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` would be set to `setImmediate` unconditionally, even in non-supporting environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` would be set to `setImmediate` unconditionally, due to the always-truthy comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof window !== "undefined" || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `|| true` part would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `requestTick` to be set to `setImmediate` unconditionally.

DONE.
