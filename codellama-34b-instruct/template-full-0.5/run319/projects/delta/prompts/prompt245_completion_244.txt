  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the length of the operation, potentially causing the iterator to skip over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the length of the operation, potentially causing the iterator to repeat the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the operation, potentially causing the iterator to skip over the next operation or repeat the current operation.

DONE.
