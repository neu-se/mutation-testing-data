  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, done
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and `undefined` is falsy, so the function would not be called with `done` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, done
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is truthy and would result in the function being called with `done` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, done
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is falsy and would not result in the function being called with `done` as an argument.

DONE.
