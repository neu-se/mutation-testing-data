  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, instead of an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array of arguments, but the first argument would be `undefined`, instead of the actual value of the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array of arguments, but the first argument would be `0`, instead of the actual value of the first argument.

DONE.
