 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define.amd
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `amd` property of the `define` object instead of using the bracket notation, which may not work in some environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'object' && exports.define
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of an `exports.define` property, which does not exist in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof global === 'object' && global.define
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a `global.define` property, which does not exist in the original code.

DONE.
