  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length, otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the this iterator, which could cause the code to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length, length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length of the operation by 1, which could cause the code to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length, length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the length of the operation by 1, which could cause the code to produce different results.

DONE.
