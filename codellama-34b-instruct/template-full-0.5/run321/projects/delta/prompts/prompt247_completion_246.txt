  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `retain` operation to retain one more character than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is decremented by 1, which would cause the `retain` operation to retain one fewer character than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `retain` operation to retain twice as many characters as expected.

DONE.
