  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the same object, rather than a new tile object with the specified zoom level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the zoom level, rather than a new tile object with the specified zoom level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Tile(zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new tile object with the specified zoom level, rather than returning the tile object associated with the current object.

DONE.
