Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it does not escape special regex characters (like `.` or `$`), potentially leading to incorrect regex patterns that match unintended strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.toUpperCase()}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the path segment to uppercase, which may not match the intended case-sensitive paths, leading to mismatches in path matching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.*])/g, '\\$1')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly escapes the `*` character instead of the `.` and `$`, which could lead to unexpected matches in the regex pattern.

DONE.
