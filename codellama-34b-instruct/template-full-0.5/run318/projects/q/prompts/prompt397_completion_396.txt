  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method will always reject the promise, regardless of the resolution of the previous promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method will always resolve the promise with the value `null`, regardless of the resolution of the previous promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function () { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method will always resolve the promise with the value `null`, regardless of the resolution of the previous promise.

DONE.
