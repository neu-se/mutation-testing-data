 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, but skips the first argument, which is the `name` variable in this context. The original code fragment, `arguments`, is an array-like object that contains all arguments passed to the function, including `name`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the `arguments` property of the current object (`this`), which is not defined in this context. The original code fragment, `arguments`, is an array-like object that contains all arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `arguments` object with `null`, which would cause an error in the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line
