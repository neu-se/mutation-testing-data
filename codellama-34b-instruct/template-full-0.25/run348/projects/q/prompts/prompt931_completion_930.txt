  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the context of the function being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, whereas `apply` and `call` simply call the function with the specified context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function with a null context and an empty array of arguments, whereas the original code called the function with the `Q` object as the context and the `args` array as the arguments.

DONE.
