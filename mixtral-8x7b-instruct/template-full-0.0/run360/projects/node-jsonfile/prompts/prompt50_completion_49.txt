 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment writes the string to the file and returns the number of bytes written, while this replacement would return `undefined` (since `fs.writeFileSync` doesn't return a value).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.appendFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the contents of the file with the new string, while this replacement would append the new string to the existing contents of the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.writeFileSync(file, str + '\n', options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment writes the string to the file without any line break, while this replacement would add a line break at the end of the string.

DONE.
