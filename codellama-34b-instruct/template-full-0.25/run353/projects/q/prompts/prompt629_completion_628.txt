  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the `set` method to assign the value of the `key` argument to the `value` property of the object, rather than the other way around.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of the `key` argument plus one to the `value` property of the object, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of the `key` argument multiplied by two to the `value` property of the object, rather than the original value.

DONE.
