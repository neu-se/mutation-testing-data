  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `pop` removes and returns the last element of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `shift` removes and returns the first element of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.unshift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

DONE.
