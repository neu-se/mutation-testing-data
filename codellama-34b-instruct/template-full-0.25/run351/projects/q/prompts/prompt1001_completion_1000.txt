  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch` is a method that dispatches a message to an object, while `Q(object).dispatch.bind(object)` is a bound method that is called on the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch` is a method that dispatches a message to an object, while `Q(object).dispatch.call(object)` is a method that is called on the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch` is a method that dispatches a message to an object, while `Q(object).dispatch.apply(object)` is a method that is called on the object itself.
