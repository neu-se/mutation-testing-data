  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and will throw an error when attempting to call it with the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is also not a function and will throw an error when attempting to call it with the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a function and will throw an error when attempting to call it with the `then` method.

DONE.
