  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of the word "mouse," which is "mice." However, the new code fragment would return the singular form of the word "mouse," which is "mouse."

DONE.
