  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, while the replaced code fragment uses the `b` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, while the replaced code fragment uses the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, while the replaced code fragment uses the product of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
