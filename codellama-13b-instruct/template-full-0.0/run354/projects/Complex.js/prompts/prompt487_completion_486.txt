  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.ZERO
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `Complex` object, while the new code fragment refers to the `Complex.ZERO` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.ONE
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `Complex` object, while the new code fragment refers to the `Complex.ONE` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.I
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `Complex` object, while the new code fragment refers to the `Complex.I` property.

DONE.
