  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` is a function that calculates the square root of a number, while `a*a + b*b` is an expression that calculates the square of `a` and `b` and adds them together.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` is a function that calculates the power of a number, while `a*a + b*b` is an expression that calculates the square of `a` and `b` and adds them together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.hypot(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.hypot` is a function that calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle, while `a*a + b*b` is an
