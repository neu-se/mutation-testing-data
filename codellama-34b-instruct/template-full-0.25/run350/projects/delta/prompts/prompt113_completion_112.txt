  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 1).reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only reduce the first element of the `ops` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.retain).reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only reduce the elements of the `ops` array that have a `retain` property, rather than the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(op => op.retain).reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only reduce the `retain` property of each element in the `ops` array, rather than the entire array.

DONE.
