  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` option is not being passed to `JSON.parse`, which could cause issues if the JSON data contains custom data types that require a reviver function to be parsed correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid `options` object for `JSON.parse`, so it would throw an error if the `reviver` option is not being passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `options` is not a valid `data` object for `JSON.parse`, so it would throw an error if the `reviver` option is not being passed.

DONE.
