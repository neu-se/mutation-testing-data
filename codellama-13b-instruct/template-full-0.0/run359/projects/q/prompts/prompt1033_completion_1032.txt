  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeback` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeback` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeback` function would be called with the string "error" as the first argument, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
