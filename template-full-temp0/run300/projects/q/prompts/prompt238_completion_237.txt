  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `nearerValue`, whereas the original code fragment used the `+` operator to concatenate strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `nearerValue` by 2, whereas the original code fragment used the `+` operator to concatenate strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method would convert the value of `nearerValue` to a string, whereas the original code fragment used the `+` operator to concatenate strings.

DONE.
