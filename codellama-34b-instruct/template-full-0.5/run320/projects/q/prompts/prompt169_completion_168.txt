  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` is a function that checks if a stack frame is from Node.js, and it would cause the `filterStackString` function to filter out stack frames that are from Node.js, which would change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a function that checks if a value is promise-like, meaning it has a `then` method, and it would cause the `coerce` function to coerce promises from different systems, which would change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame` is a function that checks if a stack frame is from the current file, and it would cause the `filterStackString` function to filter out stack frames that are from the
