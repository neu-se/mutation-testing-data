  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\default\.[a-z]+$/` would not match any part of the `pageurl_path` string, so the `replace` method would not modify the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\default\.[a-z]+$/` would match the end of the `pageurl_path` string, so the `replace` method would remove the last part of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$
