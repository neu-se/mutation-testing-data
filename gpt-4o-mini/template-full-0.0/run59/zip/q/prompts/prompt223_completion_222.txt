Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(null)` creates an object with no prototype, which means it won't inherit any properties or methods from `Promise.prototype`, leading to potential errors when trying to access methods that are expected to exist on the promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Array.prototype` instead of `Promise.prototype` would create an object that behaves like an array, which does not have the necessary promise methods, causing the promise functionality to break.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because assigning `null` would mean that `promise` is not an object at all, leading to runtime errors when any method is called on `promise`, as it would not be able to access any properties or methods.

DONE.
