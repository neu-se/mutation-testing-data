  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of the `busy` variable, so the mutated code would enter the `else` block even if the `busy` variable is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable is a function, and referring to it would cause the code to enter the `if` block even if the `busy` variable is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!map
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of the `map` variable, so the mutated code would enter the `if` block even if the `busy` variable is `true`.

DONE.
