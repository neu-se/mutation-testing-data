 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is the correct way to calculate the cosine of a number in JavaScript, while `cos` is a reference to a local variable or function that might not be defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the `cos` function with the number `0` would always result in `0` as the y-coordinate, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is the sine function, which is not the same as the cosine function. This would result in incorrect values for the y-coordinate, leading to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
