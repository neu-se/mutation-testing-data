  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `places && 0` would always return `0`, regardless of the value of `places`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 || places
```
This would result in different behavior because `0 || places` would always return `places`, regardless of the value of `places`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `-places || 0` would always return `0` if `places` is a non-zero number, and `-places` if `places` is `0`.

DONE.
