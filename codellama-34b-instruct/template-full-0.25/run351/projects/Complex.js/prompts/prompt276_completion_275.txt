  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.sin()` function with a single argument, but this replacement code fragment uses the `Math.sin()` function with two arguments, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.sin()` function with a single argument, but this replacement code fragment uses the `Math.sin()` function with two arguments, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.sin()` function with a single argument, but this replacement code fragment uses the `Math.sin()` function with two arguments, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
