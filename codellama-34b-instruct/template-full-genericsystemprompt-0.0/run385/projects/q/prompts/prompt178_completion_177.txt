  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:)"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return -1, indicating that the substring is not present in the string, even if it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:)"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return 0, indicating that the substring is present at the beginning of the string, even if it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:)"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return a non-zero value, indicating that the substring is present in the string, even if it is not.

DONE.
