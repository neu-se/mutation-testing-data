Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value being captured by adding 1, which may lead to incorrect line number reporting in stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the captured line number by 2, potentially leading to an incorrect line number in stack traces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original function call with `undefined`, which would cause the code to fail when trying to use the line number, leading to unexpected behavior in error handling.

DONE.
