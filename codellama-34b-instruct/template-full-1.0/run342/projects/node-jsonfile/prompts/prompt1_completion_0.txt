  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this replacement code fragment checks if it is an object. This could cause the function to behave differently when called with different types of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding || 'utf-8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `options` argument to determine the encoding of the file, while this replacement code fragment assigns the encoding to a default value of `utf-8` if it is not provided. This could cause the function to behave differently when called with different encoding options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `options` argument to determine whether or not to throw an error if the file cannot be read, while this replacement code fragment assigns the `throws` property
