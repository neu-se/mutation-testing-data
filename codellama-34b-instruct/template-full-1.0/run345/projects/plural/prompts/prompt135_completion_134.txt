  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
((() => {
  const result = word.substr(0, word.length - 1) + 'i';
  return result;
})();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a regular expression that matched the end of the word, but this new code fragment does not use regular expressions and returns a substring of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a regular expression that matched the end of the word, but this new code fragment modifies the case of the word and does not test for the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  if (word.indexOf('quy') > -1) {
    return word + '_quy';
  } else {
    return word;
  }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to test for
