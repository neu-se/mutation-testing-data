  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This change will cause the reducer function to return a different value than the original code, which may cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the reducer function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This change will also cause the reducer function to return a different value than the original code, which may cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the reducer function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This change will cause the reducer function to return a different value than the original code, which may cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the reducer function.

DONE.
