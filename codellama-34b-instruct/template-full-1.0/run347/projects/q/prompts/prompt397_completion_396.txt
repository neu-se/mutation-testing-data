  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` will cause the promise to be rejected, while `thenResolve` will cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` will cause the promise to be resolved with the return value of the callback, while `thenResolve` will cause it to be fulfilled with the value passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(1).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is not a promise, so it will be fulfilled with the value `1` rather than being passed through to the `thenResolve` method.

DONE.
