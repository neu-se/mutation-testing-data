  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b * Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, so the result would be a random value that is different from the original value of `2 * b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is not defined, so the result would be `NaN` (Not a Number), which is different from the original value of `2 * b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (b + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be `2 * (b + a)` instead of `2 * b`, which is a different value.

DONE.
