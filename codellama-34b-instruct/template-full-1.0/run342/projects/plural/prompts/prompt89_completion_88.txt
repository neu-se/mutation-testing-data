  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'dogs'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "dogs" is not a valid plural form for the word "person".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'pider', 'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "pider" is not a valid word and the plural form for "people" is "people", not "person".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'sand'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "sand" is not a valid plural form for the word "person".

DONE.
