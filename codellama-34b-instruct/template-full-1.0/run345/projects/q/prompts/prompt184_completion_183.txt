  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Number` to convert the input to a number, while the replaced code fragment uses `String` to convert the input to a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`typeof attempt1`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `typeof` operator to check if the input is a string, while the replaced code fragment uses `typeof attempt1` to check if the input is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`attempt1`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `attempt1` to check if the input is a function, while the replaced code fragment uses `attempt1` to check if the input is a string.

DONE.
