  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString() + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a string representing the `process` object, while the modified code fragment would return a string concatenating the string representation of `process` with the string "foo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a string representing the `process` object, while the modified code fragment would return a string representing the `process` object in binary format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a string representing the `process` object, while the modified code fragment would return a string representing the `null` object.

DONE.
