  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData.length` would return the length of the `thisData` object, which is not necessarily the same as the length of the `otherData` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.length + otherData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData.length + otherData.length` would return the sum of the lengths of the `thisData` and `otherData` objects, which is not necessarily the same as the length of the `otherData` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData.length` would return the length of the `otherData` object, which is not necessarily the same as the length of the `thisData` object.

DONE.
