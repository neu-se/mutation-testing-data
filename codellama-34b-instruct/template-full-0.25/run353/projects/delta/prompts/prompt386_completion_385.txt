  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment takes the minimum of the two lengths, while this replacement takes the sum.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment takes the minimum of the two lengths, while this replacement takes the maximum.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment takes the minimum of the two lengths, while this replacement takes their product.

DONE.
