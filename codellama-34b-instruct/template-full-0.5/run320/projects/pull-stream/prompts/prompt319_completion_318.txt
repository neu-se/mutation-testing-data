  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `end` parameter of the callback function, and it may cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is not a valid value for the `end` parameter of the callback function, and it may cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is not a valid value for the `end` parameter of the callback function, and it may cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
