Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always start the substring from the beginning of the string, effectively ignoring the current offset and potentially returning more characters than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the substring one character after the current offset, which could lead to missing the first character of the remaining string and returning an incorrect portion of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to read one more character than specified by the `length`, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or returning more characters than expected if the length is already at the end of the string.

DONE.
