Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unknownOperation"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the fallback function to be invoked with a string that does not correspond to any operation in the descriptor, leading to a rejection with the error "Promise does not support operation: unknownOperation".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the fallback function to be called with `null` as the operation, which is not a valid operation name, resulting in a rejection with the error "Promise does not support operation: null".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first argument from the `args` array as the operation name instead of the intended `op`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `args[0]` does not match any method in the descriptor, causing the fallback to be triggered incorrectly.

DONE.
