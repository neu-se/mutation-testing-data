  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `a`, potentially causing the `logHypot` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `a`, and the `logHypot` function would return a different value based on the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* b` operation would change the value of `a`, potentially causing the `logHypot` function to return a different value.

DONE.
