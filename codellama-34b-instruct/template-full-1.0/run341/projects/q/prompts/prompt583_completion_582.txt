  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is meant to handle the resolution of the promise, while the `errback` function is meant to handle the rejection of the promise. Using `errback` instead of `callback` would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function passed to the `then` method will be called with both the resolved value and the rejected reason. Using `callback` and `errback` in this way would cause the function to be called twice, once with the resolved value and once with the rejected reason, resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(successCallback, failureCallback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `successCallback` and `failureCallback` arguments are functions that will be called with
