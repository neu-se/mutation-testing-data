  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the result array instead of the whole array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result instead of returning the result as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result array without the first element instead of the whole array.

DONE.
