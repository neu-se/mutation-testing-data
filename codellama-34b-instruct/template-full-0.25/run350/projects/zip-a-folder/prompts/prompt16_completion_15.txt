  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for read permission, whereas the original code fragment checks for both read and write permission.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for write permission, whereas the original code fragment checks for both read and write permission.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.X_OK)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for execute permission, whereas the original code fragment checks for both read and write permission.

DONE.
