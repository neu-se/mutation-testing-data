 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path = linkurl_path;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the path of the linkurl with the path of the pageurl, even if they have different domains or subdomains.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path = "";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consider the path of the pageurl as an empty string, which would affect the comparison with the path of the linkurl.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path = Math.random().toString();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a random string to the pageurl\_path variable, which would affect the comparison with the path of the linkurl.

DONE.
