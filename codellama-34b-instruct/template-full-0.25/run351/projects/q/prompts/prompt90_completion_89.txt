  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` expects a function as its argument, but `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that needs to be called on an array object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Math.max)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` expects a function as its argument, but `Math.max` is a method that needs to be called on a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Object.keys)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` expects a function as its argument, but `Object.keys` is a method that needs to be called on an object.

DONE.
