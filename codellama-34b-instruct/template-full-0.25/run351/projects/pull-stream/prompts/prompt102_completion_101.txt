  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` is a different method than `console.log`, and it would cause the `log` function to output the `data` to the error console instead of the regular console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.toString()` would convert the `data` object to a string, which would be different from the original behavior of `console.log(data)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.length` would output the length of the `data` object, which would be different from the original behavior of `console.log(data)`.

DONE.
