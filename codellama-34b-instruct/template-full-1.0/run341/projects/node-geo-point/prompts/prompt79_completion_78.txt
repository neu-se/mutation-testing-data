  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.longitude` property is used instead of `.latitude`, which could result in the `calculateDestination()` method returning an incorrect destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.latitude` property is multiplied by 2, which could result in the `calculateDestination()` method returning a destination point that is twice as far as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.latitude` property is set to `null`, which could result in the `calculateDestination()` method returning a destination point that is null, which could cause errors in other parts of the code that depend on the value of the destination point.

DONE.
