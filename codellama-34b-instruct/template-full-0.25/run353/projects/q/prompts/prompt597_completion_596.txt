  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a different `this` context, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `dispatch` method with a different `this` context, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `dispatch` method with a different `this` context, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
