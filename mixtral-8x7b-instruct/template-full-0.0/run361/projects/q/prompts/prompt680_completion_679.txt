 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects an array-like object as its second argument, but `arguments` is passed directly, which may not behave as expected in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the array passed to `apply` is now `undefined`, which may cause issues if the function being applied expects a specific value in the first position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
