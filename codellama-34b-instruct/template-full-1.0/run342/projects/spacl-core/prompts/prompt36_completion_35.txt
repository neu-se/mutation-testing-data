  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(-1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method with negative values reverses the order of elements in the array starting from the end, whereas the original code starts from the beginning and slices until the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(0, -1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method with a negative end index takes all elements until the specified index from the end of the array. The original code takes all elements until the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method takes all elements from the array, whereas the original code takes all elements except the first one.
DONE.
