  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 10 as the base, instead of using the value of `places` if it is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return Infinity as the base, instead of using the value of `places` if it is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return NaN as the base, instead of using the value of `places` if it is defined.

DONE.
