  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad * Math.PI / 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the radian value of `point1.latitude` using the formula `degrees * pi / 180`, which is different from the original code that used the `deg2rad` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad * 0.017453292519943295;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the radian value of `point1.latitude` using a hardcoded value for pi (180 degrees) instead of using the `deg2rad` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad * 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the radian value of `point1.latitude` using a scale factor of 1 instead of using the `deg2
