  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections` is a different array than `reportedUnhandledRejections`, and the code would not be able to track the rejections correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would not have any rejections to track, and the code would not be able to handle any rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, and the code would throw an error when trying to access the `indexOf` method.

DONE.
