 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds a number to the nearest integer, while `parseFloat` converts a string into a floating point number. This could lead to unexpected results when adjusting the precision of the geo point's coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
input => input * 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it simply converts the number to an integer by multiplying it with 1, which could lead to loss of precision when adjusting the precision of the geo point's coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
input => Math.floor(input)
