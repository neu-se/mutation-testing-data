  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because φ1 and φ2 represent the latitude of the first and second point, respectively. Using φ1 instead of φ2 would calculate the bearing using the first point's latitude, which would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because λ1 and λ2 represent the longitude of the first and second point, respectively. Using λ1 instead of λ2 would calculate the bearing using the first point's longitude, which would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
π + φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because π is an irrational number and adding it to φ1 would skew the calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
