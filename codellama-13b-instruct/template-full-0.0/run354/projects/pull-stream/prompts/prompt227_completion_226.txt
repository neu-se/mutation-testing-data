  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would be called on the `test` variable, which would cause the test to pass even if the original code fragment was not executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be accessed on the `test` variable, which would cause the test to pass even if the original code fragment was not executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method would be called on the `test` variable, which would cause the test to pass even if the original code fragment was not executed.

DONE.
