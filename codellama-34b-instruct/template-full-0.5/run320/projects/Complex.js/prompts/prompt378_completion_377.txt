  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` refers to the variable `a`, while the new code fragment `a + b` refers to the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` refers to the variable `a`, while the new code fragment `a * b` refers to the product of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` refers to the variable `a`, while the new code fragment `a / b` refers to the quotient of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
