  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `test` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, and `test` is always a truthy value, so the `if` statement would never be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, and `test` is always a truthy value, so the `if` statement would always be executed.

DONE.
