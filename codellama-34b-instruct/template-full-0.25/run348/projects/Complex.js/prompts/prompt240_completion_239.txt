  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to return incorrect values for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to return incorrect values for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to return incorrect values for certain inputs.

DONE.
