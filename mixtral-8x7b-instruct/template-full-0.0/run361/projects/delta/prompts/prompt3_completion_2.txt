 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` does not perform a deep copy, unlike `cloneDeep`. It only copies the enumerable and own properties from the source object to the target object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an empty object, regardless of the input. This would break the functionality of the `compose`, `diff`, `invert`, and `transform` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because it performs a deep copy using JSON stringification and parsing. However, this method has limitations, such as not being able to serialize functions, undefined values, and certain objects like `Map`, `Set`, `Date`, `RegExp`, etc.

DONE.
