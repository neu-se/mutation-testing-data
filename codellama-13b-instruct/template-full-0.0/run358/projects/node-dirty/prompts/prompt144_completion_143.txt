  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be true, causing the `drain` event to be emitted immediately after the `cork` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be false, causing the `drain` event to never be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be true, causing the `drain` event to be emitted immediately after the `cork` method is called.

DONE.
