  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a new Complex object with the result of the multiplication, while this code returns a NaN value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a new Complex object with the result of the multiplication, while this code returns an Infinity value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a new Complex object with the result of the multiplication, while this code returns a new Complex object with both real and imaginary parts equal to zero.

DONE.
