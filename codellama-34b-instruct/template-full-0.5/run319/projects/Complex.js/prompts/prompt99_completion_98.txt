  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(c) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `parseFloat(c)` would return a float value, whereas the modified code fragment `parseFloat(c) + 1` would return a float value plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(c) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `parseFloat(c)` would return a float value, whereas the modified code fragment `parseFloat(c) * 2` would return a float value multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(c) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `parseFloat(c)` would return a float value, whereas the modified code fragment `parseFloat(c) - 1` would return a float value minus 1.

DONE.
