  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith()` checks if the string starts with the given substring, while `includes()` checks if the string contains the given substring. In this case, `startsWith()` would return `false` for the input `sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd` and `sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/ccc`, which would cause the function to return `"internal"` instead of `"sublevel"`.

DONE.
