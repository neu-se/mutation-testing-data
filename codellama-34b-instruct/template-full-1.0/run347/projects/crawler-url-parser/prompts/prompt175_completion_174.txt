  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, while `parse` parses a string and returns a URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello, World!"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"Hello, World!"` is a string, while `parse` parses a string and returns a URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a null value, while `parse` parses a string and returns a URL object.

DONE.
