  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a single value, while the modified code fragment `acc + data` is a sum of two values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a single value, while the modified code fragment `acc * data` is a product of two values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a single value, while the modified code fragment `acc - data` is a difference of two values.

DONE.
