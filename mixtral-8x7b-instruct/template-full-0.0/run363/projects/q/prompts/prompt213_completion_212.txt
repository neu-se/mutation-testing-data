 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value is an instance of Object, rather than checking if it has a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === 'object' && 'then' in value
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value is an object and has a 'then' property, rather than checking if it has a `then` method that behaves like a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value && typeof value === 'object' && typeof value.then === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value is not null/undefined, is an object, and has a 'then' method that is a function, rather than checking if it has a `then` method that behaves like a promise.

DONE.
