  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the peeked operation to be one more than the actual length, which could cause the algorithm to skip over a valid operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the peeked operation to be one less than the actual length, which could cause the algorithm to include an extra operation that it should not have.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the peeked operation to be twice the actual length, which could cause the algorithm to include an extra operation that it should not have, or to skip over a valid operation.

DONE.
