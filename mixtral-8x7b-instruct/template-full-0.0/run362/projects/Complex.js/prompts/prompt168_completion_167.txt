 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'div' method would return 'Complex.INFINITY' when dividing by a non-zero complex number with an infinite real or imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'div' method would return 'Complex.INFINITY' when dividing by a complex number with an infinite real part and non-zero imaginary part, even if the denominator is not zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'div' method would return 'Complex.INFINITY' when dividing by a complex number with an infinite imaginary part and non-zero real part, even if the denominator is not zero.

DONE.
