  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (&&), which requires both conditions to be true, while the replaced code fragment uses the logical OR operator (||), which only requires one of the conditions to be true. This change would cause the function to return a different result when the `parsedUrl.host` is null and `baseUrlStr` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null && !baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (&&), which requires both conditions to be true, while the replaced code fragment uses the logical AND operator (&&) with the negation operator (!) on the `baseUrlStr` condition. This change would cause the function to return a different result when the `parsedUrl.host` is null and `baseUrlStr` is falsey (e.g. null, undefined, or an empty
