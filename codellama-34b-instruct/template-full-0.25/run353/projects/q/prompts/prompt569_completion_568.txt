  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `errback` is a function that handles errors and returns a promise for the result of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `errback` is a function that handles errors and returns a promise for the result of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error()` would throw an error and return a rejected promise, whereas `errback` is a function that handles errors and returns a promise for the result of the operation.

DONE.
