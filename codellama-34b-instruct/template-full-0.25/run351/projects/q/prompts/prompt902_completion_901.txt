  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that is called when the promise is resolved, whereas `fail` is a method that is called when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that is called when the promise is rejected, whereas `fail` is a method that is called when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that is called when the promise is either resolved or rejected, whereas `fail` is a method that is called when the promise is rejected.

DONE.
