  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value as the first argument for the `toTile` method, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude value as the first argument for the `toTile` method, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument for the `toTile` method, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
