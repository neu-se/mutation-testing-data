  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports.parse = parse;
```
This would result in different behavior because `module.exports.parse` is not a boolean value, and the `!` operator would always return `true` when applied to a non-boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports.extract = extract;
```
This would result in different behavior because `module.exports.extract` is not a boolean value, and the `!` operator would always return `true` when applied to a non-boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports.gettype = gettype;
```
This would result in different behavior because `module.exports.gettype` is not a boolean value, and the `!` operator would always return `true` when applied to a non-boolean value.

DONE.
