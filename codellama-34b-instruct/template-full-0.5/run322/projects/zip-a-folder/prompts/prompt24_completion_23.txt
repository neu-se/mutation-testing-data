  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'zip'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always create a zip file, even if the input format was different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'tar'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always create a tar file, even if the input format was different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'gzip'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always create a gzip file, even if the input format was different.

DONE.
