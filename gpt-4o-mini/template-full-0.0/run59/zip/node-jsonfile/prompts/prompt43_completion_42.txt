Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would serialize `null` instead of the actual object, leading to a JSON file containing `null` instead of the expected object representation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the object to a string representation (using the `toString` method) instead of serializing it to JSON, which may not be valid JSON and could cause errors when reading back the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...obj }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the object instead of serializing it to JSON, which could lead to unexpected results if the original object contains methods or non-serializable properties.

DONE.
