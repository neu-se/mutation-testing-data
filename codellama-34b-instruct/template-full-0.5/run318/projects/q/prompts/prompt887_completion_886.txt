  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` to get all the arguments, while this replacement code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)` to get all the arguments except the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` to get all the arguments, while this replacement code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 2)` to get all the arguments except the first two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` to get all the arguments, while this replacement code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 3)` to get all the arguments except the first three.
