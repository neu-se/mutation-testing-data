  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some string", str, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different file path to `fs.writeFileSync`, which could cause the function to write to a different file than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, "some string", options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different string to `stringify`, which could cause the function to produce a different output than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, "some string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different object to `fs.writeFileSync` as the `options` argument, which could cause the function to write to the file with different options than expected.

DONE.
