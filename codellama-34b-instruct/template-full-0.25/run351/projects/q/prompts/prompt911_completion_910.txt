  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs.reverse()` would reverse the order of the elements in the `baseArgs` array, which would likely cause the function to behave differently and potentially produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs.pop()` would remove the last element from the `baseArgs` array, which would likely cause the function to behave differently and potentially produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs.shift()` would remove the first element from the `baseArgs` array, which would likely cause the function to behave differently and potentially produce incorrect results.

DONE.
