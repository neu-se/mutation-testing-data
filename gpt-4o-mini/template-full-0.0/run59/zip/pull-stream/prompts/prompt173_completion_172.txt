Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` for any object, including non-array objects, which would allow objects to be processed as arrays, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat empty arrays as non-arrays, causing the code to attempt to convert them into keys, which would lead to an incorrect handling of empty arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` for all objects, including arrays, but would not specifically check for arrays, potentially allowing non-array objects to be processed incorrectly as if they were arrays.

DONE.
