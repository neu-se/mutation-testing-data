 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[resolvedPromise].concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an array with `resolvedPromise` and `args`, instead of passing `args` as additional arguments to the `promiseDispatch` method of `resolvedPromise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch(args)
