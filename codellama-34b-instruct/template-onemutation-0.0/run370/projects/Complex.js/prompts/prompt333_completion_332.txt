  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to `-1`, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is equal to `1`. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `b` is equal to `-1`, which would result in the `return` statement being executed and the function returning a different value.

DONE.
