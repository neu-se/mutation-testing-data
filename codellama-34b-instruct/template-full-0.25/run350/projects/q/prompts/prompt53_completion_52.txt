  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" &&
        process.toString() === "[object process]" && process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process` object is not defined in the browser, so the condition would evaluate to `false` and the `nextTick` function would not be used.
