  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are strings, while the new code fragment checks if both are numbers. This change would cause the code to behave differently when the `insert` property of an `Op` object is a number, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
