  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now matching carriage returns instead of line feeds, which could cause the `replace` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is now empty, which could cause the `replace` method to remove all line feeds from the input string instead of replacing them with the specified EOL character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is now a single space character, which could cause the `replace` method to replace all line feeds with a space character instead of the specified EOL character.

DONE.
