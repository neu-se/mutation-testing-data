  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This change will cause the `gettype` function to return "sublevel" if the link URL has more path parts than the page URL, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < 1
```
This change will cause the `gettype` function to return "uplevel" if the link URL has fewer path parts than the page URL, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != 1
```
This change will cause the `gettype` function to return "internal" if the link URL has the same number of path parts as the page URL, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
