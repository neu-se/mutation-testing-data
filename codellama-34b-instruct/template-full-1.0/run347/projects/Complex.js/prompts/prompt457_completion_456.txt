  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` when the original code returns `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.property = NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInfinite` method to return `true` when the original code returns `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.property = Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInfinite` method to return `true` when the original code returns `false`.

DONE.
