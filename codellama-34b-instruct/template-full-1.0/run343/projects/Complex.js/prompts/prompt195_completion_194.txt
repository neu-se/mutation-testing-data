  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function takes two arguments, but `(a, b)` does not have a function signature that matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function returns the value of `a` raised to the power of `b`, while `a * b` simply multiplies `a` and `b` together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function returns a complex number, while `1` is a real number.

DONE.
