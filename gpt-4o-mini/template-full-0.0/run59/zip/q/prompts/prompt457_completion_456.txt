Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly attempt to find the index of the promise in the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to potential errors in tracking unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the `unhandledRejections` array as the index, which is not a valid index and would likely cause an out-of-bounds error when trying to access elements in the `unhandledRejections` or `unhandledReasons` arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always refer to the first promise in the `unhandledRejections` array, ignoring the specific promise being untracked, which could lead to incorrect handling of multiple promises.

DONE.
