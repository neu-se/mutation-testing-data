  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with an error object, which would cause the read stream to emit an `error` event instead of a `close` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with a null value, which would cause the read stream to emit a `close` event without any error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with an undefined value, which would cause the read stream to emit a `close` event without any error.

DONE.
