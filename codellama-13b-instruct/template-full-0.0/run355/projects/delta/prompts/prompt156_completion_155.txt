  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` call to be skipped, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter.next()` call to be skipped, which could lead to incorrect results.
