  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.parent
```
This change will cause the `query` method to use the parent context of the current context instead of the current context, which may result in different behavior for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.child
```
This change will cause the `query` method to use the child context of the current context instead of the current context, which may result in different behavior for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.sibling
```
This change will cause the `query` method to use the sibling context of the current context instead of the current context, which may result in different behavior for certain inputs.

DONE.
