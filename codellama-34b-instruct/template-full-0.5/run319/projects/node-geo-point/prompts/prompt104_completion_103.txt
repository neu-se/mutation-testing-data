  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.floor` rounds down. This could potentially cause the tile coordinates to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.floor` rounds down. This could potentially cause the tile coordinates to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, whereas `Math.floor` rounds down. This could potentially cause the tile coordinates to be incorrect.

DONE.
