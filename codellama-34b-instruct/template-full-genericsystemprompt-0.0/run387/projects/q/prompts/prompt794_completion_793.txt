  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to the `then` method, which could potentially cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to the `then` method, which could potentially cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to the `then` method, which could potentially cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than expected.

DONE.
