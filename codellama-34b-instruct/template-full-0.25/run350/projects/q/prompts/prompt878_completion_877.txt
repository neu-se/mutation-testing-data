  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to be passed as the first argument to the `FS.readFile` function, rather than the last, which could cause unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to be removed from the array of arguments passed to the `FS.readFile` function, which could cause the function to not be called at all or to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas
