 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.size - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_flush` method to skip the last item in the queue if the queue size is greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the entire queue, discarding any pending write operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of the key-value pair before writing it to the write stream, potentially causing data inconsistency if the value is expected to remain unchanged.

DONE.
