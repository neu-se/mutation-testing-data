  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over one additional operation in the other iterator, potentially causing the algorithm to miss certain differences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the next `opLength - 1` operations in the other iterator, potentially causing the algorithm to miss certain differences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider twice as many operations in the other iterator, potentially causing the algorithm to detect false positives.

DONE.
