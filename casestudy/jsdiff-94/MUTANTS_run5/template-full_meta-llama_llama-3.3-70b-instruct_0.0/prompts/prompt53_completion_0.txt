Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline && noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now checking if `oldEOFNewline` is true and `noNlBeforeAdds` is true, instead of checking if `oldEOFNewline` is false and `noNlBeforeAdds` is true, which changes the logic of when to insert the 'No newline at end of file' marker.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!newEOFNewline && !noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now checking if `newEOFNewline` is false and `noNlBeforeAdds` is false, instead of checking if `oldEOFNewline` is false and `noNlBeforeAdds` is true, which changes the logic of when to insert the 'No newline at end of file' marker and also considers the state of the new file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline || !noNlBeforeAdds
```
This would result in different behavior
