  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```10 ^ places
```
This would result in different behavior because "Math.pow" is a function that returns the base 10 logarithm of a number, while "10 ^ places" is an exponentiation operator that raises 10 to the power of "places".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```places % 10
```
This would result in different behavior because "Math.pow" is a function that returns the base 10 logarithm of a number, while "places % 10" is the remainder of "places" divided by 10.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```places << 10
```
This would result in different behavior because "Math.pow" is a function that returns the base 10 logarithm of a number, while "places << 10" is a bitwise left shift operation that shifts the bits of "places" 10 positions to the left
