  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `replacer` is a function that is called with the object being stringified as an argument. However, if we replace it with `replacer || null`, we are essentially saying that if `replacer` is not defined, then use `null` instead. This would cause the `JSON.stringify()` method to use the default replacer function, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
