  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFileSync` function would now accept an additional argument `null`, which would cause the function to throw an error if the `file` argument is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFileSync` function would now accept an additional argument `undefined`, which would cause the function to throw an error if the `file` argument is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFileSync` function would now accept an additional argument `1`, which would cause the function to throw an error if the `file` argument is not a string.

DONE.
