  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Database could not be loaded')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a custom error message instead of a load event with a size of 0, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a load event with a negative size, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a load event with a size that is one more than the actual size of the data, which could cause the application to behave differently.

DONE.
