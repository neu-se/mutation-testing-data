  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current = result[country].current || []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=` operator would assign a new value to the `result[country].current` property, whereas the original code used `Object.assign()` to merge the new value with the existing one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current = Object.values(result[country])[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the first value of the `result[country]` object to the `result[country].current` property, whereas the original code used `Object.assign()` to merge the new value with the existing one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current = result[country].current.concat([id])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the new value with the existing `result[country].current` property, whereas the original code used `Object.assign()` to
