Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element in the slice, potentially leading to incorrect operations being applied to the base Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access an invalid index in the base Delta, which could lead to errors or unexpected results when processing the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the index, causing the method to skip over half of the elements in the base Delta, leading to incorrect transformations or omissions of operations.

DONE.
