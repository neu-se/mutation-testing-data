  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, whereas the original `===` operator checks for equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x == y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality without considering the type of the variables, whereas the original `===` operator checks for equality and also considers the type of the variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks for greater than, whereas the original `===` operator checks for equality.

DONE.
