  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because `channel.port1` and `channel.port2` are different ports, and `postMessage` is a method that sends a message to the port. Using `channel.port1.postMessage` instead of `channel.port2.postMessage` would cause the message to be sent to a different port, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `postMessage` takes a message as an argument, and passing `0` as the message would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `postMessage` takes a message as an argument, and passing `undefined` as the message would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
