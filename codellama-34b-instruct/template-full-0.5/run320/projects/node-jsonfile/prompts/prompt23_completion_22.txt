  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.trim()` would remove any whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the string, while `content` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toLowerCase()` would convert the string to lowercase, while `content` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.split('')` would split the string into an array of individual characters, while `content` would not.

DONE.
