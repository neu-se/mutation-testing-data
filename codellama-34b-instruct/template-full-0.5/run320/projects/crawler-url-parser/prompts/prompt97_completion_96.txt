  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `currentUrl` is truthy, even if `currentUrl.url` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrl && currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `currentUrl` is falsy, even if `currentUrl.url` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && !currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `currentUrl` is truthy and `currentUrl.url` is falsy.

DONE.
