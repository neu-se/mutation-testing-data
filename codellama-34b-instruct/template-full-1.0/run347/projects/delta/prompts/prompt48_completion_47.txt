  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always enter the `if` block, even if `embedType` is not equal to `Object.keys(b)[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only enter the `if` block if `embedType` is not a string, even if it is not equal to `Object.keys(b)[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!embedType
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only enter the `if` block if `embedType` is falsy, even if it is not equal to `Object.keys(b)[0]`.

DONE.
