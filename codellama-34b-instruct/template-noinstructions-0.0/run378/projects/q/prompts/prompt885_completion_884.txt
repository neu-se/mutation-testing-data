  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `nodeArgs` except the first one, whereas `nodeArgs` is expected to be an array of arguments to be passed to the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` would return a new array containing all elements of `nodeArgs` followed by the result of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, whereas `nodeArgs` is expected to be an array of arguments to be passed to the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` would add the result of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to the end of `nodeArgs`, whereas `nodeArgs` is expected to
