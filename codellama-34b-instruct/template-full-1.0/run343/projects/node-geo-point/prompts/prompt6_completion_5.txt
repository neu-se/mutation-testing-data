  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `isObject` function returned `true` for the provided argument, but this new code fragment would always return `true` regardless of the input because it is checking if the `coordinates` property is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type = 'Feature'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting the `type` property of the input object to be `'Point'`, but this new code fragment would set it to `'Feature'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0] = Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `coordinates` array had a length of 2, but this new code fragment would replace the first element of the array with a random number.

DONE.
