 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation in the first delta instead of the next operation in the second delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a length of 0, which could cause the loop to exit prematurely or continue indefinitely depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a length of Infinity, which could cause the loop to never exit or continue indefinitely depending on the input.

DONE.
