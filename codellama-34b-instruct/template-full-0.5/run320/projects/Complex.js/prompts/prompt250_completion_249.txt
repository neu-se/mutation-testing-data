  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
