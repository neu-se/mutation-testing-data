Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the absolute value of the latitude instead of converting degrees to radians, which would lead to incorrect calculations for bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the result of converting degrees to radians, which would distort the angle and yield incorrect bearing calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it divides the latitude by 2 instead of converting it to radians, which would significantly alter the bearing calculation and produce incorrect results.

DONE.
