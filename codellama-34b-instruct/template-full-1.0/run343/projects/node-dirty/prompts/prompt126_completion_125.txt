  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_end'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'write_end' is a different event that is emitted by the WriteStream when it is closed, whereas 'write_close' is emitted when the WriteStream is closed and the underlying file descriptor is released.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'error' is a different event that is emitted by the WriteStream when an error occurs, whereas 'write_close' is emitted when the WriteStream is closed, regardless of whether an error occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'drain' is a different event that is emitted by the WriteStream when the buffer is fully flushed to the underlying system, whereas 'write_close' is emitted when the WriteStream is closed and the underlying file descriptor is released.

DONE.
