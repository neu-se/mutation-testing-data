  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.length` would return the number of elements in the array, whereas `this._data.size` would return the number of elements in the array that have been assigned a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.size + 1` would return a value that is one greater than the number of elements in the array that have been assigned a value, whereas `this._data.size` would return the number of elements in the array that have been assigned a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.size - 1` would return a value that is one less than the number of elements in the array that have been assigned a value, whereas `this._data.size` would
