  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-zA-Z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match uppercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match a wider range of characters.

DONE.
