  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 1, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of `then()` would be `void 1` instead of `void 0`, which would cause the callback function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of `then()` would be `null` instead of `void 0`, which would cause the callback function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of `then()` would be `undefined` instead of `void 0`, which would cause the callback function to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
