  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy.name` property is being used as both the key and value in the map, whereas the original code fragment uses the `policy` object as the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name.toUpperCase()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy.name` property is being used as both the key and value in the map, whereas the original code fragment uses the `policy` object as the value. Additionally, the `toUpperCase()` method is being called on the `policy.name` property, which could result in different behavior if the `policy.name` property is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name.split('').reverse().join('')]
```
This would result in different
