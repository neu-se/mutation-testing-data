  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null)` would create a new deferred object with a null value, which would cause the `dispatch` method to return a promise that is resolved with a null value, rather than the expected promise that is resolved with the result of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(undefined)` would create a new deferred object with an undefined value, which would cause the `dispatch` method to return a promise that is resolved with an undefined value, rather than the expected promise that is resolved with the result of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(Math.random())
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(Math.random())` would create a new deferred object with a random value, which would cause the `dispatch` method to return a promise that is resolved with a
