  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the letter "j" or "J" instead of "i" or "I", which would cause the code to interpret the input string differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== 'i' && tokens[i + 1] !== 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the absence of the letter "i" or "I" instead of their presence, which would cause the code to interpret the input string differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I' || tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different
