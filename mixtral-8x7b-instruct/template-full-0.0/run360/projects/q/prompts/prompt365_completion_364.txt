 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable would always be falsy, and the `deferred.resolve(_rejected(exception))` line would never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve(_rejected(exception))` line would always be executed, even if `done` was true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
