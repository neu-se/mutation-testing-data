  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise with a new error object, while the modified code fragment would reject the promise with the original exception object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise with the exception object, while the modified code fragment would throw the exception object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise with the exception object, while the modified code fragment would reject the promise with the exception object wrapped in a new error object.

DONE.
