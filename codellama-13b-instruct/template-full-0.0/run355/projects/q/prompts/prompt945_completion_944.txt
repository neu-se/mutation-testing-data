  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be modified, which could affect the behavior of the `Q.nfbind` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be modified, which could affect the behavior of the `Q.nfbind` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.splice(0, 0, deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be modified, which could affect the behavior of the `Q.nfbind` function.

DONE.
