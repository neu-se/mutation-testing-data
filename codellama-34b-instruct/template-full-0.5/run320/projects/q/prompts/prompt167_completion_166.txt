  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length
```
This would result in an infinite loop, as the loop condition would never be met.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < lines.length - 1
```
This would result in a loop that would always skip the last element of the `lines` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= lines.length
```
This would result in a loop that would always exit immediately, as the condition would be met from the start.

DONE.
