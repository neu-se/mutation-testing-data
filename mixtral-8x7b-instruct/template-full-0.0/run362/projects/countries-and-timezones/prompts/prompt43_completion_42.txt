 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev, { [id]: { ...buildCountry(data, id) } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `buildCountry` result instead of directly assigning the `getCountry` result. This might cause issues if the original code relies on modifying the returned object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev, { [id]: getCountry('wrongId', options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `getCountry` with a wrong id, which might return a different country object or even an error, depending on the actual implementation of `getCountry`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev, { [id]: { ...getCountry(id, options), timezones: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `getCountry` result and overrides its `timezones` property with an
