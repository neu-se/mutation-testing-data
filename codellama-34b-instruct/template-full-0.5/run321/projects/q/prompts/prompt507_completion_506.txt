  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would be called with only one argument, which is not a valid way to call the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would be called with only one argument, which is not a valid way to call the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would be called with the first element of the `value` array as the `this` argument, which is not the same as the original code where `value` is used as the `this` argument.

DONE.
