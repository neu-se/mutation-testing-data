Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("rejectionHandled", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the "rejectionHandled" event instead of the "unhandledRejection" event, which would misrepresent the state of the promise handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs the unhandled rejection to the console instead of emitting an event, which means that the promise's rejection would not be tracked by any listeners that rely on the event system.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the `reason` parameter when emitting the "unhandledRejection" event, which means that the reason for the rejection would not be communicated to any listeners.

DONE.
