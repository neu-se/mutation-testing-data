 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/[^/]:|:\/|:$/.test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `test` method instead of `match`, which returns a boolean indicating whether the regular expression finds a match in the specified string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `match` method on the `spec` property of the current object, rather than on the `spec` parameter of the constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
spec.match(new RegExp('[^/]:|:\\/|:$'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new `RegExp` object with the same pattern, but with a different regular expression flag (`g` is added implicitly). This could lead to unexpected results if the
