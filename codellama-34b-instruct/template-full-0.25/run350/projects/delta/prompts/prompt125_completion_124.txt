  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.peek();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next value in the iterator without advancing it, whereas the `next` method returns the next value and advances the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method returns the next value and advances the iterator, whereas the `peek` method returns the next value without advancing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.next(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method returns the next value and advances the iterator by the specified number of steps, whereas the `peek` method returns the next value without advancing it.

DONE.
