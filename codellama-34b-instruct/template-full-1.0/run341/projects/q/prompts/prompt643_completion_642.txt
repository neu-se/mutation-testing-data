  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different method name than "post", and may not be supported by the object or its dispatch method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a different method name than "post", and may not be supported by the object or its dispatch method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "apply" is a different method name than "post", and may not be supported by the object or its dispatch method.

DONE.
