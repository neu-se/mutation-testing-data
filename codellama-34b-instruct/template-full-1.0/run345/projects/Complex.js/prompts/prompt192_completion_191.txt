```
new Complex(Math.log(Math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)), Math.atan2(b, a));
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the complex number's argument has been altered from `Math.atan2(b, a)` to `Math.log(Math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2))` which is not equivalent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(Math.exp(Math.pow(a**2 + b**2, 0.5)), Math.atan2(b, a));
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the complex number's modulus has been altered from `Math.exp(Math.pow(a**2 + b**2, 0.5))` to `Math.log(Math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2))` which is not equivalent.
