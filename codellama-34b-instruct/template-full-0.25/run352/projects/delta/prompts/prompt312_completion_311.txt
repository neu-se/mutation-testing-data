  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip every other line in the document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `eachLine` method to only iterate over every other line in the document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable would always be set to 0, which would cause the `eachLine` method to always iterate over the first line in the document.

DONE.
