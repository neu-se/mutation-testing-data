  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` retrieves the first element of the array, while `pop` retrieves the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` changes the content of the array, while `shift` and `pop` only retrieve elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `length = 0` sets the length of the array to 0, removing all elements, while `shift` and `pop` only remove the first or last element.
