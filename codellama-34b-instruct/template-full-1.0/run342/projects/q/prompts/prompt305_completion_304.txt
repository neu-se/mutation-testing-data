  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += Math.random();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i += Math.random()` expression increments `i` by a random number, while the original `i++` expression increments `i` by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i--` expression decrements `i` by 1, while the original `i++` expression increments `i` by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i *= 2` expression multiplies `i` by 2, while the original `i++` expression increments `i` by 1.

DONE.
