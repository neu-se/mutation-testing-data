Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality of the `insert` properties, which may not account for cases where the two objects are equal in value but not in reference, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in the diffing process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the equality check, meaning that the code would now push the operation to `retDelta` when the inserts are not equal, which is the opposite of the intended logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain !== otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the `retain` properties instead of the `insert` properties, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations that should be treated as equal based on their `insert` values, thus affecting the diffing logic.

DONE.
