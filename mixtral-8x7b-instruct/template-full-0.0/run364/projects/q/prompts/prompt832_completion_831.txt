 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `this.then()` should be a function, but instead, a boolean value is being passed, which would throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is not a function, and therefore, passing it as the second argument to `this.then()` would throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
