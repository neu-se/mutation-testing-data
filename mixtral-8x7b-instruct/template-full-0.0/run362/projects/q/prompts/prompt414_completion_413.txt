 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function would return true for all objects, including non-promise objects, which could cause unexpected results in other parts of the code that rely on this function to correctly identify promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function would return false for all objects, including promises, which could cause other parts of the code that rely on this function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ then: function() {} }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function would consider any object with a `then` method to be a promise, even if it doesn't have the other properties and methods expected of a promise. This could cause unexpected results in other parts of the code that rely on this function to correctly identify promises.

DONE.
