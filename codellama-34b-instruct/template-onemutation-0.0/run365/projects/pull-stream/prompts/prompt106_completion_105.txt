  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function that takes no arguments, while the new code fragment `done(null)` is a function call with an argument `null`. This change would cause the test to fail if the function `onEnd` is not designed to handle the case where the argument is `null`.
