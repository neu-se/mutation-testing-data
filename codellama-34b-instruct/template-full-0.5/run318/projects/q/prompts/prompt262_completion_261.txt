  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is called with `value`, which is not the same as `reason` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is called with `reason`, which is not the same as `value` in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is called with `reason`, which is not the same as `value` in the original code.

DONE.
