  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `b[key]` with `b[key]` instead of comparing it with `a[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `a[key]` before comparing it with `b[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `a[key]` by 2 before comparing it with `b[key]`.

DONE.
