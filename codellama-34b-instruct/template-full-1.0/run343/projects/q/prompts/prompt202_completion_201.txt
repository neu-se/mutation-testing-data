  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[1].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the second line instead of the first line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[lines.length - 1].indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the last line instead of the first line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines.join().indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the joined string of all lines instead of the first line.

DONE.
