  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to skip over certain operations or return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to return incorrect results or throw an error if the argument is out of bounds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to return incorrect results or throw an error if the argument is out of bounds.

DONE.
