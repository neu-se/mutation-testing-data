Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.peek().attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `iter.peek()` instead of `iter.next(1)`, which means it does not advance the iterator and may lead to incorrect processing of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the index `i` by 1 regardless of whether the predicate was called, potentially causing incorrect line counting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || { color: 'red' }, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it provides a default attribute of `{ color: 'red' }` instead of using the actual attributes from the operation, which could lead to incorrect attribute handling in the resulting Delta.

DONE.
