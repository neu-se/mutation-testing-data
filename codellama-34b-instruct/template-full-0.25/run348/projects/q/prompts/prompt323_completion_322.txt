  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `args` array as the second argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, instead of passing the `args` array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array without its first element as the second argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, instead of passing the `args` array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args.concat(args[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a new array that is the concatenation of the `args` array and its first element, instead of passing the `args` array itself.

DONE.
