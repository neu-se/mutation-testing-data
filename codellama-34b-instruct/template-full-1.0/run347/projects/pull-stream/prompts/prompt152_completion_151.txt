  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes `_value` as the second argument to `cb`, but this modified code fragment passes `_value` twice, which would cause `cb` to be called with an incorrect number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `_value` as the second argument to `cb`, but this modified code fragment passes `_value + 1`, which would cause `cb` to be called with a different second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, otherValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `_value` as the second argument to `cb`, but this modified code fragment passes `otherValue`, which is a different variable that may have a different value than `_value`.

DONE.
