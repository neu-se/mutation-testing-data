 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(2, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the base of the exponentiation is changed from 10 to 2, which would significantly alter the output values for the `ceil`, `floor`, and `round` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places !== undefined ? Math.pow(10, places) : 10
```
This would result in different behavior because if `places` is undefined, it would default to 10 instead of 1, which would affect the precision of the output values for the `ceil`, `floor`, and `round` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because if `places` is 0 or a falsy value, it would default to 1 instead of 10, which would affect the precision of the output values for the `ceil
