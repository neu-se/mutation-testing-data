  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called directly, bypassing the checks for different environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be called, causing the code to enter an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (x) { return x*x; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be replaced with a square function, causing the code to produce different output.

DONE.
