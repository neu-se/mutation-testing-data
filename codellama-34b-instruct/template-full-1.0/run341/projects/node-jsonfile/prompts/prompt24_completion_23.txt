  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse.call(obj, content, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `JSON.parse` on the `obj` object, which may not be a valid JSON string, causing an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `JSON.parse` on the `content` variable, which may not be a valid JSON string, causing an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver || [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `JSON.parse` on the `content` variable with the `reviver` option set to an empty array, which may not be the same as the default behavior of `JSON.parse`.

DONE.
