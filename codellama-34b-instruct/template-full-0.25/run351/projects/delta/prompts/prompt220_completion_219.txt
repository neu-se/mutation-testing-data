  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code to execute the `insert` block when `op.insert` is `null`, and the `retain` block when `op.insert` is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code to execute the `retain` block when `op.insert` is `null`, and the `insert` block when `op.insert` is not `null`.
