  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `seen` check, causing the filter to return `true` for items that have already been seen, rather than `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `seen` flag to `false` for the current item, regardless of whether it has already been seen or not. This would cause the filter to return `true` for all items, regardless of whether they have already been seen or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = !seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the `seen` flag for the current item, causing the filter to return `true` for items that have already been seen, and `false` for items that have not been seen.

DONE.
