  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` operation to always retain zero characters, regardless of the length of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` operation to always retain one character less than the length of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` operation to randomly retain a number of characters between 0 and the length of the operation.

DONE.
