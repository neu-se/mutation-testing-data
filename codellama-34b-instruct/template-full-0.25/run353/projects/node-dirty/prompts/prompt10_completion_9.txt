  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the path to lowercase, which could potentially cause the code to read from a different file or directory than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the path into an array of strings using `/` as the delimiter, and the `pop()` method would remove the last element of the array, which could potentially cause the code to read from a different file or directory than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace all occurrences of `/` in the path with an empty string, which could potentially cause the code to read from a different file or directory than intended.

DONE.
