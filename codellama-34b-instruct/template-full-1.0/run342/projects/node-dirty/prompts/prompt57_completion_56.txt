  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'end'` event is emitted when the write stream has been closed, whereas the `'drain'` event is emitted when the write stream's internal buffer is empty and it is ready to accept more data. Using `'end'` instead of `'drain'` would cause the database to be closed prematurely, potentially resulting in data loss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'error'` event is emitted when there is an error in the write stream, whereas the `'drain'` event is emitted when the write stream's internal buffer is empty and it is ready to accept more data. Using `'error'` instead of `'drain'` would cause the database to be closed when an error occurs, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', ()
