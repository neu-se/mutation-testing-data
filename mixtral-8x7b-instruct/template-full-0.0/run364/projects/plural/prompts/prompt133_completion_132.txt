 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the test for a regular expression match is replaced with a test for a string equality, which would always fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the test for a regular expression match is replaced with a test for string equality of the regular expression's string representation, which would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the test for a regular expression match is replaced with a test for the result of the exec method, which would return an array if there is a match, or null if there is no match.

DONE.
