  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` argument is not passed to the `nfapply` method, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` argument is sliced, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args.concat([deferred.makeNodeResolver()]))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` argument is concatenated with an extra argument, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
