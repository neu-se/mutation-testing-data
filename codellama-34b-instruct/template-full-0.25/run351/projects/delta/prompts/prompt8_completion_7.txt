  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is not null, while this new code fragment checks if the value is null. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the value is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is not null, while this new code fragment checks if the value is not undefined. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the value is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is not null, while this new code fragment checks if the value is undefined. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where the value is undefined.

DONE.
