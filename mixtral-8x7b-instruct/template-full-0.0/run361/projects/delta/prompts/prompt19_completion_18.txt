 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns only the own enumerable and non-enumerable properties of an object, while `Object.keys` returns only the own enumerable properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['constructor', ...Object.keys(b)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes the `constructor` property of the object, which is not included in the original `Object.keys(a).concat(Object.keys(b))`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.ownKeys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Reflect.ownKeys` returns all own keys of an object, including symbols, while `Object.keys` returns only the own enumerable string properties.

DONE.
