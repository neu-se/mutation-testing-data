  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `array_slice(arguments)`, which slices the `arguments` object from the beginning to the end, while the new code fragment slices the `arguments` object from the second argument to the end, effectively removing the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `array_slice(arguments)`, which slices the `arguments` object from the beginning to the end, while the new code fragment slices the `arguments` object from the beginning to the first argument, effectively removing all but the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `array_slice(arguments)`, which slices the `arguments` object
