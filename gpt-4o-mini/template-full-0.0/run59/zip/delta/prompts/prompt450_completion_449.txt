Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly classify an operation with a `retain` property that is a number or an object as not being a 'retain' type, potentially causing the `peekType` method to return 'insert' or 'delete' instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only classify `retain` as valid if it is a positive number, thus excluding valid `retain` values of zero, which may lead to incorrect handling of operations that should be retained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would classify any operation with a `retain` property that is explicitly set to `null` as a 'retain' type, which contradicts the original logic that checks for a number or a non-null object, leading to potential misclassification of operations.

DONE.
