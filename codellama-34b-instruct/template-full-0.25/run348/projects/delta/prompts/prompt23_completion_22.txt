  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of the same key in both objects, rather than comparing the value of the key in the first object to the value of the key in the second object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of the same key in both objects, rather than comparing the value of the key in the first object to the value of the key in the second object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of the same key in both objects, rather than comparing the value of the key in the first object to the value of the key in the second object.

DONE.
