  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of the `key` variable as the second argument to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing the `key` variable itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of the `key` variable plus 1 as the second argument to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing the `key` variable itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of the `key` variable minus 1 as the second argument to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing the `key` variable itself.

DONE.
