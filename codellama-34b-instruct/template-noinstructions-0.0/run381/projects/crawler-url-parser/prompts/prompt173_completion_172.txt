  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log the message to the console with a higher level of priority than `console.log`, which could potentially cause the message to be more noticeable to the user.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.warn` would log the message to the console with a higher level of priority than `console.log`, which could potentially cause the message to be more noticeable to the user.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.info` would log the message to the console with a lower level of priority than `console.log`, which could potentially cause the message to be less noticeable to the user.

DONE.
