Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection reason would not be tracked properly, leading to unhandled rejections being reported without a valid reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` as the reason would cause the stack trace to be recorded as "(no stack) null", which may not provide useful information for debugging unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Custom error message"
```
This would result in different behavior because a static string would be used as the rejection reason instead of the actual reason passed to the `reject` function, potentially obscuring the real cause of the rejection.

DONE.
