  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that indicates that no more data will be written to the stream, whereas `destroy()` is a method that destroys the stream, making it no longer usable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` can take an error object as an argument, which would be emitted as an error event on the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('Test data')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` is a method that writes data to the stream, whereas `end()` and `destroy()` are methods that indicate the end of the stream.

DONE.
