  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `error` is a function that will be invoked when the error occurs, while `error` is just an object that contains information about the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that will be coerced to a string when passed to `nodeback`, while `error` is an object that has its own `toString()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` creates a new error object, which will have a different message and stack trace than the original error object.

DONE.
