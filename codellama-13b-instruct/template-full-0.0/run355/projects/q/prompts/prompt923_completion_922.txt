  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fapply` method to apply the callback function to the given arguments, while the buggy code fragment uses the `fapply` method to apply the callback function to the given arguments, which would result in the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fapply` method to apply the callback function to the given arguments, while the buggy code fragment uses the `fapply` method to apply the callback function to the given arguments, which would result in the same behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fapply` method to apply the callback function to the given arguments, while the
