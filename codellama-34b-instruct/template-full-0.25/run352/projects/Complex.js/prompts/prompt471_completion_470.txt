  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if it is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['im']) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if it is within a small tolerance of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0 && this['re'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if both the imaginary and real parts are equal to 0.

DONE.
