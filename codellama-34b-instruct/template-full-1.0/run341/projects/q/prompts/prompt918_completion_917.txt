  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to be called twice, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to be called immediately, rather than when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to be called with `null` as the argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
