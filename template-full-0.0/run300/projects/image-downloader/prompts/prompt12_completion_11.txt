  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` returns the full pathname, while the new code fragment `pathname.split('/').pop()` returns only the last component of the pathname.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` returns the full pathname, while the new code fragment `pathname.replace(/\//g, '')` returns the pathname with all forward slashes removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').slice(-1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` returns the full pathname, while the new code fragment `pathname.split('/').slice(-1)[0]` returns only the last component of the pathname, but using a different method.
