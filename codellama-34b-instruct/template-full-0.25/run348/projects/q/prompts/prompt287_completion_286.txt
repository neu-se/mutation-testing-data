  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise` is a different object than `defer`, and it may not have the same methods or properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, whereas `defer` is an object that contains the promise and other methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.reject` is a function that rejects the promise, whereas `defer` is an object that contains the promise and other methods.

DONE.
