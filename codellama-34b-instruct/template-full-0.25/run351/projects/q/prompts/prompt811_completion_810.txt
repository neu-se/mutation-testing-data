  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, but in this case, it is not being passed any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, but in this case, it is not being passed any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the first argument, and the arguments passed to the new function are passed to the original function.

DONE.
