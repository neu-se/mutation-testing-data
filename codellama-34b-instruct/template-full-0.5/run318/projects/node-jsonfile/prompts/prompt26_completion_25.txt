  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.replacer
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.replacer` is a different property than `options.reviver`, and it is used to specify a function that transforms the results of the JSON parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver = function(key, value) { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `reviver` function to a no-op function that simply returns the value unchanged, whereas the original code uses a different function to revive the JSON data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver = function(key, value) { return value * 2; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `reviver` function to a function that doubles the value of the JSON data, whereas the original code uses a different function to revive the JSON data.

DONE.
