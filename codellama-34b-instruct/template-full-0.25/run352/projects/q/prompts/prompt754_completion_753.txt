  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `any` function would return a rejected promise with an error message indicating that all promises were rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the `any` function would return a rejected promise with an error message indicating that all promises were rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is a truthy value, and the `any` function would return a fulfilled promise with an array of the resolved values.

DONE.
