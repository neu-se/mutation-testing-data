  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a JavaScript keyword that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise. Using `throw` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with an exception, which would result in different behavior in the surrounding code.
