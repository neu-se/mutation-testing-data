  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the last segment of the path, while the new code fragment captures the first segment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the last segment of the path, while the new code fragment captures the first segment and the trailing slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the last segment of the path, while the new code fragment captures the first segment and the trailing slash, and the `?` makes the trailing slash optional.

DONE.
