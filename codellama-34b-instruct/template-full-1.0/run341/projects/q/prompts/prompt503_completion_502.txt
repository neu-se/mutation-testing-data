  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void` keyword would not be used, and the `null` value would be included in the `args` array, which could affect the behavior of the code that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `NaN` value is not the same as `null`, and would likely cause the code that uses it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not the same as `null`, and would likely cause the code that uses it to behave differently.

DONE.
