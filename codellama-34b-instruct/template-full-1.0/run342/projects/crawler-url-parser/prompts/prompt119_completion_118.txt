  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `href` is a property of the `baseUrl` object, and it may contain a different value than `baseUrl` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `protocol` is a property of the `baseUrl` object, and it may contain a different value than `baseUrl` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `host` is a property of the `baseUrl` object, and it may contain a different value than `baseUrl` itself.

DONE.
