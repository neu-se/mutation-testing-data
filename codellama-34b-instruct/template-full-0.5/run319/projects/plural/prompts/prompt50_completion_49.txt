  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed, which would cause the regex to match only lowercase letters, whereas the original regex would match both lowercase and uppercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which would cause the regex to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, whereas the original regex would only match the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which would cause the regex to match both uppercase and lowercase letters, whereas the original regex would only match lowercase letters.

DONE.
