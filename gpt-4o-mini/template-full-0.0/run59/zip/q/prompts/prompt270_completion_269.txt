Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + " error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the reason by appending a string, which changes the error message and may affect how the rejection is handled by any attached error handlers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the reason would indicate a rejection without a specific reason, which could lead to confusion or improper handling of the rejection in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` as the reason would also indicate a rejection without a specific reason, similar to `null`, but could lead to different interpretations in the context of promise handling, especially if the error handling logic expects a defined value.

DONE.
