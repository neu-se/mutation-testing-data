  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the arguments `(aborted)` when the `aborted` variable is truthy. In contrast, the new code fragment `abortCb(aborted)` calls the `abortCb` function with the argument `aborted`, which is a function that takes a single argument. This would result in a type error if `abortCb` is not a function that takes a single argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err, aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is called with the arguments `(err, data)` when the `err` variable is truthy. In contrast, the new code fragment `abortCb(err, aborted)` calls the `abortCb` function with the arguments `err` and `aborted`, which are both variables that
