  DONE. My answers are:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is truthy, while the mutated code sets `end` to `null`, which is falsy, making the if statement always evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > max - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `i` is greater than `max`, while the mutated code checks if `i` is greater than `max - 1`, which changes the boundary condition for the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `i` is greater than `max`, which is `Infinity` by default, while the mutated code sets `max` to `0`, making the loop never executed.
