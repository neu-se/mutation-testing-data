  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `untrackRejection` function with the current promise and the reason for rejection, which would remove the promise from the list of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `untrackRejection` function with only the reason for rejection, which would remove the promise from the list of unhandled rejections but would not provide the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `untrackRejection` function with only the current promise, which would remove the promise from the list of unhandled rejections but would not provide the reason for rejection.

DONE.
