  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name == null
```
This would result in different behavior because == performs a type coercion before checking for equality, so name==null would return true if name is undefined or null, while name===null would only return true if name is strictly equal to null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is a non-null value that would return true for the strict equality check, while null would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition, so it would only return true if name is not undefined or null, while the original condition would return true if name is only null.

DONE.
