 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Array.prototype.slice` with `call` to create a shallow copy of the arguments list, starting from the second argument, instead of using the `array_slice` utility function which might have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method of an empty array with `call` to create a shallow copy of the arguments list, starting from the second argument, instead of using the `array_slice` utility function which might have different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.slice(1)
