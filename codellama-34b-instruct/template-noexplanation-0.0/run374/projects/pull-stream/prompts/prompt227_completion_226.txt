  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This change will cause the `filterNot` function to always return the opposite of what it should, effectively negating the filter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This change will cause the `filterNot` function to always return `false`, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This change will cause the `filterNot` function to always return `true`, regardless of the input.

DONE.
