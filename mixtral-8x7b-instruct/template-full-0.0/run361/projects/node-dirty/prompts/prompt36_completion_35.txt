 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
... of this._data.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the entries (key-value pairs) instead of just keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
... of Array.from(this._data.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts keys to an array before iterating, which may affect performance and cause issues if the number of keys is large.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
... of Object.keys(this._data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the Map to an object with keys before iterating, which may cause issues due to the limitations of using objects as sets and the potential loss of key order.

DONE.
