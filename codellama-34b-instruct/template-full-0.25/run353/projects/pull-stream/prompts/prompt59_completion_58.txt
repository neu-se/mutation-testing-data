  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` if `abort` is truthy, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator returns the first truthy value, so if `abort` is truthy, the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator returns the first falsy value, so if `end` is falsy, the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `abort`.

DONE.
