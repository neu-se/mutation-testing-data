  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...options, deprecated: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `deprecated` property to `false`, even if it was already set to `true` in the original `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...options, deprecated: !options.deprecated }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the `deprecated` property between `true` and `false`, regardless of its original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...options, deprecated: options.deprecated ? false : true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `deprecated` property to `false` if it was already set to `true`, and vice versa.

DONE.
