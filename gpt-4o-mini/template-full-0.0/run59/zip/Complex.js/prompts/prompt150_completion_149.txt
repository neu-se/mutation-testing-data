Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, which would lead to incorrect results when multiplying an infinite complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for infinity, meaning that the condition would pass when the number is not infinite, potentially leading to incorrect handling of infinite values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines checks for both the current complex number being zero and the other complex number being infinite, which changes the logic of how infinite values are handled in multiplication.

DONE.
