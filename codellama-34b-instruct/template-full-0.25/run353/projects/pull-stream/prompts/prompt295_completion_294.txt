  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err && true` is always true if `err` is truthy, while `err || true` is always true if `err` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because `!err` is always true if `err` is falsy, while `err || true` is always true if `err` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because `err ? true : false` is always true if `err` is truthy, while `err || true` is always true if `err` is falsy.

DONE.
