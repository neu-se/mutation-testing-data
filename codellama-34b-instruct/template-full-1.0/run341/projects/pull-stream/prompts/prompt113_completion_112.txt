  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err) {
    cb(err, null);
} else {
    cb(null, acc);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `cb` with `err` and `acc` as arguments, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is truthy before calling `cb` with `err` and `null` as arguments. This would cause the function to behave differently when `err` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err) {
    cb(err, acc);
} else {
    cb(null, acc);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `cb` with `err` and `acc` as arguments, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is truthy before calling `cb` with `err` and `acc` as arguments.

Option 3
