  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` function would be called with a different event name, which could cause the event handler to not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` function would be called with a different event name, which could cause the event handler to not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'debug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` function would be called with a different event name, which could cause the event handler to not be triggered.

DONE.
