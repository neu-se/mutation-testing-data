  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the error argument to the `onUnhandledError` function, which would then throw an error and cause the program to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the error argument to the `onUnhandledError` function, which would then throw an error and cause the program to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be passed as the error argument to the `onUnhandledError` function, which would then throw an error and cause the program to crash.

DONE.
