  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret. href
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` property is not a valid string and will throw an error, whereas `ret.host` is a valid string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pathname` is a different property than `host` and would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.searchParams
```
This would result in different behavior because `searchParams` is a different property than `host` and would return a different result.

DONE.
