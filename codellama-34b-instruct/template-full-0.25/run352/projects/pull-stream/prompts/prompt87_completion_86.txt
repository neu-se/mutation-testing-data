  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb !== null` is always true, while `!cb` is only true when `cb` is falsey (i.e., null, undefined, 0, NaN, or an empty string).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof cb === 'function'` is only true when `cb` is a function, while `!cb` is true when `cb` is falsey.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb.length > 0` is only true when `cb` is a non-empty array, while `!cb` is true when `cb` is falsey.

DONE.
