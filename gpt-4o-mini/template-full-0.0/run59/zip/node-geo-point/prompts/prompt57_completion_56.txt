Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the latitude of the second point instead of the first point, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the latitude of the first point, which would distort the bearing calculation by artificially altering the latitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 - φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts the latitude of the second point from the first point, which would not correctly represent the intended calculation of the bearing between the two points.

DONE.
