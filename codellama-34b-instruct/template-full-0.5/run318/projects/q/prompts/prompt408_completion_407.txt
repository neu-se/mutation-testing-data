  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of the expression, so `!isPromise` would be `true` if `isPromise` is `false`, and `false` if `isPromise` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if an object is a promise-like object, which is not the same as checking if an object is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` checks if a promise is fulfilled, whereas `isPromise` checks if an object is a promise.

DONE.
