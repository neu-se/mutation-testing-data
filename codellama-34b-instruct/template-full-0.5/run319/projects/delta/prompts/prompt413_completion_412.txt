  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.nextLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextLength` is not a method of `OpIterator`, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` is a method of `OpIterator`, and would return the length of the next operation, rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of `OpIterator`, and would return the total length of all operations in the iterator, rather than the length of the current operation.

DONE.
