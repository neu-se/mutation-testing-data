 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method expects a value or a function, and an empty function would not propagate the resolved value from the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method expects a value or a function, and passing `null` would result in an error being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method expects a value or a function, and passing the `promises` variable would change the behavior of the promise chain.

DONE.
