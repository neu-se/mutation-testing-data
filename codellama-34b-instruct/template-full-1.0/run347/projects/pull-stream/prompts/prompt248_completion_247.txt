  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was passing `abort` as the first argument to `read`, while this code fragment would pass `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, function(err) {
  cb(err, null)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was passing `null` as the second argument to `read`, while this code fragment would pass a function that would call `cb` with `err` as the first argument and `null` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, function(err) {
  if (err) {
    return cb(err)
  }
  cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was passing `data` as the second argument to `cb`, while this code fragment would pass a function that
