 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
    return {};
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would be called on an empty object instead of the promise's state, causing incorrect or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
    return Q.resolve();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` is immediately fulfilled, causing the `all` method to resolve prematurely and not wait for the original promises to settle. This may lead to incorrect or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless(promise) {
    return promise.inspect();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function now accepts a parameter, which is not used in the original code. This change may cause unexpected behavior or errors if the `regardless` function is called with an argument in other parts of the
