  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the dollar sign (`$`) to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the caret (`^`) to match the start of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*#/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the dollar sign (`$`) to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the hash (`#`) to match the start of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*#/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the dollar sign (`$`) to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the caret (`^`) to match the start of the string, and the hash (`#`) to match the start of the string.

DONE.
