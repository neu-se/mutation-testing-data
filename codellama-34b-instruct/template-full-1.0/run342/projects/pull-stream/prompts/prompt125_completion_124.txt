  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current value of the variable `i`, which may be different from the original behavior that returns the `end` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the maximum value of the `max` parameter, instead of the `end` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a null value, instead of the original behavior that returns the `end` value.

DONE.
