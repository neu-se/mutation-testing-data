  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is not a function, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is not a function, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value)` is a promise that resolves to `value`, whereas `become(value)` would resolve to a promise that resolves to `value`.

DONE.
