  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` and `Math.floor` have different rounding behaviors, which could cause issues in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` and `Math.floor` have different rounding behaviors, which could cause issues in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.trunc` and `Math.floor` have different rounding behaviors, which could cause issues in certain situations.

DONE.
