  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `shouldThrow` is a boolean variable, and comparing it to `true` using the `===` operator will only return `true` if `shouldThrow` is already `true`. However, the original code fragment uses `shouldThrow` as a variable name, not a boolean value, so replacing it with `shouldThrow === true` would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, and it will invert the value of `shouldThrow`. If `shouldThrow` is `true`, then `!shouldThrow` will be `false`, and if `shouldThrow` is `false`, then `!shouldThrow` will be `true`. However, the original code fragment does not use the logical NOT operator, so replacing it with `!shouldThrow` would change the behavior of the code.
