  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` is a function that returns a new deferred object, whereas `defer` is a variable that references a deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable that references a deferred object, whereas `defer()` is a function that returns a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function that returns a new deferred object, whereas `defer` and `deferred` are variables that reference deferred objects.

DONE.
