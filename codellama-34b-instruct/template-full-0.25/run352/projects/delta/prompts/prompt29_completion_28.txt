  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert()
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.invert()` returns the inverted version of the `base` object, which is not the same as `base` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert(attr)
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.invert(attr)` returns the inverted version of the `attr` object, which is not the same as `base` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert(attr, base)
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.invert(attr, base)` returns the inverted version of the `attr` object, but with the `base` object as the context. This means that the resulting object will have a different set of properties than the original `base` object.

DONE.
