  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost(name, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).npost(name, args)` is a function call, while `Q(object).npost` is a property access.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost(name, args).bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).npost(name, args).bind(this)` is a bound function, while `Q(object).npost` is an unbound function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost(name, args).call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).npost(name, args).call(this)` is a function call with a specific `this` value, while `Q(object).npost` is a function call with the default `this` value.
