  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` parameter is replaced with `value`, which is not a property of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation is replaced with `set`, which would set the property to a new value instead of deleting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation is replaced with `get`, which would return the value of the property instead of deleting it.

DONE.
