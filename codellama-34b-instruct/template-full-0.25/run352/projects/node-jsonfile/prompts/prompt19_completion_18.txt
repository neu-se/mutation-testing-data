  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.toString()` would return a string representation of the `file` object, whereas `file` would return the `file` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.name` would return the name of the file, whereas `file` would return the `file` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.path` would return the path of the file, whereas `file` would return the `file` object itself.

DONE.
