  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the original string, which would change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the original string to uppercase, which would change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the original string into an array of individual characters, which would change the output of the function.

DONE.
