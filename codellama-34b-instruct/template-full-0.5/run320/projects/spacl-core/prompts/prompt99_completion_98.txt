  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `query` method with the `path`, `verb`, and `ctx` arguments, whereas the original code fragment only called the `query` method with the `path` and `verb` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `query` method with an additional `true` argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `query` method with an additional empty object argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the method.

DONE.
