  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last op in the delta, rather than the entire delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first op in the delta, rather than the entire delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second-to-last op in the delta, rather than the entire delta.

DONE.
