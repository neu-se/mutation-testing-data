Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `options.dest` is strictly `undefined`, which would allow for other falsy values (like an empty string) to pass through, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest && options.dest !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options.dest` is falsy and also explicitly checks if it is not an empty string, which could lead to a situation where an empty string is considered valid, contrary to the original intent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality to check for both `null` and `undefined`, which could allow for other falsy values (like `0` or `false`) to bypass the error check, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the `dest` option.

DONE.
