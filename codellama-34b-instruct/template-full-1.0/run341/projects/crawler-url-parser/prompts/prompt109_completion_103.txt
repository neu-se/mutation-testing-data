  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Map` instance to have a key of `currentUrl.url` and a value of `null`, which is different from the original code where the value is `currentUrl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl, baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Map` instance to have a key of `currentUrl` and a value of `baseUrl`, which is different from the original code where the value is `currentUrl`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Map` instance to have a key of `baseUrl` and a value of `null`, which is different from the original code where the value is `currentUrl`.

DONE.
