  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/dev/null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file stream would be piped to the null device instead of the specified destination file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/tmp/test.txt'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file stream would be piped to a temporary file instead of the specified destination file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/etc/passwd'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file stream would be piped to the system password file instead of the specified destination file.

DONE.
