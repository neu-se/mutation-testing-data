Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' && (priority || otherIter.peekType() === 'insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks for a 'delete' operation instead of 'insert', which would lead to retaining operations when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && (priority && otherIter.peekType() === 'delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to only retain when priority is true and the other operation is a 'delete', which could lead to incorrect transformations when both operations are 'insert'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert' || (priority && otherIter.peekType() === 'insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a logical OR instead of AND, which would allow for retaining operations even when the current operation is not an 'insert', potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
