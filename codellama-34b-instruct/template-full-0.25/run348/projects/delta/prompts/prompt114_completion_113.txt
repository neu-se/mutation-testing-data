  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is not being applied to the current element, and the accumulator is not being updated correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is not being applied to the current element, and the accumulator is not being updated correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is not being applied to the current element, and the accumulator is not being updated correctly.

DONE.
