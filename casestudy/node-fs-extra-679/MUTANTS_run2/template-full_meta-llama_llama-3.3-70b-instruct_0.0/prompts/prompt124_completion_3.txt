Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(new Error('Unexpected error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an error that is not handled by the existing error handling mechanisms, potentially causing the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null, srcStat)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the `srcStat` instead of not passing any arguments to the callback, potentially causing the program to process incorrect data or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an unnecessary `return` statement, potentially causing the function to exit prematurely and skip any subsequent code, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
