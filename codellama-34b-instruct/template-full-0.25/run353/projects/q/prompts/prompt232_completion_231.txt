  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[2]` would refer to the third argument passed to the `promiseDispatch` method, which is not the same as `operands[1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[0]` would refer to the first argument passed to the `promiseDispatch` method, which is not the same as `operands[1]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands.length` would refer to the number of arguments passed to the `promiseDispatch` method, which is not the same as `operands[1]`.

DONE.
