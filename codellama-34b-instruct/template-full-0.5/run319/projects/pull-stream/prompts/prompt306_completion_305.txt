  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to `end`, regardless of its previous value, which could cause the function to terminate prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `ended` to the negation of `end`, which could cause the function to continue running even after it should have terminated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end && !last
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `ended` to `true` only if `end` is `true` and `last` is `false`, which could cause the function to terminate prematurely if `last` is `true`.

DONE.
