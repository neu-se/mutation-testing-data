  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `undefined` instead of the function `array_slice`, which is used to create a copy of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a bound function that is bound to the `array_slice` function, but it would not work as expected because the `array_slice` function is not a method on the `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `array_slice` method on the `Q` object, which is not defined.

DONE.
