  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not calling the `nextStream` function, but instead was referring to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, nextStream)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not passing `nextStream` as a callback to `_read`, but instead was calling it directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function() { nextStream(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not creating a new function to call `nextStream`, but instead was calling it directly.

DONE.
