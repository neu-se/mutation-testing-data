  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to decrease by `length`, potentially skipping over important operations in the `base` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to increase by `length + 1`, potentially skipping over important operations in the `base` Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to increase by `length * 2`, potentially skipping over important operations in the `base` Delta.

DONE.
