 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>spec).match
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows any type of `spec` object, potentially causing a runtime error and bypassing the original check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
spec.toString().match
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string representation of `spec` matches the regex, which may not have the same result as checking the `spec` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[...spec].match
```
This would result in different behavior because it treats `spec` as an iterable and checks if its elements match the regex, which is not the intended behavior of checking if the `spec` string matches the regex.

DONE.
