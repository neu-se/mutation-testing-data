  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression would always evaluate to a truthy value, whereas the original `a` expression would evaluate to a falsy value if `a` is 0 or any other falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b - 1` expression would always evaluate to a truthy value, whereas the original `a` expression would evaluate to a falsy value if `b` is 0 or any other falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * b` expression would always evaluate to a truthy value, whereas the original `a` expression would evaluate to a falsy value if `a` or `b` is 0 or any other falsy value.

DONE.
