  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is a function that returns a property value, while `!prop` is a boolean value indicating whether `prop` is falsy or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is a function that returns a property value, while `prop.toUpperCase()` is a function that returns the uppercase version of the property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is a function that returns a property value, while `prop.split('')` is a function that returns an array of substrings split by the empty string.

DONE.
