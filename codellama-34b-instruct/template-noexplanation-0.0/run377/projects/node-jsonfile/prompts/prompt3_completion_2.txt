  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This change will cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to receive a string instead of a file object, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.name
```
This change will cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to receive the name of the file instead of the file object itself, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.read()
```
This change will cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to receive the result of the `read` method of the file object instead of the file object itself, which may cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
