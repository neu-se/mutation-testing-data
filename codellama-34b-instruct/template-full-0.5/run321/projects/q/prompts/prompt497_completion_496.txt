  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would be called with a `null` value for the `reason` parameter, which would not be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would be called with an `undefined` value for the `reason` parameter, which would not be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would be called with a new `Error` object for the `reason` parameter, which would be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

DONE.
