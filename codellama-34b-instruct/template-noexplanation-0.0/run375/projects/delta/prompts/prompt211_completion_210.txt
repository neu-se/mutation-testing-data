  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, this.ops.length - 1)
```
This code fragment will remove the last operation from the `ops` array, which is the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1, this.ops.length)
```
This code fragment will remove the first operation from the `ops` array, which is different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, this.ops.length - 2)
```
This code fragment will remove the last two operations from the `ops` array, which is different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
