  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create` creates a new object with the specified prototype, while `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value. If the code tries to access properties or methods on the resulting promise object, it will throw an error because `null` does not have any properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any defined value. If the code tries to access properties or methods on the resulting promise object, it will throw an error because `undefined` does not have any properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello, World!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting promise object would have a `toString` method that returns the string "Hello, World!". The code may not expect this and could break if it tries to use the promise object as an object instead of
