  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, and the rejection would not be tracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, and the rejection would not be tracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with the rejection reason, and the rejection would be tracked.

DONE.
