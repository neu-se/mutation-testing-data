  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.done
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is a promise, and `result.value.done` is a boolean indicating whether the promise is fulfilled or not. In the original code, the promise is passed to the `when` function, which waits for the promise to be fulfilled and then returns the fulfilled value. However, if we replace `result.value` with `result.value.done`, the `when` function would receive a boolean value instead of a promise, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is a promise, and `result.value.then` is a function that takes a callback function as an argument and returns a new promise that is fulfilled with the return value of the callback function. In the original code, the promise is passed to the `when` function, which waits for the promise to be fulfilled and then returns the
