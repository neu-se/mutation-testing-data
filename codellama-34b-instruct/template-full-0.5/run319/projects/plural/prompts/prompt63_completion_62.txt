  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is "bacterium" and the replacement code fragment is "bacteria", which is the correct plural form for "bacterium".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is "bacterium" and the replacement code fragment is "bacterium", which is the same as the original code fragment and would not result in any changes to the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is "bacterium" and the replacement code fragment is "bacteria", which is the correct plural form for "bacterium".

DONE.
