  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` returns a function that only invokes the provided function once, whereas the original code fragment uses the `values` function to convert a stream of arrays or streams into just a stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values(stream, 'object')
```
This would result in different behavior because `values` takes an optional second argument that specifies the type of the values in the stream, whereas the original code fragment does not specify a type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(values)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pipe` is a method that is used to pipe the output of one stream into the input of another, whereas the original code fragment uses the `values` function to convert a stream of arrays or streams into just a stream.

DONE.
