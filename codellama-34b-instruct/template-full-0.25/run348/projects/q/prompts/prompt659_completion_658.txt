  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong number of arguments to the `array_slice` function, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different number of arguments to the `array_slice` function, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different number of arguments to the `array_slice` function, which would cause an error.

DONE.
