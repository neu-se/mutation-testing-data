  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the unhandled rejections array, which would cause the tracking of unhandled rejections to be disabled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the length of the unhandled rejections array, which would cause the tracking of unhandled rejections to be disabled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable the tracking of unhandled rejections, which would cause the unhandled rejections array to not be updated.

DONE.
