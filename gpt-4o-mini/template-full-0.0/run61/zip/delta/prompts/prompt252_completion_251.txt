Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always attempts to retrieve zero operations, which would effectively return an empty operation regardless of the actual state of `thisIter`, potentially leading to incorrect diffs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `otherIter` instead of `thisIter`, which would lead to the wrong operations being processed and could result in an incorrect delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves one more operation than intended, which could cause an out-of-bounds error or incorrect processing of the operations, leading to unexpected results in the delta.

DONE.
