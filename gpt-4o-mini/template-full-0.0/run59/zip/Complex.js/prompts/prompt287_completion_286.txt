Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the cosine function instead of the sine function, leading to an entirely different output for the complex cosine calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the sine of `a + 1` instead of just `a`, introducing an offset that alters the expected result of the cosine calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part `b` instead of the real part `a`, which is incorrect for the cosine calculation and would yield an unexpected result.

DONE.
