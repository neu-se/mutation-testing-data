  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `spec` string on `/` characters, remove the first element of the resulting array, reverse the remaining elements, and then join them back together with no delimiter. This would result in a different string than the original `spec` string, which would cause the regular expression to match a different set of paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('') + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra `/` character to the end of the string, which would cause the regular expression to match a different set of paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('') + '/*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a wildcard character (`*`) to the end of the string,
