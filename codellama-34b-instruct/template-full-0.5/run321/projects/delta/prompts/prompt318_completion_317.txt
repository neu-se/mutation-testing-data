  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is a number, but the replaced code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `op.retain` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.attributes` is null, but the replaced code fragment checks if `op.attributes` is not null. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `op.attributes` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is a number
