  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retArr = retArr.map(function (el) {
	return {
		url: el.url,
		text: el.text,
		type: el.type
	}
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function is not being used correctly. The `map` function expects a function as its argument, but in this case, it is being passed a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retArr = retArr.map(function (el) {
	return {
		url: el.url,
		text: el.text,
		type: el.type
	}
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function is being used to create a new array with the same elements as the original array, but with a different structure. In this case, the new array would have objects with the same properties as the original elements, but with different values.

Option 3: The PL
