  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the accumulator, leading to incorrect results in the final callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the accumulator in the opposite way, leading to incorrect results in the final callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the sink function as the second argument to the final callback, which is not correct usage of the closure.

DONE.
