  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern has been modified to match any character that is not a vowel or y, rather than just vowels. This would cause the function to return the wrong plural form for words that end in a consonant followed by "o".

DONE.
