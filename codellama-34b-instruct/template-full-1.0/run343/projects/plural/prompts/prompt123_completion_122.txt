  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love)\b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the "money" and "research" words are no longer captured by the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research)\b/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the "g" flag at the end of the regular expression makes it match all occurrences in the input string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/
