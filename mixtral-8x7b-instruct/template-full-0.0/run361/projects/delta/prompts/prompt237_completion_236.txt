 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one less time than the original code fragment, potentially skipping some operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the length of the current operation in the `thisIter` iterator, instead of the length of the operation in the `otherIter` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max(opLength - 1, 0)
