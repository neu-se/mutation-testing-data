  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the deferred object as the `this` context to the `makeNodeResolver` function, while the modified code passes `null` as the `this` context. This could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the deferred object as the `this` context to the `makeNodeResolver` function, while the modified code passes `undefined` as the `this` context. This could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the deferred object as the `this` context to the
