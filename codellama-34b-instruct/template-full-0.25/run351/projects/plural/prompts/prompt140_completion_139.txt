  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1]` is a different value than `rule[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rules[i]` is a different value than `rule[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[i][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rules[i][0]` is a different value than `rule[0]`.

DONE.
