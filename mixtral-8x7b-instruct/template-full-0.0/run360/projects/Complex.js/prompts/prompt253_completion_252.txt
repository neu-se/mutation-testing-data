 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the `Math.atan2` function would always be 0, which would cause the resulting complex number to always have an angle of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the argument of the `Math.sin` function, which would change the resulting complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random number between 0 and 1, which would be used as the argument to the `Math.sin` function, resulting in a different complex number.

DONE.
