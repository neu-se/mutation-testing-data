Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject when an error occurs, effectively ignoring the error condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only reject the promise if the error is explicitly `null`, which means any other error value would lead to a resolution instead of a rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof error === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only reject the promise if the error is a string, allowing non-string errors to be ignored and leading to a resolution instead of a rejection.

DONE.
