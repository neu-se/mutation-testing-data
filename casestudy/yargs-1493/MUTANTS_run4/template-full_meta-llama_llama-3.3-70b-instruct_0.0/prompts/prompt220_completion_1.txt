Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sw + 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an extra character 'x' to the switch string, which could lead to incorrect command line options being displayed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sw.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the switch string to uppercase, which could lead to incorrect command line options being displayed if the options are case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.alias[sw] || sw
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the alias of the switch if it exists, instead of the original switch string, which could lead to different command line options being displayed if the aliases are not correctly handled.

DONE.
