  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]).then(function(value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise, and the returned value is modified to be one greater than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]).then(function(value) {
    return Q.reject(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise, and the returned value is wrapped in a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]).then(function(value) {
    return Q.resolve(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise, and the returned value is wrapped in a resolved promise
