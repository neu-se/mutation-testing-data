  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to increment to the next element, potentially skipping over certain operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.prev()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to decrement to the previous element, potentially revisiting operations that have already been processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move forward through the `other` delta's operations, potentially missing certain operations in the `this` delta.

DONE.
