  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the attributes of the last operation to the new operation, rather than merging them as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { ...lastOp.attributes }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the attributes object, rather than merging them as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new empty attributes object, rather than merging the attributes of the last operation as intended.

DONE.
