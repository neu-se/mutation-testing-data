  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the current timezone to the previous result, instead of replacing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev * tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the current timezone by the previous result, instead of replacing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev - tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the current timezone from the previous result, instead of replacing it.

DONE.
