  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would cause the resulting value to be greater than 1, which would cause the atan2 function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of sinθ instead of cosθ would cause the resulting value to be less than 1, which would cause the atan2 function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of tanθ instead of cosθ would cause the resulting value to be greater than 1, which would cause the atan2 function to return a different value.

DONE.
