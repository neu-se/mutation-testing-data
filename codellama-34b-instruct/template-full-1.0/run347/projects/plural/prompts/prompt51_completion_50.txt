  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends 'es' to the word, while this code fragment appends 's'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends 'es' to the word, while this code fragment appends 'ies'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends 'es' to the word, while this code fragment appends 'es' by removing the last character of the word and then appending 'es'.

DONE.
