  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` have different ranges and values, which would affect the calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` has a different range and values than `cos`, which would affect the calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse of `cos`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be reversed.

DONE.
