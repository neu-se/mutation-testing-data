  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `undefined`, rather than the resolved value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `null`, rather than the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always throw an error, rather than returning the resolved value of the promise.

DONE.
