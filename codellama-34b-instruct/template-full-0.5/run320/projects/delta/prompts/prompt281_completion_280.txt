  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and subtracting 1 would cause the `while` loop to terminate one iteration earlier.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and adding 1 would cause the `while` loop to iterate one more time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and multiplying by 2 would cause the `while` loop to iterate twice as many times.

DONE.
