  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` will return the index of the first occurrence of the specified value, while `lastIndexOf` will return the index of the last occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` will return a boolean indicating whether the specified value is present in the string, while `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` will return the index of the first or last occurrence of the specified value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` will return an array of matches, while `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` will return a single index.

DONE.
