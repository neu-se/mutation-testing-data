  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object for the given id, rather than the entire data object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id].current
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current timezone for the given id, rather than the entire data object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id].all
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all the timezones for the given id, rather than the entire data object.

DONE.
