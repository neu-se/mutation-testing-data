  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ2 = asin(sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation of φ2 to always be equal to φ1, regardless of the value of θ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ2 = acos(sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation of φ2 to always be complementary to φ1, regardless of the value of θ.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ2 = atan2(sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ, cosθ);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation of φ2 to be incorrect, since the argument to atan2() is not a pure longitude value.
