  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(-b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will negate the value of `b`, causing the final result of the expression to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` will be increased by 1, causing the final result of the expression to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` will be halved, causing the final result of the expression to be incorrect.

DONE.
