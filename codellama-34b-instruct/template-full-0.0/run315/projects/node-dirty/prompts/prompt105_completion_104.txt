  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is the value of the `row` object, while `row.key` is the key of the `row` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row["key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `row["key"]` is the value of the `key` property of the `row` object, while `row.key` is the key of the `row` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key + "foo"` is a string concatenation of the `row.key` and the string "foo", while `row.key` is a string.

DONE.
