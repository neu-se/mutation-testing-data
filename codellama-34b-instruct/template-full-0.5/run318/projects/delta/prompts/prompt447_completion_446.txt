  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the index of the array that is being accessed, potentially returning a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value being accessed, potentially changing the result of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value being accessed by 2, potentially changing the result of the expression.

DONE.
