  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` expects a function as its argument, but `undefined` is not a function. In the original code, `defer` is called with a function that returns a promise, but in this modified code, `defer` is called with `undefined`, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` expects a function as its argument, but `null` is not a function. In the original code, `defer` is called with a function that returns a promise, but in this modified code, `defer` is called with `null`, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the function passed to `defer` in the original code returns a promise, but the function passed
