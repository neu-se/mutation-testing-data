  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to check if the last occurrence of '\n' is not equal to -1 instead of checking if it's equal to -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\\n') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to check if the last occurrence of '\\n' is equal to -1 instead of checking if it's equal to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('&n') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to check if the last occurrence of '&n' is equal to -1 instead of checking if it's equal to -1.

DONE.
