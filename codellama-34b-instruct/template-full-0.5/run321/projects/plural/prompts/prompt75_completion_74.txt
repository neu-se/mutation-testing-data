  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'diez'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "die" to check for pluralization, while the new code fragment uses "diez" which is not a valid English word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "die" to check for pluralization, while the new code fragment uses "dice" which is a valid English word but has a different meaning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dyes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "die" to check for pluralization, while the new code fragment uses "dyes" which is a valid English word but has a different meaning.

DONE.
