  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the `cb || function () {}` expression would be evaluated first, and the result would be passed as the second argument to the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the `cb && function () {}` expression would be evaluated first, and the result would be passed as the second argument to the `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb ? function () {} : function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator has higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the `cb ? function () {} : function () {}` expression would be evaluated first, and the
