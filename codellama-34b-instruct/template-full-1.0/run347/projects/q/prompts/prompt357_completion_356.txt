  Sure, I can help you with that!

Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
reject("ERROR")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called with a hardcoded string, whereas the original code fragment calls `reject` with the `exception` variable. This could cause the promise to reject with a different error message than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement will cause an error to be raised, whereas the original code fragment calls `reject` to return a rejected promise. This could cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value is returned as the resolved value of the promise, whereas the original code fragment returns the `value` argument. This could cause the
