  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the property to `undefined` instead of deleting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the property to `null` instead of deleting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, false]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the property to `false` instead of deleting it.

DONE.
