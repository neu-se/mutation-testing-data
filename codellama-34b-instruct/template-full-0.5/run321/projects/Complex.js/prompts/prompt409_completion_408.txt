  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'], temp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the real and imaginary components of the complex number, which would cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] + 1, temp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary component of the complex number, which would cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] + 1, temp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the real component of the complex number, which would cause the function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
