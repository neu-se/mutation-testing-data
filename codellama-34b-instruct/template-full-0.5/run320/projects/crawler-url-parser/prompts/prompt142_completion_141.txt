  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/g, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which would make the regex match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because a space is added to the replacement string, which would cause the replaced text to be separated from the surrounding text by a space.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is empty, which would cause the matched text to be removed from the input string.

DONE.
