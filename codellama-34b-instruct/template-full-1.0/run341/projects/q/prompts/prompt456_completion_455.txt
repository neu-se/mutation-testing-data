  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
method_indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `method_indexOf` is not a valid method of the `array` object in JavaScript, while `array_indexOf` is. This would cause a `ReferenceError` at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.indexOf` is not a valid method of the `array` object in JavaScript, while `array_indexOf` is. This would cause a `ReferenceError` at runtime.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index_of
```
This would result in different behavior because `index_of` is not a valid method of the `array` object in JavaScript, while `array_indexOf` is. This would cause a `ReferenceError` at runtime.

DONE.
