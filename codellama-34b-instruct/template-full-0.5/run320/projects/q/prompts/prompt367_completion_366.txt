  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is the function that handles fulfilled promises, while `_rejected` is the function that handles rejected promises. Replacing `_rejected` with `_fulfilled` would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is the function that handles rejected promises, and passing `null` as the exception would cause the promise to be rejected with a different exception than the original code. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause the promise to be rejected with the original exception, which is not the same as the behavior of the original code. This
