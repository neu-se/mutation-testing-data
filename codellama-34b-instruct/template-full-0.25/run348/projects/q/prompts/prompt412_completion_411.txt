  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled, while this replacement checks if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled, while this replacement checks if the promise is rejected and the value is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled, while this replacement checks if the promise is rejected and the value is null.

DONE.
