  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `slice` method would be one less than the original code, which means the resulting slice would be one character shorter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length, baseIndex + length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `slice` method would be twice the length of the original code, which means the resulting slice would be twice the length of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length, baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `slice` method would be negative, which would cause the slice to start before the beginning of the string.

DONE.
