  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === null` would return `true` if `b` is `null`, but the original code fragment would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === undefined` would return `true` if `b` is `undefined`, but the original code fragment would return `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null && b !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `b !== null && b !== undefined` would return `false` if `b` is `null` or `undefined`, but the original code fragment would return `true` in those cases.

DONE.
