  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor(offset)` would always round the offset down to the nearest integer, while `min` would return the smallest value in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because `offset % 60` would return the remainder of `offset` divided by 60, while `min` would return the smallest value in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil(offset / 60)` would always round the offset up to the nearest integer, while `min` would return the smallest value in the array.

DONE.
