  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` value would be incremented by 1, which would change the resulting offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` value would be used instead of the `utcOffset` value, which would change the resulting offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` value would be decremented by 1, which would change the resulting offset string.

DONE.
