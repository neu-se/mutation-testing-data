  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the square root of `a`, which is not the same as the original code fragment `Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - a))`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the square root of `b`, which is not the same as the original code fragment `Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - a))`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the square root of `r`, which is not the same as the original code fragment `Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - a))`.

DONE.
