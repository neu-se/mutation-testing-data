  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.any
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` and `any` are two different methods in the `Promise` class, and they have different semantics. `all` returns a promise that is fulfilled when all of the promises in the array are fulfilled, while `any` returns a promise that is fulfilled when any one of the promises in the array is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `race` is a method that returns a promise that is fulfilled when any one of the promises in the array is fulfilled, and it returns the value of the first promise that is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the specified reason, and it does not wait for any of the promises in the array to be fulfilled.
