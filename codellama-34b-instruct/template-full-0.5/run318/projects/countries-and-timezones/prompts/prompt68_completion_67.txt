  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `id` property of the `country` object is falsy, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `id` property of the `country` object is undefined, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.hasOwnProperty('id')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `id` property is not an own property of the `country` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
