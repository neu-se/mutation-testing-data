Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object itself has the own property, rather than checking if it has the property with the current key, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the key to a string before checking if it's an own property, which could lead to differences in behavior if the keys are not already strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(obj)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first key of the object, rather than the current key in the iteration, potentially skipping some properties or processing them incorrectly.

DONE.
