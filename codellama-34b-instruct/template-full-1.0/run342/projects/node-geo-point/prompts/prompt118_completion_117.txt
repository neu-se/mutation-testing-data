  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```distance + 1```
This would result in different behavior because the function would calculate the distance between two points that are 1 meter apart, instead of the original distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```distance - 1```
This would result in different behavior because the function would calculate the distance between two points that are 1 meter apart, instead of the original distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```2 * distance```
This would result in different behavior because the function would calculate the distance between two points that are twice as far apart as the original distance between the two points.

DONE.
