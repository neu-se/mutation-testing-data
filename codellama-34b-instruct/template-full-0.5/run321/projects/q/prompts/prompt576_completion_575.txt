  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `continuer` function to be called with a `null` context, which would likely cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `continuer` function to be called with an `undefined` context, which would likely cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(self, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `continuer` function to be called with a `self` context, which would likely cause it to behave differently than the original code.

DONE.
