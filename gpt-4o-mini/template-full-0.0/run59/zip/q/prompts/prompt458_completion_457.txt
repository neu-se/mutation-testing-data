Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not find the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to the rejection not being untracked and potentially causing memory leaks or incorrect handling of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would also prevent the function from finding the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array, similar to using `null`, and would result in the same issues with untracked rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise + "extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "extra" to the promise object, causing the `array_indexOf` function to fail in finding the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to incorrect untracking behavior.

DONE.
