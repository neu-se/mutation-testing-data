  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been reversed, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected in a different way than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, "", progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument (the rejection callback) has been replaced with an empty string, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately without waiting for the rejection callback to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument (the rejection callback) has been replaced with null, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately without waiting for the rejection callback to be called.

DONE.
