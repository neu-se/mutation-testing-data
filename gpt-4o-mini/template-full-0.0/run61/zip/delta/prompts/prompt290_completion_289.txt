Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the iterator to consume one element regardless of the actual length of the current operation, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the remaining operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, which means the same operation could be processed multiple times, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively does nothing (consuming zero elements), which could cause the loop to continue indefinitely or skip necessary operations, resulting in incorrect processing of the delta.

DONE.
