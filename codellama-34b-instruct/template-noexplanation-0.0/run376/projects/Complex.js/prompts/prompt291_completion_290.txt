  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This change will cause the `tan` function to return the sine of the input instead of the tangent, which will result in a different output for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This change will cause the `tan` function to return the hyperbolic cosine of the input instead of the tangent, which will result in a different output for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This change will cause the `tan` function to return the arccosine of the input instead of the tangent, which will result in a different output for the same input.

DONE.
