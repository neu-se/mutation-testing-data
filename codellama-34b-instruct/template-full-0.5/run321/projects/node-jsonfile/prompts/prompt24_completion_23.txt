  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` returns a string representation of the object, whereas `JSON.parse` returns the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse` in the original code fragment, but it is being passed in this modified code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is being passed to `JSON.parse` in the original code fragment, but it is not being passed in this modified code fragment.

DONE.
