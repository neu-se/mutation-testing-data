  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` returns the tangent of a number, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the complement of the sine, rather than the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI - Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the difference between the cosine and pi, rather than the cosine.

DONE.
