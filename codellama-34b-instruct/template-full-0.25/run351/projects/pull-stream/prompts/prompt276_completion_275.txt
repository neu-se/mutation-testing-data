  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` would be called immediately, instead of being called conditionally based on the value of `_read`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextChunk()` would be called immediately, instead of being called conditionally based on the value of `_read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(null, function(end, stream) {
  if(end)
    return cb(end)
  if(stream && 'object' === typeof stream)
    stream = values(stream)
  else if ('function' !== typeof stream)
    stream = once(stream)
  _read = stream
  nextChunk()
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextStream()` function would be called with a different callback function, which would cause the `nextChunk()` function to be called
