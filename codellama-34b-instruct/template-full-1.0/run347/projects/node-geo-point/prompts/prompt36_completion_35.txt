  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` have different values at different points on the unit circle, and would produce a different calculation result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point1Rad * point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` have different values at different points on the unit circle, and would produce a different calculation result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(0, Math.min(1, <PLACEHOLDER>))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clamp the value of the placeholder to the range [0, 1], which would produce a different calculation result.

DONE.
