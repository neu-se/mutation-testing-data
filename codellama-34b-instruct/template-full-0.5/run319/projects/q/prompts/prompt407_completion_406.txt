  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if `value` is an instance of the `Promise` class, whereas the original code fragment checks if `value` is a promise by calling the `isPromise` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of `value` is not necessarily the same as the `Promise` constructor, even if `value` is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.isPromise(value) || value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `value` is a promise using both the `isPromise` function and the `instanceof` operator, which could result in different behavior if the `isPromise` function is not defined or if `value` is not an instance of the `Promise` class.

DONE.
