 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'goose'.concat('', 'geese')
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using the ternary operator to conditionally choose between 'goose' and 'geese', it concatenates an empty string to 'goose', which would always return 'goosegoose' instead of 'geese'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'x' }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of applying the correct pluralization rule for the given regular expression, it simply appends 'x' to the input word, which is not a valid pluralization rule for any of the words in the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() + 'S' }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of applying the correct pluralization rule, it converts the input word to uppercase and
