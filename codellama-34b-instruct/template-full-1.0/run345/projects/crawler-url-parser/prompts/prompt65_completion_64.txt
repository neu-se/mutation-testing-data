  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host = "example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl.host` property is being set to a hardcoded value, which would cause the `parse` function to always return the same value for any input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host = parsedUrl.host.substring(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method is being called with an incorrect index, which would cause the `parse` function to return an incorrect value for any input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl.host` property is being set to `undefined`, which would cause the `parse` function to throw
