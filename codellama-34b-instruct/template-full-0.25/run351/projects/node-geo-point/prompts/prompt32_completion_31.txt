  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude) - deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference in radians between the two longitudes, which would not produce the same result as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude) + deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of the two longitudes in radians, which would not produce the same result as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude) * deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of the two longitudes in radians, which would not produce the same result as the original code fragment.

DONE.
