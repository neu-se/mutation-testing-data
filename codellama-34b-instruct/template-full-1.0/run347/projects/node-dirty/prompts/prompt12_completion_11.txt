Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because `key++` increments the value of `key`, which would cause the statement `this._data.set(key, val)` to use a different key than the one that was originally intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `key + 1` would evaluate to a different value than `key`, which would cause the statement `this._data.set(key, val)` to use a different key than the one that was originally intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `key - 1` would evaluate to a different value than `key`, which would cause the statement `this._data.set(key, val)` to use a different key than the one that was originally intended.

DONE.
