  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is increased by 1, which would cause the output to have more spaces than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is decreased by 1, which would cause the output to have fewer spaces than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is multiplied by 2, which would cause the output to have twice as many spaces as expected.

DONE.
