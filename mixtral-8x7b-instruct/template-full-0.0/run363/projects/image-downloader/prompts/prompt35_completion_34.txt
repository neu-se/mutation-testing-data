 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.destroy;
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.destroy` is a function to destroy the incoming message. It immediately releases the resources associated with the message. Unlike `res.pipe`, it doesn't pipe the data to the destination stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createWriteStream;
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.createWriteStream` is a function to create a writable stream. It doesn't start piping the data from the response to the destination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' }));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags: 'a'` option will open the file in append mode, which means the data will be added to the end of the file, instead of overwriting the file.

DONE.
