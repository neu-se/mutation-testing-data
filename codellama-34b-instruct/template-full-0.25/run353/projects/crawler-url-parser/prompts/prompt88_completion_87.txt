  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only extract the first word of the link text, whereas the original code fragment extracts the entire link text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the link text to lowercase, whereas the original code fragment leaves the link text as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().replace(/[^\w\s]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all non-word and non-whitespace characters from the link text, whereas the original code fragment leaves the link text as is.

DONE.
