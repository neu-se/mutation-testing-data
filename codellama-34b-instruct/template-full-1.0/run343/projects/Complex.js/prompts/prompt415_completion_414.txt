  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` and `Math.sqrt()` have different functions. While `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number, `Math.floor()` rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, while `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` would return the product of `a` and `b`, while `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number.

DONE.
