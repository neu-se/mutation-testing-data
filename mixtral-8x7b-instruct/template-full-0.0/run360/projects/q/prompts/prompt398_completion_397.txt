 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method would return a promise that is immediately resolved with `null`, instead of resolving with the provided `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
