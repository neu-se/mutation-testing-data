  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of `ctx`, potentially causing the `matches` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of `ctx`, potentially causing the `matches` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return a different value than `ctx`, potentially causing the `matches` method to return a different result.

DONE.
