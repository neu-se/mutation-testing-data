 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof length === 'number' && length >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it now checks if the length is greater than or equal to 0 instead of less than or equal to 0, allowing positive numbers to pass the condition when they should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof length === 'string' && length.length <= 0
