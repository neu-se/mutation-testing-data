  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.skip()
```
This would result in different behavior because `skip()` will jump over the next operation, whereas `next()` would return the next operation and move the iterator to the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek(1)` will return the next operation without moving the iterator, whereas `next()` will move the iterator to the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` would check if there is a next operation without moving the iterator, whereas `next()` would move the iterator to the next operation and return it.

DONE.
