Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `null` as the second argument, potentially leading to unexpected results when composing attributes, as it ignores the actual attributes of `otherOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes, thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the attributes being composed, which could lead to a different outcome in the resulting attributes, depending on how the `compose` function is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, { unexpected: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an object with an unexpected property instead of the actual attributes of `otherOp`, which could cause the composition logic to behave incorrectly or throw an error.

DONE.
