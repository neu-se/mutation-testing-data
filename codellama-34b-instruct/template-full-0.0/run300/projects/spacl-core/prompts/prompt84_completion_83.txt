  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element. In this case, the `clone` method is called on each rule, which would result in a new array of cloned rules, rather than a new array of the original rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(0, this.rules.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array with the elements from the start index (inclusive) to the end index (exclusive), while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element. In this case, the new array would contain all the elements of the original array except for the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
