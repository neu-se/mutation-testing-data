  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the `attributes` object is changed from 0 to 1, which would cause the `newOp.attributes = attributes;` line to be executed even if `attributes` is undefined or has a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the `attributes` object is changed from 0 to 2, which would cause the `newOp.attributes = attributes;` line to be executed even if `attributes` is undefined or has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 3
