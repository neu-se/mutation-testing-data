  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\*
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the RegExp to match the literal string "/\*" instead of just "/".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/*/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the RegExp to match the literal string "/*" instead of just "/".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\**
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the RegExp to match the literal string "/*" instead of just "/".

DONE.
