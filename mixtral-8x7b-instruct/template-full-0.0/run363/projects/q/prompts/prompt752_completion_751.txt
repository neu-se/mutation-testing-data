 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error("Dummy rejection")
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object is created instead of using the original `rejection` variable, which might contain specific error information that could be used in error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is used instead of an error object, which would change the way error handling code would treat this situation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable is used instead of the error object, which might cause issues in error handling code that expects an error object.

These changes would introduce differences in behavior, which would not be caught by the current test suite, indicating potential weaknesses in the test coverage.

DONE.
