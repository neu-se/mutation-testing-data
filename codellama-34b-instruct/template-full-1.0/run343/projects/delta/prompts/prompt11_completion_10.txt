  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the properties of `b` instead of `a`, which may give different results depending on the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a, b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the properties of both `a` and `b`, which may give different results depending on the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a; b;) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a syntactically incorrect statement and would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
