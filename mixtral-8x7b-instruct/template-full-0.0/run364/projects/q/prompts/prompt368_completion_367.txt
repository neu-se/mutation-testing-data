 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be rejected with the `exception` object, bypassing the original logic that checks if the `rejected` callback is a function and calling it with the `exception` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be resolved with a value of `null`, bypassing the original logic that checks if the `rejected` callback is a function and calling it with the `exception` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be resolved with the `exception` object, instead of being rejected. This would bypass the original logic that checks if the `rejected` callback is a function and calling it with the `exception` object.
