  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment returns the word in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment returns the word without its first letter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, '') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment returns the word without its trailing 's'.

DONE.
