  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String(bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `String` function would convert the `bearing` value to a string, which would cause the `rad2deg` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bearing` value would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `rad2deg` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bearing` value would be increased by 10, which would cause the `rad2deg` function to return a different value.

DONE.
