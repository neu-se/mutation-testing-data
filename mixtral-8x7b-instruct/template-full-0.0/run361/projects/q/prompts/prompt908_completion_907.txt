 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, excluding the first argument (the `this` value), which is not the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of the enumerable property names of the arguments object, which is not the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.apply(Array.prototype.slice, arguments, [1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Reflect.apply` method to call the `Array.prototype.slice` method with the `arguments` object as the `this` value and an array with a single element `[1]` as the arguments, which is not the intended behavior in the original code.
