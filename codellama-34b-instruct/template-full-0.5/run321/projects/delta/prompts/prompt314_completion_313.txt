  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.insert` inserts the given text at the current position, whereas `inverted.delete` deletes the given number of characters from the current position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(op))
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(Op.length(op))` retains the given number of characters from the current position, whereas `inverted.delete` deletes the given number of characters from the current position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.push(op)` pushes the given operation onto the inverted delta, whereas `inverted.delete` deletes the given number of characters from the current position.

DONE.
