  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `allRejected` returns a promise that is rejected if any of the input promises are rejected, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of promises, regardless of whether any of the input promises are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of promises, regardless of whether any of the input promises are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of values, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of promises.

DONE.
