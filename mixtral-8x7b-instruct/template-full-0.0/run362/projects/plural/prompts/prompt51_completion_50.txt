 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'e' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a single 'e' instead of 'es', changing the pluralization of words ending in a consonant followed by 'o'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method instead of `substr`, potentially behaving differently for certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.replace(/.$/, 'es') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `replace` method with a regular expression, which may have different behavior compared to directly concatenating 'es' to the word.

DONE.
