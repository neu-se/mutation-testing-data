  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, while this replacement checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.length === src.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality between the two strings, while this replacement checks for equality between their lengths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.indexOf(src) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, while this replacement checks if the index of the `src` string in the `targetBasePath` string is equal to -1, which means it is not found.

DONE.
