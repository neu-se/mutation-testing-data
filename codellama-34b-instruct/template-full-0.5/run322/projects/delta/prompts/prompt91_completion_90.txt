  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is null.

DONE.
