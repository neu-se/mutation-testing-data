  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` argument is missing, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` argument is in the wrong position, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because there are too many arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method, which would cause an error.

DONE.
