  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk()` is a function that returns the opposite of `ses.ok()`, so it would return `true` if `ses.ok()` returns `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ses.ok
```
This would result in different behavior because `!ses.ok` is a boolean value that is the opposite of `ses.ok()`, so it would be `true` if `ses.ok()` returns `false`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.ok()` is a function that returns `true` if the current environment is a secure environment, and `false` otherwise. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `ses.ok()`, the code would always return `true` regardless of the
