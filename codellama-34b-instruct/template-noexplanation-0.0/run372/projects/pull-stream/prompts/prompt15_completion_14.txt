  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args === undefined
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `args` is `undefined`, which is not the same as `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args !== null
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `args` is not `null`, which is not the same as `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `args` is an empty array, which is not the same as `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
