  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `http://` protocol would be replaced with `https://`, which could cause issues with SSL certificates or other security-related issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `http://` protocol would be replaced with `ftp://`, which is a different protocol for transferring files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `http://` protocol would be replaced with `file://`, which is a protocol for accessing local files.

DONE.
