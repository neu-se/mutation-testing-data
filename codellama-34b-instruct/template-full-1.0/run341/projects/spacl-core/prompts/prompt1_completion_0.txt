  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `===` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used instead of `!==` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator is used instead of `===` operator.

DONE.
