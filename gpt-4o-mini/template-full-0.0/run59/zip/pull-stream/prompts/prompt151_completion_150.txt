Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the arguments passed to the callback function, which may lead to incorrect handling of the `abort` state and the `onAbort` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(value, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses `value` as the first argument to `abortCb`, which may not be the intended usage and could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument of the callback to `true`, which may indicate an error or failure, while the original code intended to call `abortCb` to handle the abort scenario properly.

DONE.
