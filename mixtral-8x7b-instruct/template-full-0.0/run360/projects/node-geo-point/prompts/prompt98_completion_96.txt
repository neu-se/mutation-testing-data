 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of x is always 1, instead of being calculated based on the input parameters. This would cause the calculated longitude value to be incorrect, leading to a different result from the original method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
