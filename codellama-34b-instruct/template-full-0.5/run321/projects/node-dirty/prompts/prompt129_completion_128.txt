  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `this._writeStream.cork(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which means that the `cork` method is called with a placeholder argument, which is intended to be replaced with a real argument later. However, if we replace the placeholder with `null`, the `cork` method will be called with a `null` argument, which may cause the method to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(this._writeStream.write);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `this._writeStream.cork(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which means that the `cork` method is called with a placeholder argument, which is intended to be replaced with a real argument later. However, if we replace the placeholder with `this._writeStream.write`, the `cork` method will be called with
