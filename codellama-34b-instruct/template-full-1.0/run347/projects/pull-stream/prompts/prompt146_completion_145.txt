  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property returns the number of properties in an object, while the original code fragment using `values` returns an array of the object's property values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns the values of an object's properties, while the original code fragment using `keys` returns the keys themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of `[key, value]` pairs, while the original code fragment using `keys` returns an array of keys.

DONE.
