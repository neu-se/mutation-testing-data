  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses `Math.floor` instead of `Math.ceil`. This could cause the resulting offset string to be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the modulo operator instead of `Math.floor`. This could cause the resulting offset string to be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 60
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses a different operator. This could cause the resulting offset string to be different from the original.

DONE.
