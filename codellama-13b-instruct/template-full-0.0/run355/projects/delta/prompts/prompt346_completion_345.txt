  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of `opData` is a string, while the original code fragment was accessing the `insert` property of `opData` as an object. This could cause the code to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `insert` property of `opData` is a number, while the original code fragment was accessing the `insert` property of `opData` as an object. This could cause the code to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData.insert.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `insert` property of `opData` is a number, while the original code fragment was accessing the `insert` property of `opData` as
