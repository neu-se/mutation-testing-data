  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!abort` will always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`, because the `!` operator is used to negate the value of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort !== true` will always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort !== null` will evaluate to `true` if `abort` is `true`, because `null` and `true` are not equal.

DONE.
