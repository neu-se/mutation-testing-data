  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches "default" instead of "index", which could cause the code to misclassify URLs that contain "default" instead of "index".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches "default" in a case-insensitive manner, which could cause the code to misclassify URLs that contain "default" in a different case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches "default" globally, which could cause the code to misclassify URLs that contain "default" multiple times.

DONE.
