  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise["catch"](function (err) { });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an empty error handling function, which would prevent the error from being propagated to the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise["finally"](function () { });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an empty finally handler, which would be executed after the promise is resolved or rejected, but it would not affect the result of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function (err) { });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an empty error handling function, which would prevent the error from being propagated to the promise chain.

DONE.
