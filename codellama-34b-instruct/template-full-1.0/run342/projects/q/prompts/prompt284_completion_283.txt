  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fails with a more specific error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => resolve());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fails faster without a promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code rejects with a more explicit reason.

DONE.
