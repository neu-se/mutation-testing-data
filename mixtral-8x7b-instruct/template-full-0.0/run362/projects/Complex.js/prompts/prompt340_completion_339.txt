 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0 && b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the abstract equality operator (`==`) instead of the strict equality operator (`===`). This could lead to unexpected behavior due to type coercion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + b * b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the sum of squares of `a` and `b` is equal to zero, which is only true for the complex number (0, 0). However, the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the reciprocal of the sum of squares of `a` and `b`. This would cause a division by zero error if `a` and `b` are both
