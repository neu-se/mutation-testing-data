  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine of a number, whereas `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `sqrt` returns the square root of a number, whereas `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `abs` returns the absolute value of a number, whereas `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine.

DONE.
