  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let verb
```
This would result in different behavior because `let` declares a block-scoped variable, while `const` declares a constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var verb
```
This would result in different behavior because `var` declares a function-scoped variable, while `const` declares a constant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb = 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the value `'foo'` to the variable `verb`, while the original code does not assign any value.

DONE.
