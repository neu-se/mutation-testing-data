Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from replacing specific patterns in the path to splitting the path into an array of segments, which would affect how the path is processed in subsequent logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the entire path to uppercase, which would disrupt any comparisons or pattern matching that rely on the original casing of the URL path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it mistakenly uses `linkurl_path` instead of `pageurl_path`, potentially leading to incorrect path processing and comparisons based on the wrong URL context.

DONE.
