  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bound()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is called immediately, whereas the original code fragment `bound` is a reference to the `bound` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is called with the `bound` function as an argument, whereas the original code fragment `bound` is a reference to the `bound` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bound.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is called on the `bound` function with `this` as the context, whereas the original code fragment `bound` is a reference to the `bound` function.

DONE.
