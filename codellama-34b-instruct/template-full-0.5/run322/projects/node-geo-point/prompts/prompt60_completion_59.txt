  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a dependency on the latitude of the starting point, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a dependency on the longitude of the starting point, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a dependency on the latitude and longitude of the starting and ending points, which are not present in the original code.

DONE.
