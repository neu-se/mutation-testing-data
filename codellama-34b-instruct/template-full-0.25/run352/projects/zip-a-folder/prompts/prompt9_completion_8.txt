  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function checks if the input is a glob pattern, and if it is, it returns `true`. In the original code, the `!` operator is used to negate the result of `isGlob(src)`, so if `src` is a glob pattern, the result would be `false`. However, if we replace the PLACEHOLDER with `isGlob(src)`, the result would be `true`, which would cause the code to enter the `if` block even if `src` is not a glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the input string contains the specified substring. In the original code, the `!` operator is used to negate the result of `isGlob(src)`, so if `src` is a glob pattern, the result would be `false`. However, if we replace
