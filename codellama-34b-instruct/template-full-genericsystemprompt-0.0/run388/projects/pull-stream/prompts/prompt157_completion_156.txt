  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value
```
This would result in different behavior because `_value` is a different variable than `value`, and it may not be null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` is a different variable than `_value`, and it may not be null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `_value` or `value`, and it may not be null.

DONE.
