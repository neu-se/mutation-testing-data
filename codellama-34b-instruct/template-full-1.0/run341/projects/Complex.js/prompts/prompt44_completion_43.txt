  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because this code checks for inequality, whereas the original code checks for undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because this code checks if the product of `a` and `b` is not equal to zero, whereas the original code checks for undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because this code checks if `b` is undefined, whereas the original code checks for not-undefined.

DONE.
