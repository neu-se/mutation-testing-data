  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(b)` returns the hyperbolic cosine of `b`, while the modified code fragment `cosh(b) + 1` returns the hyperbolic cosine of `b` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(b)` returns the hyperbolic cosine of `b`, while the modified code fragment `sinh(b)` returns the hyperbolic sine of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(b)` returns the hyperbolic cosine of `b`, while the modified code fragment `cos(b)` returns the cosine of `b`.

DONE.
