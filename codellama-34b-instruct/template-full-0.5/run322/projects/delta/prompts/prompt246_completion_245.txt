  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.retain` would retain the deleted text instead of deleting it, which would change the outcome of the diff.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.push` would add the deleted text to the delta instead of deleting it, which would change the outcome of the diff.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.concat` would concatenate the deleted text to the end of the delta instead of deleting it, which would change the outcome of the diff.

DONE.
