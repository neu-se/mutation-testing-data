 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would always execute its block of code, even when unhandledRejection tracking is disabled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would only execute its block of code if `trackUnhandledRejections` is explicitly set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!global.trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would only execute its block of code if `trackUnhandledRejections` is not set in the global scope.

DONE.
