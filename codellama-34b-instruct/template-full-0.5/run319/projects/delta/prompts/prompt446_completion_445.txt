  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the op, which could cause the iterator to skip over the last op in the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the op, which could cause the iterator to loop back to the beginning of the list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the length of the op by 2, which could cause the iterator to skip over half of the ops in the list.

DONE.
