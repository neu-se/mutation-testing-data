  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, _value
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would receive `undefined` as the second argument instead of `null`, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, _value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to the callback function would be `null + 1`, which would result in a different value than `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'', _value
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would receive an empty string as the second argument instead of `null`, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
