  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it passes `null` as the first argument to `abortCb`, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(undefined, abort, onAbort)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it passes `undefined` as the first argument to `abortCb`, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(abort, abort, onAbort)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it passes `abort` as the first argument to `abortCb`, which may cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
