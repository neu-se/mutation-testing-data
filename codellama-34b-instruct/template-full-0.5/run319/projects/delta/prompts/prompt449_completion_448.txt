  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for strict equality between `op.delete` and the string `'number'`, rather than checking if `op.delete` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for strict inequality between `op.delete` and the string `'number'`, rather than checking if `op.delete` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `op.delete` is a string, rather than checking if it is a number.

DONE.
