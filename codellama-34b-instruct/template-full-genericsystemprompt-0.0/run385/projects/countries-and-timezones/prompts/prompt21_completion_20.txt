  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tz.d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `tz.d` is not an integer, regardless of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `tz.d` is equal to 0, regardless of its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `tz.d` is not equal to 0, regardless of its value.

DONE.
