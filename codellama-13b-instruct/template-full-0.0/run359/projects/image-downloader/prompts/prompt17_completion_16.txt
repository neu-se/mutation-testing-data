  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would be called on the `decodedBasename` variable, which would cause the filename to be uppercased.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.basename()` method would be called on the `options.dest` variable, which would cause the filename to be extracted from the destination path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(options.dest, 'new-filename')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.join()` method would be called on the `options.dest` variable with a new filename, which would cause the filename to be changed.

DONE.
