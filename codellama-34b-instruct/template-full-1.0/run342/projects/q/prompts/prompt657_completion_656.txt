  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the length of the `arguments` object instead of the arguments passed to the `Q.invoke` method, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var args = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `args` variable with an empty array, which could cause the `Q.invoke` method to fail if it relies on the original contents of the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the `args` variable altogether, which could cause the `Q.invoke` method to fail if it relies on the `args` variable's presence.

DONE.
