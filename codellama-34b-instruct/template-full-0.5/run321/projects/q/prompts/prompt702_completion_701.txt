  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_splice` is a different function than `array_slice`, and it would change the way the arguments are passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a different value than `array_slice`, and it would change the way the arguments are passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `array_slice`, and it would change the way the arguments are passed to the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
