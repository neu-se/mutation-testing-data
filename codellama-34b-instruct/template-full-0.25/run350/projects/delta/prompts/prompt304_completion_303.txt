  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would not be called at all, as the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would be called with a negative index, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would be called with an infinite index, which would cause an error.

DONE.
