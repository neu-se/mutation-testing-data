 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.cos()` function on the `distance` variable instead of calculating the angular distance in radians. This change would cause incorrect distance calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / distance
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the reciprocal of the `distance` variable instead of dividing the radius by the `distance`. This change would cause incorrect distance calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(-distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the exponential function of the negative `distance` variable instead of dividing the radius by the `distance`. This change would cause incorrect distance calculations.

DONE.
