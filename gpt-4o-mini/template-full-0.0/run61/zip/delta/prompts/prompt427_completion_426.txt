Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is a string instead of a number, which would cause the function to return `undefined` for cases where `op.retain` is actually a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is `null`, which would incorrectly bypass the logic for handling numeric retain values, leading to unexpected results when `op.retain` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is an object, which would incorrectly allow the function to return `1` for any object, including arrays or other non-numeric types, instead of correctly handling numeric retain values.

DONE.
