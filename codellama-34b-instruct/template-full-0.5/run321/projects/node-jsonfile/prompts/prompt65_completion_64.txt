  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` will replace all occurrences of the search string, whereas `replace` will only replace the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/\n/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\n/g` will match all newlines in the content, whereas the original code only matches the first newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^/g` will match the beginning of the content, whereas the original code only matches the first character.

DONE.
