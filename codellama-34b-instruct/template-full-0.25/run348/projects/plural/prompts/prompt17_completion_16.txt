  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original, and the function passed as the second argument is also different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original, and the function passed as the second argument is also different.

DONE.
