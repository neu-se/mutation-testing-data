  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the unary negation operator to negate the value of `x`, while the replaced code fragment uses the subtraction operator to subtract `x` from zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the unary negation operator to negate the value of `x`, while the replaced code fragment uses the identity function to return the value of `x` unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the unary negation operator to negate the value of `x`, while the replaced code fragment uses the multiplication operator to multiply the value of `x` by 2.

DONE.
