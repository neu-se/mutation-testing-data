  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if both are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if `this` is not a number or `z` is infinite.

DONE.
