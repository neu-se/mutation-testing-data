  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` takes a single argument and returns its square root, whereas `Math.pow` takes two arguments and returns the first argument raised to the power of the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` takes a single argument and returns its natural logarithm, whereas `Math.pow` takes two arguments and returns the first argument raised to the power of the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` takes a single argument and returns its sine, whereas `Math.pow` takes two arguments and returns the first argument raised to the power of the second argument.

DONE.
