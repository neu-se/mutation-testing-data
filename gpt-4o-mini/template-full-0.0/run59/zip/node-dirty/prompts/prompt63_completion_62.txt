Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `end` method on the read stream instead of the write stream, which would lead to an error since `readStream` does not have an `end` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly call the `write` method without any arguments, which would not properly close the write stream and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately destroy the write stream without properly ending it, potentially leading to data loss or corruption as any pending writes would not be completed.

DONE.
