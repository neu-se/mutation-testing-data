 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts the newOp at the beginning of the ops array instead of the correct position based on the logic before the PLACEHOLDER.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops = [newOp, ...this.ops];
