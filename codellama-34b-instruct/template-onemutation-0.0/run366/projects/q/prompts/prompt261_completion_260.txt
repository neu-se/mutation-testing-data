  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `resolvedPromise` is `false`. This would allow the `become` function to be called even if the promise has already been resolved, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
