 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` is a method that terminates the stream and emits the `'close'` event, whereas the original code fragment used `destroy(error)` which destroys the stream and emits the `'error'` event with the provided error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroySoon(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroySoon()` is a method that allows the stream to finish any pending writes before terminating the stream and emitting the `'destroy'` event, whereas the original code fragment used `destroy(error)` which destroys the stream immediately and emits the `'error'` event with the provided error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.emit('error', error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit()` is a method that emits a specified event, whereas the original code fragment
