  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript and cannot be used as a method name. Using `catch` instead of `then` would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method that resolves a promise with the given value. Using `resolve` instead of `then` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that rejects a promise with the given reason. Using `reject` instead of `then` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.

DONE.
