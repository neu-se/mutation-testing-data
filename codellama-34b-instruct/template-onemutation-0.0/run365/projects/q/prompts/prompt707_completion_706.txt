  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `arguments` object from the first element, while the new code fragment slices it from the second element. This would cause the `fbound` function to receive one fewer argument than expected, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
