  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_shift` removes the first element of the array, while `array_slice` creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.pop()` removes the last element of the array, while `array_slice` creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.splice(1)` removes the second element and all following elements of the array, while `array_slice` creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
