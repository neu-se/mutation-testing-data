  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `self.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.fulfill` is not a valid method on the `self` object, whereas `self.resolve` and `self.reject` are.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.settle
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.settle` is not a valid method on the `self` object, whereas `self.resolve` and `self.reject` are.

DONE.
