  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick.runAfter` method would not be able to run the task, as it would be set to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick.runAfter` method would not be able to run the task, as it would be set to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick.runAfter` method would not be able to run the task, as it would be set to `0`.

DONE.
