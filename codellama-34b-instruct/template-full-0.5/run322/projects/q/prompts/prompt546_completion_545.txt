  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument would be incremented by 1, which could change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument would be decremented by 1, which could change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument would be multiplied by 2, which could change the result of the function.

DONE.
