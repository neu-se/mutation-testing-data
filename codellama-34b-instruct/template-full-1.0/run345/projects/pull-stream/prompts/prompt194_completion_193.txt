  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb`, which called the callback function passed to `read` with the argument `abort`, while the new code fragment would call the callback function with the argument `abort` instead of the expected `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb`, which called the callback function passed to `read` with the argument `abort`, while the new code fragment would call the callback function with the argument `null` instead of the expected `err`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb`, which called the callback function passed to `read` with the argument `abort`, while the new code fragment would call the callback function with the argument `undefined` instead of the expected `err`.

DONE.
