  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase(), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method will convert the path to uppercase, which may not be intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + "foo", ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the path will be concatenated with the string "foo", which may not be intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split("").reverse().join(""), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the path will be reversed, which may not be intended behavior.

DONE.
