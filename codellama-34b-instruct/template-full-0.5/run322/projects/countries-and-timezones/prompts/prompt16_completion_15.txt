  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(id);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `id` to the `all` array instead of the `current` array, which could lead to unexpected results in the `buildCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.push(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `a` variable to the `current` array instead of the `id` variable, which could lead to unexpected results in the `buildCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.push(tz.r);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `tz.r` value to the `current` array instead of the `id` value, which could lead to unexpected results in the `buildCountry` function.

DONE.
