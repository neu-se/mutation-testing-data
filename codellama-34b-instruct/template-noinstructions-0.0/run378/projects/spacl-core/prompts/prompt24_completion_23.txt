  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(max > 0) && any`, which would always be false if `max` is 0, regardless of the value of `any`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 || !any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(max > 0) || (!any)`, which would always be true if `max` is 0 and `any` is true, regardless of the value of `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && !any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(max > 0
