  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the minimum of the two lengths, rather than the length of the current operation in the `thisIter` iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the sum of the two lengths, rather than the length of the current operation in the `thisIter` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the maximum of the two lengths, rather than the length of the current operation in the `thisIter` iterator.

DONE.
