  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver()));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called with the return value of `nodeArgs.push`, which is the new length of the `nodeArgs` array, instead of the original code where `nodeArgs.push` is called separately from `deferred.resolve`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver()));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called with the return value of `nodeArgs.push`, which is the new length of the `nodeArgs` array, instead of the original code where `nodeArgs.push` is called separately from `deferred.reject`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver()) + 1;
```
This would result in different
