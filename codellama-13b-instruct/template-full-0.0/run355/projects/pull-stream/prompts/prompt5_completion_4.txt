  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function is applied to the `throughs` array, which would double the values in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.filter(function(x) { return x > 5; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` function is applied to the `throughs` array, which would remove any values less than 5 from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.reduce(function(x, y) { return x + y; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` function is applied to the `throughs` array, which would sum the values in the array.

DONE.
