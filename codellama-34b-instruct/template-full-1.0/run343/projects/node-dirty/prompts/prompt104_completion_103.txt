  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` removes the key-value pair from the `Map` object, whereas `set` updates the value associated with the key. This means that the `forEach` loop in the `load` method would not iterate over the entire dataset if `delete` is used instead of `set`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) = row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value of the `key` property to `row.val`, whereas `set` updates the value associated with the `key` by updating the corresponding value in the `Map` object. This means that the `forEach` loop in the `load` method would not iterate over the entire dataset if `get(key) = row.val` is used instead of `set`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data[key] = row.val
```
