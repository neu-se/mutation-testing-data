  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `object === null` would only check if the `object` is null, but not if it's an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof object !== 'object'` would check if the `object` is not an object, but it would not check if it's null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `object == null` would check if the `object` is null or undefined, but it would not check if it's an object.

DONE.
