  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with the verb "throw" instead of "next", which would cause the generator to throw an error instead of continuing to the next iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with the verb "return" instead of "next", which would cause the generator to return a value instead of continuing to the next iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with the verb "yield" instead of "next", which would cause the generator to yield a value instead of continuing to the next iteration.

DONE.
