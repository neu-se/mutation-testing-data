 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty object as the `options` parameter, even if the original code passed a customized object. This change could affect the behavior of functions that rely on specific properties of the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty object as the `options` parameter if the original `options` variable is falsy (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, or `0`). This change could affect the behavior of functions that rely on specific properties of the `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options && options.someProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes the `someProperty` property of the `options` object, if it exists. If the `options` object does not have the `someProperty` property or is `null`, `undefined`, or
