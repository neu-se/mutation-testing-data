  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to pass the data to the callback, but replacing it with null would cause the callback to be called with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to pass the data to the callback, but replacing it with undefined would cause the callback to be called with an undefined argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to pass the data to the callback, but replacing it with a string would cause the callback to be called with a string argument instead of the expected data.

DONE.
