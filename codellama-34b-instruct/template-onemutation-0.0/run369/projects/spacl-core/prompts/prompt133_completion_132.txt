  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.keys()` returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, while `this.verbs` returns the object itself. This change would cause the `for...in` loop to iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the object itself, which could potentially cause the loop to skip over certain keys or cause errors if the keys are not valid identifiers.
