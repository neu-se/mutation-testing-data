  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.pop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method is used to remove and return the last element of the array, while the originally intended code was using the `pop` method to remove and return the last element of the buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method is used to remove and return the last element of the array, while the originally intended code was using the `pop` method to remove and return the last element of the buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.slice(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is used to return a shallow copy of a portion of the array, while the originally intended code was using the `pop` method to remove and return the last element of the buffer.

DONE.
