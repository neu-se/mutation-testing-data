  The code gives a JavaScript client for working with timezones and countries. The PLACEHOLDER
indicates where duplicable coding may be present. Following are three
variants of code mutation testing:

Option 1: The placeholder can be changed to:
```
let tz =  buildTimezone(data, name);
return timezones[tz.name] ? { ...timezones[tz.name] } : null;
```

This results in different behavior since the original code uses the name passed into the function to build the timezone, while the derived code uses the timezone object generated by buildTimezone to obtain the name. The outcome of these actions might be different if an error has occurred in the buildTimezone function.

Option 2: The replaceable can be replaced with:
```
return timezones[name] ? { ...timezones[name] } : null;
```
This results in different behavior because the original code uses the name passed into the function to build the timezone, while the revised code uses the timezone object generated by buildTimezone to construct the time zone name. The result of
