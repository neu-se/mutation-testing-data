  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `void 0`, and it would change the behavior of the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of the arguments passed to the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a copy of the `args` array instead of the original array.

DONE.
