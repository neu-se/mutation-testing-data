  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i--` operator would decrement the value of `i` by 1, whereas the original code fragment `cb(null, i++)` would increment the value of `i` by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max` variable is not the same as the `i` variable, and the `cb` function would be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i + 1` expression would evaluate to a different value than `i++`, and the `cb` function would be called with a different argument.

DONE.
