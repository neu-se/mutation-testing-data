  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the second component of the diff result instead of the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the third component of the diff result instead of the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare a non-existing fourth component of the diff result.

DONE.
