  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new variable instead of reusing the existing `verb` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new variable with a different name, and the code that uses `verbs` would not work as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verbs = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new variable with a different value, and the code that uses `verbs` would not work as expected.

DONE.
