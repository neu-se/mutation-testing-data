Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the callback function would mean that no callback is executed after the data is persisted, potentially leading to unhandled cases where the caller expects a confirmation of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the callback with an empty function means that while the callback is still invoked, it does nothing, which could lead to confusion if the caller expects some action or confirmation to occur after the data is set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('Callback error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the callback with a function that throws an error would cause the application to crash or handle the error in an unexpected way, disrupting the normal flow of execution and potentially leading to unhandled exceptions.

DONE.
