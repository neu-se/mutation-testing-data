Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + '1', options
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `countryId` by appending a '1', which may lead to looking up a non-existent country, resulting in `null` being returned instead of the actual country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `options` parameter to an empty object, which may affect the behavior of the `getCountry` function and how it processes the country data, potentially ignoring any relevant options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId, { deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `options` to indicate that deprecated data should be included, which could lead to returning different timezones or country data than intended if the country has deprecated entries.

DONE.
