  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + 'file.txt'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `dest` is a string, and the new code fragment `dest + 'file.txt'` is a string concatenation, which would result in a different file name being passed to `createWriteStream`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `dest` is a string, and the new code fragment `dest.toUpperCase()` is a string conversion, which would result in a different file name being passed to `createWriteStream`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `dest` is a string, and the new code fragment `Math.random()` is a random number, which would result in a different file name being passed to `createWriteStream`.

DONE.
