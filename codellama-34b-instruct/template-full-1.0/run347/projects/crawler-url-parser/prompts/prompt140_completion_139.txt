  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]{3,}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match the default page if it is at least 3 characters long, whereas the original code fragment would match any default page regardless of its length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+\/[a-z]+\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any default page that is followed by a forward slash, regardless of the page name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+\/[a-z]+[0-9]+\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any default page that is followed by a forward slash and contains a number, regardless of the page name.

DONE.
