  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections != true
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical NOT operator (`!`) would be replaced with a comparison for inequality, resulting in a different logical outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical OR operator (`||`) would be replaced with a comparison for truthiness, resulting in a different logical outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical AND operator (`&&`) would be replaced with a comparison for truthiness, resulting in a different logical outcome.

DONE.
