  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.map(getTimezone)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getTimezone` takes an additional argument `options`, which is not passed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(getTimezone)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array containing only the elements for which the function returned true, whereas `map` returns a new array containing the return value of the function for each element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce((a, b) => a + b, getTimezone)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a single value that is the result of combining the elements of the array using the function, whereas `map` returns an array of the return value of the function for each element.

DONE.
