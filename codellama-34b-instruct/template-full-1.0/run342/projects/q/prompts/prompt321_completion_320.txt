  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race` is a function that returns a promise for the first of an array of promises to become settled, whereas `promise` was the name of a variable that was declared earlier in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that returns a promise for an array of promises to be settled, whereas `promise` was a singular promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q("hello").join(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a string, and the `join` method is not defined for strings, whereas `promise` was a promise.

DONE.
