  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is a different event listener that would be triggered when the output stream is closed, whereas `output.on` is an event listener that would be triggered when the output stream is opened.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.emit` would emit an event on the output stream, whereas `output.on` is an event listener that would be triggered when an event is emitted on the output stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.once
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.once` would trigger the event listener only once, whereas `output.on` would trigger the event listener every time the event is emitted on the output stream.

DONE.
