 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the final `eachLine` predicate call would receive an incremented index value, which could cause the predicate to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the final `eachLine` predicate call would receive a fixed value of 0, which could cause the predicate to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'placeholder'
```
This would result in different behavior because the final `eachLine` predicate call would receive a string instead of a number, which could cause the predicate to behave differently or throw an error.

DONE.
