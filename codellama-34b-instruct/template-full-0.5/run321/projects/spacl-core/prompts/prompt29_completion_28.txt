  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `reduce` to concatenate the parts of the path, while this replacement uses `reverse` to reverse the order of the parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `reduce` to concatenate the parts of the path, while this replacement uses `join` to concatenate the parts with an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((a, b) => b + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `reduce` to concatenate the parts of the path in the forward direction, while this replacement uses `reduce` to concatenate the parts in the reverse direction.

DONE.
