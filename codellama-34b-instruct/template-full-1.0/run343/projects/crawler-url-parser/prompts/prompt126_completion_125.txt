  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (url, baseUrl) {
	return parse(url, baseUrl);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `parse` function, while the new code fragment is a function expression that returns the result of calling the `parse` function with the same arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (url, baseUrl) {
	return url;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call that returns the result of parsing the `url` and `baseUrl` arguments, while the new code fragment is a function expression that simply returns the `url` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (url, baseUrl) {
	return null;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call that returns the result of parsing the `url` and `baseUrl` arguments, while the new code
