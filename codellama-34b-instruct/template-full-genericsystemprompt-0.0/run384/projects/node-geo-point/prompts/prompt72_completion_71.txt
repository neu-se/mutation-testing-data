  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Number` to convert the `distance` argument to a number, while `Math.floor` would round the number down to the nearest integer. This could cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `distance` as is, while `distance * 2` would double the distance. This could cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `distance` as is, while `distance + 1` would add 1 to the distance. This could cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than expected.

DONE.
