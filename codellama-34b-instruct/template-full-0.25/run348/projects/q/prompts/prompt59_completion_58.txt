  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is defined, while this replacement checks if it is undefined. This would cause the code to take the opposite branch of the conditional, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is defined, while this replacement checks if it is not an object. This would cause the code to take the opposite branch of the conditional, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is defined, while this replacement checks if it is not a string. This would cause the code to take the opposite branch of the conditional, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
