  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to be decremented by the length of the operation, which could cause the iterator to skip over certain operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to be incremented by the length of the operation plus one, which could cause the iterator to skip over certain operations or access out-of-bounds memory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to be incremented by the length of the operation minus one, which could cause the iterator to skip over certain operations or access out-of-bounds memory.

DONE.
