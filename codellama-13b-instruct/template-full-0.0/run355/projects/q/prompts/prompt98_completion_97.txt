  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one iteration less than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run two iterations more than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = index + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run 10 iterations more than the original code.

DONE.
