 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/, 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always appends 'x' instead of using a function to determine the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
