  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` would return `true` for `NaN`, while `a['abs']` would be `NaN`, which is not finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] = Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` would return `false` for `Infinity`, while `a['abs']` would be `Infinity`, which is not finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] = -Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` would return `false` for `-Infinity`, while `a['abs']` would be `-Infinity`, which is not finite.

DONE.
