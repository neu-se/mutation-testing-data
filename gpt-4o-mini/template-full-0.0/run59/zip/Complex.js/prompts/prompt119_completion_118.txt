Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because dividing by zero is undefined, which would lead to a runtime error or unexpected behavior, whereas the original code correctly calculates the sign based on the absolute value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly calculate the sign of the complex number by using the sum of the real and imaginary parts instead of the magnitude, which is not the intended mathematical operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'](1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a constant value (1) to the `abs` function instead of the actual complex number's magnitude, leading to incorrect results when calculating the normalized complex number.

DONE.
