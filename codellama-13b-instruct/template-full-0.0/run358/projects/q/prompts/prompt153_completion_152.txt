  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the default separator for the `join` method, which is a comma, whereas the new code fragment uses a newline character. This would cause the stack traces to be concatenated with newlines instead of commas, which could make them more readable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the default separator for the `join` method, which is a comma, whereas the new code fragment uses a space character. This would cause the stack traces to be concatenated with spaces instead of commas, which could make them more readable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the default separator for the `join` method, which is a comma, whereas the new code fragment uses an empty string as the separator.
