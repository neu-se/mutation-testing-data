  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is a function, while the new code fragment does not. If `cb` is not a function, the original code fragment would call `function () {}`, while the new code fragment would call `abort`.
