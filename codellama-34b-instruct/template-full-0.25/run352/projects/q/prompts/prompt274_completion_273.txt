  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `error != null` is always true, even if `error` is undefined or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `error !== null` is always true, even if `error` is undefined or null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `error !== undefined` is always true, even if `error` is undefined or null.

DONE.
