 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise might have a null value, while the original code does not affect the returned promise's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve.call(deferred, promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method would be called with the `promises` argument instead of passing the resolved value directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(function () { deferred.resolve(promises) })()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method would be called within an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE), which could affect the closure and variable access within the function.

DONE.
