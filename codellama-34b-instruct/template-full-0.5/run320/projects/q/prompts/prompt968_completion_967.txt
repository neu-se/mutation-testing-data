  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression is replaced with `null`, which is a valid object and would cause the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method to be called with a different context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression is replaced with `undefined`, which is a primitive value and would cause the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method to be called with a different context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression is replaced with `this`, which refers to the current object and would cause the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method to be called with a different context.

DONE.
