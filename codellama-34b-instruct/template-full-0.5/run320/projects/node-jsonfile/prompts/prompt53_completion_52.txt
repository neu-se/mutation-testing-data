  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replacer` function would not be called, leading to a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = function(key, value) { return value }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replacer` function would be called with a different implementation, leading to a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = function(key, value) { return value * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replacer` function would be called with a different implementation that multiplies the value by 2, leading to a different output.

DONE.
