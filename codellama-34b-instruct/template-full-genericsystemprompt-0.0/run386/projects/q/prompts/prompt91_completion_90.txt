  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` reverses the order of the elements in the array, while `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array, while `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array that is the result of merging the original array with the given arguments, while `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

DONE.
