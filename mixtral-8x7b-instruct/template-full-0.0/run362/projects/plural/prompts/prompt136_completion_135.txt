 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'String'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string 'String' instead of the actual type of the input object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire function object instead of just the name of the type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'string'
