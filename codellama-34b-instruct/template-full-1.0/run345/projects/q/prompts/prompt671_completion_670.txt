  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `this` value to the function, rather than `undefined` as in the original code. This could potentially change the behavior of the function, especially if it relies on the `this` value being `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `call` method to apply the `args` array to the function, rather than the `apply` method. This could potentially change the behavior of the function if it relies on the specific behavior of `apply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to the `args` array, rather than applying the `args` array to the function directly. This could potentially change
