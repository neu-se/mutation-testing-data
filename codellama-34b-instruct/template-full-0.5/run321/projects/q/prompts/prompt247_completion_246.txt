  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the stack trace, rather than a reference to the original stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of the stack trace, starting from the second character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the stack trace in reverse order.

DONE.
