  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not a function call, but a reference to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not a function call, but a reference to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not a function call, but a reference to a function.

DONE.
