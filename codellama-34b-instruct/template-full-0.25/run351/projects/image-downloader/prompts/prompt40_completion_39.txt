  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest + '1' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property would be set to a different value, which could cause the file to be saved with a different name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property would be set to a different value, which could cause the file to be saved with a different encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, mode: 'w' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` property would be set to a different value, which could cause the file to be saved with different permissions.

DONE.
