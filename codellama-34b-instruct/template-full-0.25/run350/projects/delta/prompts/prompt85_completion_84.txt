  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the `attributes` property of `newOp` to a non-null value, while this modified code sets it to null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the `attributes` property of `newOp` to a non-empty object, while this modified code sets it to an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { foo: 'bar' };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the `attributes` property of `newOp` to an object with a specific property, while this modified code sets it to an object with a different property.

DONE.
