 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty object does not have the `op` property, which is expected in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` does not have the `op` property, causing an error when the code tries to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ op: 'random' }
