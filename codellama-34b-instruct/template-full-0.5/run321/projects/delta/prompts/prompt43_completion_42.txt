  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the length was less than or equal to 0, but replacing it with 1 would cause it to always evaluate to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the length was less than or equal to 0, but replacing it with -1 would cause it to always evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the length was less than or equal to 0, but replacing it with NaN would cause it to always evaluate to false.

DONE.
