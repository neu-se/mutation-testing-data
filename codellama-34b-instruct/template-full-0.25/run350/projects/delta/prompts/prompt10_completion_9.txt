  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of `a[key]` is not equal to the value of `b[key]`, rather than checking if `a[key]` is not equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both `a[key]` and `b[key]` are not equal to `undefined`, rather than checking if `a[key]` is not equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key] && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a[key]` is not equal to `b[key]` and `b[key]` is not equal to `undefined`, rather than checking if `a[key]` is not equal
