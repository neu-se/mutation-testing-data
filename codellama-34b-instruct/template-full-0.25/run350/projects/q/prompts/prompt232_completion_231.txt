  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the second operand instead of the first, which could cause the promise to resolve or reject with an unexpected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first operand instead of the second, which could cause the promise to resolve or reject with an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the fourth operand instead of the second, which could cause the promise to resolve or reject with an unexpected value.

DONE.
