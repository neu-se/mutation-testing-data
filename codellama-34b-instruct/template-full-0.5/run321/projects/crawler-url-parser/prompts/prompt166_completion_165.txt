  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only considered the case where the part count difference was exactly -1, while the new code fragment would consider any difference greater than -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only considered the case where the part count difference was exactly -1, while the new code fragment would consider any difference that is not exactly -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only considered the case where the part count difference was exactly -1, while the new code fragment would consider any difference less than -1.

DONE.
