  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because "yield" is not a valid verb for a generator, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because "throw" is not a valid verb for a generator, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "return"
```
This would result in different behavior because "return" is not a valid verb for a generator, and would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
