  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called immediately, rather than being passed as a reference to the `setTimeout` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a `null` argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a function that does nothing, which would cause the promise to be resolved immediately.

DONE.
