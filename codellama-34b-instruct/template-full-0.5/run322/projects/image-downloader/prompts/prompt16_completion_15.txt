  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `split()` returns an array of strings, and `pop()` returns the last element of that array, which may not be the intended destination path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/[^\/]+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace()` returns a new string with the replacement made, while the original code fragment returns the modified `options.dest` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.substring(0, options.dest.lastIndexOf('/'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring()` returns a new string with the specified range of characters, while the original code fragment returns the modified `options.dest` object.

DONE.
