  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.message` is a string representing the reason for the rejection, whereas `reason.stack` is a string representing the stack trace at the time the rejection was thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.name` is a string representing the name of the error constructor that was used to create the rejection reason, whereas `reason.stack` is a string representing the stack trace at the time the rejection was thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.code
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.code` is a number representing the error code that was used to create the rejection reason, whereas `reason.stack` is a string representing the stack trace at the time the rejection was thrown.

DONE.
