  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a constant value, while `y` is a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing pi, while `y` is a variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is a variable, while `y` is another variable.

DONE.
