  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` as the divisor, while the replacement code fragment uses `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` as the divisor, while the replacement code fragment uses `a + b` as the divisor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` as the divisor, while the replacement code fragment uses `a - b` as the divisor.

DONE.
