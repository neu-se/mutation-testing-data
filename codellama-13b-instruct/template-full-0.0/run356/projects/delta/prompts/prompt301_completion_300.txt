  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator increments the value of `i` by 1, whereas the original code fragment simply assigns the value of `i` to `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+=` operator increments the value of `i` by 1, whereas the original code fragment simply assigns the value of `i` to `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator concatenates the value of `i` with the string "1", whereas the original code fragment simply assigns the value of `i` to `i`.

DONE.
