  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `op.attributes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `op.attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `op.attributes`.

DONE.
