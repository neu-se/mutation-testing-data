  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual('a', 'b')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for equality using the `isEqual` function, which checks for deep equality, while the new code fragment is using the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual('a', 'b') && !same_type
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for equality using the `isEqual` function, which checks for deep equality, while the new code fragment is using the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality. Additionally, the new code fragment is also checking if the types of the compared values are the same, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual('a', 'b')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for equality using the `isEqual` function, which checks for
