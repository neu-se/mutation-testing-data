  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would be called on `undefined`, causing a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would be called with an offset of `2` instead of `1`, potentially changing the resulting stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 3);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would be called with an offset of `3` instead of `1`, potentially changing the resulting stack trace.

DONE.
