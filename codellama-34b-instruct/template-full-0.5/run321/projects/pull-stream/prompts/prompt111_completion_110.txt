  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function would be called with `null` as the second argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function would be called with `undefined` as the second argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function would be called with `NaN` as the second argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
