  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `ended` variable, causing the code to enter the `if` block when `ended` is `false`, and not enter the `if` block when `ended` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the code to enter the `if` block only when `ended` is `true` and `test(data)` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the code to enter the `if` block only when `ended` is `false` or `test(data)` is `true`.

DONE.
