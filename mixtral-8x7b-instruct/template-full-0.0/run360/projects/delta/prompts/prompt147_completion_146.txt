 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next.bind(null)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `thisIter.next()` without a context, which may cause an error or unexpected results if `thisIter` is not properly initialized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek()` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next()` returns and advances the iterator. This may cause an infinite loop or incorrect results in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.splice` is not a function, and attempting to call it would cause a TypeError. This may happen if the `thisIter` object is not properly initialized or if the code is executed in a different context.

DONE.
