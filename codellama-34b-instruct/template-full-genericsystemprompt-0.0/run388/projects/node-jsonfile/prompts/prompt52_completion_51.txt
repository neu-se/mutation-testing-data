  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` expects an object as its first argument, but `obj.toString()` returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` expects an object as its first argument, but `obj[0]` returns the first element of the object, which may not be an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` expects an object as its first argument, but `obj.length` returns the length of the object, which may not be an object.

DONE.
