  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed, which would cause the regular expression to match only at the end of the string, regardless of the case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which would cause the regular expression to match only at the end of the string, regardless of the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the string, regardless of the case.

DONE.
