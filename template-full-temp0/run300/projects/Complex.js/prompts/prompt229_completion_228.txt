  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `r + a`, which would result in a different value for the argument of the `Math.sqrt` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `r + a`, which would result in a different value for the argument of the `Math.sqrt` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `r + a`, which would result in a different value for the argument of the `Math.sqrt` function.

DONE.
