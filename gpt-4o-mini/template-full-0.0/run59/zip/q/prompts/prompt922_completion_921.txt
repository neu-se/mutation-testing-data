Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, causing the promise to succeed regardless of the error that occurred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Custom error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a new custom error message instead of the original exception, potentially altering how the error is handled downstream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a `null` value instead of the original exception, which may lead to confusion or improper handling of the rejection in the promise chain.

DONE.
