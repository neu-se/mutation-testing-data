  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because when `places` is a falsey value (such as `0`), the code would return `0` instead of `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because when `places` is less than or equal to `0`, the code would not divide the result by `places`, which would change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because when `places` is greater than or equal to `0`, the code would divide the result by `places`, which would change the result.

DONE.
