  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the variable used in the previous line of code, and it may have a different value than `_a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is the variable used in the previous line of code, and it may have a different value than `_a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_b` is the variable used in the previous line of code, and it may have a different value than `_a`.

DONE.
