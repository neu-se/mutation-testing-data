Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic from retrieving the length of the current operation to retrieving its type, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations based on their type rather than their length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the next operation from the `otherIter` and adds 1, which could cause the code to process one extra character than intended, potentially leading to incorrect composition of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it reduces the length by 1, which could cause the code to skip processing the last character of the current operation, leading to incomplete or incorrect results in the composed delta.

DONE.
