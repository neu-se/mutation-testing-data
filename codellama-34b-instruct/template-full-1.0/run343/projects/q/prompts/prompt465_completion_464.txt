  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop() === promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method would remove the last element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would cause the index to shift and potentially return a different value from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(promise, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice()` method would remove the element at the index `promise` from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would result in different behavior if the index `promise` is not the same as the index where `promise` is located in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise !== unhandledRejections[array_indexOf(promise)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf(promise)` method would search for the
