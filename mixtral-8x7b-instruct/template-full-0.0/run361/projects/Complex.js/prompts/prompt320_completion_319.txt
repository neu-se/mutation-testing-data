 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original expression (2 * b) is used to calculate the conjugate of a complex number, while the modified expression (b * b) would result in the square of the imaginary part, which is not the conjugate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would always be 0, regardless of the value of b, which would affect the calculation of the square root in the 'asin' and 'acos' methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would use the property 'im' of the current object instead of the local variable 'b', which would affect the calculation of the conjugate in the 'csc' method.

DONE.
