Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the current element of the array instead of the next one, causing the function to return the same value repeatedly instead of progressing through the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback with a false value instead of true, which may lead to incorrect handling of the success state in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the next element in the array before the current one is returned, potentially leading to an "undefined" value being passed to the callback when the last element is reached.

DONE.
