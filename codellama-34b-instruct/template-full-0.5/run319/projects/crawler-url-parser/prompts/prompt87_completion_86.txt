  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because `text()` would return the text content of the element, while `text(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return the text content of the element with the placeholder string appended to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace()` would remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the text content of the element, while `text(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().split(' ').join('');
```
This would result in different behavior because `split()` and `join()` would remove any spaces from the text content of the element, while `text(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would not.

DONE.
