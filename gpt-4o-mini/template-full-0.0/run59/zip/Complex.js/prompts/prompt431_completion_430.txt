Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the imaginary part instead of the real part, leading to an incorrect ceiling calculation for the real component of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from multiplication to division, which would yield a significantly different result, potentially leading to incorrect ceiling values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(this['re'] * places)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the floor function instead of the ceil function, which would round down instead of up, leading to incorrect results for the ceiling operation.

DONE.
