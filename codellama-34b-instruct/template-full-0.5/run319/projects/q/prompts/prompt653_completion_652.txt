  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong number of arguments to the `post` method, which could cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong number of arguments to the `post` method, which could cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument to the `post` method, which could cause an error.

DONE.
