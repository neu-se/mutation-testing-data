  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos(sinφ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos()` returns the arccosine of a number, which is the angle in radians whose cosine is that number. In this case, `sinφ2` is the sine of the latitude, so `Math.acos(sinφ2)` would return the latitude in radians, which is not what we want.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin(sinφ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin()` returns the arcsine of a number, which is the angle in radians whose sine is that number. In this case, `sinφ2` is the sine of the latitude, so `Math.asin(sinφ2)` would return the latitude in radians, which is not what we want.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(sinφ2
