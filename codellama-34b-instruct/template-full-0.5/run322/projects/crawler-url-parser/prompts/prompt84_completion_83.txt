  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the trimmed text of the element, while the modified code fragment would return the trimmed text with spaces removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the trimmed text of the element, while the modified code fragment would return the trimmed text in lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the trimmed text of the element, while the modified code fragment would return the trimmed text with all non-word and non-whitespace characters removed.

DONE.
