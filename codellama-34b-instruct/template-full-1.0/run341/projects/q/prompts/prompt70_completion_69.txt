  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for equality with `0`, but the mutated code fragment is checking for equality with `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for equality with `0`, but the mutated code fragment is checking for equality with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for equality with `0`, but the mutated code fragment is checking for equality with an empty object.

DONE.
