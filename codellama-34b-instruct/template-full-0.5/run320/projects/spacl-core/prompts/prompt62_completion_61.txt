  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the `props` array, while `props.reverse` simply returns a reference to the `reverse` method of the `props` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.length` returns the length of the `props` array, while `props.reverse` returns a reference to the `reverse` method of the `props` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the `props` array, while `props.reverse` simply returns a reference to the `reverse` method of the `props` array.

DONE.
