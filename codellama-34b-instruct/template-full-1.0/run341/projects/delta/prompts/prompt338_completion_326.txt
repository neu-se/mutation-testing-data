  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the slice one index later than the original code, potentially missing the last operation in the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the slice one index earlier than the original code, potentially including an extra operation in the slice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the slice at twice the index of the original code, potentially including twice as many operations in the slice.

DONE.
