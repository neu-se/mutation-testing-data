  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `start` variable to be one character ahead of the original code, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `start` variable to be one character behind the original code, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be initialized to a different value, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

DONE.
