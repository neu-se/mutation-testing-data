Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the `callback` function would cause a runtime error when trying to invoke `null.apply`, leading to the promise not being resolved and potentially crashing the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of the `callback` function would also lead to a runtime error when attempting to call `undefined.apply`, preventing the promise from being resolved and causing unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return "error"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the `callback` with a function that returns a string "error" would change the expected resolution value of the promise, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the promise's resolved value in the calling code.

DONE.
