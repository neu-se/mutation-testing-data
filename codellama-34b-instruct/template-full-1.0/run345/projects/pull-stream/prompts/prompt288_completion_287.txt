  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` will cause the `try` block to throw an error, while the original code would have `data` be `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` will cause the `try` block to throw a `TypeError`, while the original code would have `data` be `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `!end` will be `true` if `end` is `false`, while the original code would have `data` be `null` in that case.

DONE.
