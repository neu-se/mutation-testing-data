  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `op` function to be called only if `end` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment would call `op` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `op` function to be called only if `end` is falsy, whereas the original code fragment would call `op` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end || op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would cause the `op` function to be called only if `end` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment would call `op` regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
