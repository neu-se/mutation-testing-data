  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty(Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a new property on the `Complex` object, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isFinite = function() {
  return isFinite(this['re']) && isFinite(this['im']);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new method to the `Complex` prototype, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['EPSILON'] = 1e-16;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `EPSILON` constant, which may affect the behavior of certain methods.

DONE.
