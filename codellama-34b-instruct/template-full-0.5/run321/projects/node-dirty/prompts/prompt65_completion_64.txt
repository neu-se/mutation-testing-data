  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would close the stream immediately, whereas `destroy()` would allow any remaining data to be flushed before closing the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` would close the stream with an error, whereas `end()` would close the stream without an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.write('corrupted data')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` would write corrupted data to the stream, whereas `end()` and `destroy()` would not write any data.

DONE.
