  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `void 0` is added to the end of the array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because a `null` value is added to the end of the array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because an `undefined` value is added to the end of the array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

DONE.
