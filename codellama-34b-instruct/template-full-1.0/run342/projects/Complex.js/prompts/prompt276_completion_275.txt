  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value `a` is increased by 1, which would cause the entire expression to have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value `a` is decreased by 1, which would cause the entire expression to have a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the value `a` is doubled, which would cause the entire expression to have a different value.

DONE.
