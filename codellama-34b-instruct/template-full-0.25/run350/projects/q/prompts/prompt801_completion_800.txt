  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a function, and it would cause the `progressed` callback to be called with `null` as its argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a function, and it would cause the `progressed` callback to be called with `undefined` as its argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be called instead of the `progressed` callback, and it would not provide any progress information to the callback.

DONE.
