  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, which would be handled by the unhandled rejection tracking code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the string "test", which would be handled by the unhandled rejection tracking code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("test")); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error object, which would be handled by the unhandled rejection tracking code.

DONE.
