  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called if the promise is fulfilled, leading to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called twice if the promise is rejected, leading to a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, function (reason) { throw reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would throw an error if the promise is rejected, leading to a different outcome.

DONE.
