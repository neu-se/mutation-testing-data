  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method takes no arguments, so the `<PLACEHOLDER>` would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last element from the `ops` array, regardless of whether it is a `retain` operation or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length - 1 - this.ops[this.ops.length - 1].retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `ops` array only if it is a `retain` operation, and the number of elements to remove would be determined by the `retain` property of the last element.
