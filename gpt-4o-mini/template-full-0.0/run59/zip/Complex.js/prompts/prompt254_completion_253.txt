Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it computes the natural logarithm of `a` instead of the exponential function, which would lead to incorrect results in the complex exponential calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(this['re'] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the real part before applying the exponential function, effectively scaling the result incorrectly and leading to a different output than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the imaginary part instead of the real part for the exponential calculation, which would yield an incorrect result for the complex number's exponential representation.

DONE.
