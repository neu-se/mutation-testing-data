  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size()` method is not defined on the `this._queue` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.length` would return the number of elements in the queue, whereas `this._queue.size()` would return the number of elements in the queue that have not been processed yet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra element to the queue, causing the loop to run one extra iteration.

DONE.
