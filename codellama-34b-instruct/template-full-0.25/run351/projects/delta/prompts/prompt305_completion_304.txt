  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the line is greater than 0, which means it is not empty. However, if we replace it with < 0, it will check if the length of the line is less than 0, which is always false, so the code inside the if statement will never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the line is greater than 0, which means it is not empty. However, if we replace it with == 0, it will check if the length of the line is equal to 0, which means it is empty. So, the code inside the if statement will be executed only if the line is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() != 0
```
This would result in different behavior
