  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.name` is not a function, and therefore `isStopIteration` would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, and `isStopIteration` would always return `false` when comparing a string to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
QReturnValue(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `QReturnValue` is a function that returns an object, and `isStopIteration` would always return `true` when comparing an object to a function.

DONE.
