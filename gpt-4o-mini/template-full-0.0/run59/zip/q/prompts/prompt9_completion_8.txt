Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "object" && define.amd
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `define` is an object instead of a function, which would lead to the AMD module definition not being recognized even if it exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && !define.amd
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the absence of the `amd` property, which would cause the code to skip the AMD module definition even if it is present, potentially breaking the module loading.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.commonjs
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a non-existent `commonjs` property instead of `amd`, which would lead to the code not recognizing the AMD module format and failing to define the module correctly.

DONE.
