  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of the two values, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the distance from the end of the string to the specified index, rather than the distance from the start of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.length - index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the distance from the end of the other string to the specified index, rather than the distance from the start of the other string.

DONE.
