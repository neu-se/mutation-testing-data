  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.reverse()` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array, while the original code fragment `props.reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array and returns a new array with the reversed elements.

DONE.
