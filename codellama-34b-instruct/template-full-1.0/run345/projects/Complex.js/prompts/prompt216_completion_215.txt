  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function calculates the sine of a number, whereas `Math.exp` calculates the exponential function. Using `Math.sin` would return incorrect results if the intention was to calculate the exponential function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<random number>)
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number would be used in place of the original code fragment, which would result in unexpected and incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex.exp` function calculates the complex exponential function, whereas `Math.exp` calculates the exponential function for real numbers. Using `Complex.exp` would return incorrect results if the intention was to calculate the real exponential function.

DONE.
