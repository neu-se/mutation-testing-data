  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the truthiness of `nodeback`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `nodeback` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, including the type of the operands. If `nodeback` is a function, it would not be equal to `null`, and the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, including the type of the operands. If `nodeback` is a function, it would not be unequal to `null`, and the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
