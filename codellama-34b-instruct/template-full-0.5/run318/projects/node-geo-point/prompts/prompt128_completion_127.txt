  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the latitude and longitude values, causing the `calculateDistance` method to return an incorrect distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude, this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the latitude and longitude values, causing the `calculateDistance` method to return an incorrect distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + point.longitude, this.latitude + point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the longitude and latitude values of both points, causing the `calculateDistance` method to return an incorrect distance.

DONE.
