  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function is called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the `if (end)` block to be executed, even if `end` is `false`. This would cause the `asyncMap` function to return `null` instead of the mapped data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function is called with `end` as the first argument, which would cause the `if (end)` block to be executed, even if `end` is `false`. This would cause the `asyncMap` function to return `end` instead of the mapped data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function is called with `err` as the first argument, which would cause the `if (err)`
