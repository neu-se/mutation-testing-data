  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return the first operation in the other delta, regardless of its type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to never return the first operation in the other delta, regardless of its type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return the first operation in the other delta, regardless of its type.

DONE.
