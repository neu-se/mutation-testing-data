Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to return `false` immediately if any rule returns `true`, which contradicts the original logic that only returns `false` if a rule explicitly denies the action.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `false` if any rule returns `null`, which means the action is not governed by the policy, rather than allowing the method to continue checking other rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat an undefined result as a reason to return `false`, which is not the intended logic since undefined does not indicate an explicit denial of the action.

DONE.
