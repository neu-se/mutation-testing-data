  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
位1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the starting point instead of the destination point, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
位2 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the longitude of the destination point, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
位2 - 位1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the longitude of the starting point from the longitude of the destination point, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
