  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `read` variable, while this new code fragment returns the value of `read` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `read` variable, while this new code fragment returns the value of `read` minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `read` variable, while this new code fragment returns the value of `read` multiplied by 2.

DONE.
