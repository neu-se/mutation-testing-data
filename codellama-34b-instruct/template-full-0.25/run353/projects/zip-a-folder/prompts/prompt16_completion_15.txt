  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    throw new Error(`Permission error: ${err.message}`);
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `await` keyword to wait for the `access` method to complete, while this new code uses a callback function to handle the result. This could cause the program to behave differently if the `access` method returns an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK).then(() => {
  throw new Error('Permission error');
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `await` keyword to wait for the `access` method to complete, while this new code uses the `then` method to handle the result.
