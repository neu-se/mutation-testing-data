  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `decodeURIComponent` function to decode the basename, which may result in a different string than the `toLowerCase` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path.basename` method to get the basename of the URL, which may result in a different string than the `split` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.replace(/[^\w\d]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `decodeURIComponent` function to decode the basename, which may result in a different string than the `replace` method.

DONE.
