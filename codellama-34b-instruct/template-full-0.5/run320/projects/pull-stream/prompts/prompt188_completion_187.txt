  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the array in the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the array in reverse order.

DONE.
