  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the `type` property is not equal to `'Point'`, but this new code also checks if the `coordinates` array has less than 2 elements. If the `coordinates` array has less than 2 elements, the `fromGeoJSON` method would throw a `TypeError` even if the `type` property is equal to `'Point'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the `type` property is not equal to `'Point'`, but this new code also checks if the `coordinates` array has more than 2 elements. If the `coordinates` array has more than 2 elements, the `fromGeoJSON` method would throw a `TypeError` even if the `type` property
