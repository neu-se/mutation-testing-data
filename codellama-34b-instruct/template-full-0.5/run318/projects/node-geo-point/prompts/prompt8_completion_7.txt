  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty !== 'coordinates'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property, whereas the `!==` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the code would always return `false` because `point.hasOwnProperty` is a function and `'coordinates'` is a string, so they will never be strictly equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `coordinates` array is used to check if it has less than 2 elements, whereas the original code uses the `hasOwnProperty` method to check if the `coordinates` property is defined on the `point` object. In this case, the code would always return `true` because the `length` property is always defined, even if the array is empty.

Option 3: The PL
