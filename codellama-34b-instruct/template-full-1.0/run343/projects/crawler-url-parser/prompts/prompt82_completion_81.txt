  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).property("href")
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the property method to retrieve the href attribute instead of the attr method.  
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr({href: "test"})
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the href attribute to "test" instead of getting the href attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`let href = $(this).closest("a").attr("href");`
This would result in different behavior because it gets the href attribute from the closest <a> element instead of the current <a> element.

DONE.
