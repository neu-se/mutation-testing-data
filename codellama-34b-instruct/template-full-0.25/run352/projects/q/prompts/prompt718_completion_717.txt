  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is expecting an array of promises, but it would receive an array of numbers instead. This would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["a", "b", "c"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is expecting an array of promises, but it would receive an array of strings instead. This would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, null, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is expecting an array of promises, but it would receive an array of null values instead. This would cause the method to throw an error.

DONE.
