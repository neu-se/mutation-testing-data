Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the new operation to the end of the `ops` array instead of inserting it at the beginning, potentially altering the order of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `splice` to insert the new operation at the start of the array, but it is less efficient than `unshift` and may lead to unexpected results if the array is manipulated elsewhere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first operation from the `ops` array instead of adding the new operation, which would lead to loss of data and incorrect operation sequencing.

DONE.
