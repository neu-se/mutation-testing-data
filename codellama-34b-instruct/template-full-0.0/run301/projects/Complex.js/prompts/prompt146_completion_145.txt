  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `z` was an instance of `Complex`, but the new code fragment is checking if `z` is a function that returns a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `z` was an instance of `Complex`, but the new code fragment is checking if `z` is a function that returns a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `z` was an instance of `Complex`, but the new code fragment is checking if `z` is a function that returns a boolean value.

DONE.
