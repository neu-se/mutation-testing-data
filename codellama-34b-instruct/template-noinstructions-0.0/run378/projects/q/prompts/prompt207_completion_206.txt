  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn("deprecated")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always log a warning message to the console, regardless of whether the `console` object is defined or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console !== "undefined" &&
            typeof console.warn === "function" &&
            console.warn("deprecated")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only log a warning message to the console if the `console` object is defined and has a `warn` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console !== "undefined" &&
            typeof console.warn === "function" &&
            console.warn("deprecated")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only log a warning message to the console if the `console` object is defined and has a `warn` method, and it would do so asynchronously using `Q.nextTick`.

DONE.
