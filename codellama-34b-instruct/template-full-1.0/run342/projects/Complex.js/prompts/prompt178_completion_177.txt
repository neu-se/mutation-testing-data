  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` would evaluate to `0` instead of the expected value, causing the function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is an undefined variable, causing a runtime error instead of the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because `5` is a constant value, and would be used as the absolute value of the input, which is not the intended result of the function.

DONE.
