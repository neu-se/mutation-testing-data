  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant value is different. Instead of adding 1, it would add 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant value is now a string. The code would attempt to add the string 'a' to the result, which would result in a concatenation rather than a numerical addition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + 'z'
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant value is now a variable. The code would attempt to add the value of the variable 'z' to the result, which could result in a different outcome depending on the value of 'z'.

DONE.
