  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `a`, which is the real part of the complex number, while this replacement uses the variable `b`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `a`, which is the real part of the complex number, while this replacement adds 1 to the variable `a`, which changes the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `a`, which is the real part of the complex number, while this replacement multiplies the variables `a` and `b`, which changes the result of the calculation.

DONE.
