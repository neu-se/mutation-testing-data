  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return Complex['INFINITY'] when the divisor is zero, instead of Complex['ZERO'].

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return Complex['NAN'] when the divisor is zero, instead of Complex['ZERO'].

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']() || a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return Complex['ZERO'] when the divisor is zero and the dividend is zero, instead of Complex['ZERO'] when the divisor is zero.

DONE.
