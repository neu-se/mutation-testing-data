  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-null value to be pushed to the `ops` array, but with `null`, the `push` method would not be called, and the `ops` array would remain unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a defined value to be pushed to the `ops` array, but with `undefined`, the `push` method would not be called, and the `ops` array would remain unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-empty object to be pushed to the `ops` array, but with `{}`, an empty object would be pushed, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

DONE.
