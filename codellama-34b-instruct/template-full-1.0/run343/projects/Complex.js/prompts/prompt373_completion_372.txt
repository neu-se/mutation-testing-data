  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the trigonometric function used in the calculation of the complex csch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the trigonometric function used in the calculation of the complex sech.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math. cubeRoot
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the function used to calculate the complex sech and tanh.

DONE.
