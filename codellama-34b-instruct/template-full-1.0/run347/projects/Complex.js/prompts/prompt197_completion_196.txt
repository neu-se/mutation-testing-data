  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would return the imaginary part of the complex number, while the original code would return the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z * z
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would return the square of the complex number, while the original code would return the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would return the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while the original code would return the imaginary part.

DONE.
