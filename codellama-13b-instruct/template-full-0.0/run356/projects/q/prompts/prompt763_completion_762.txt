  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `promises` variable, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `Q` variable. This would cause the code to behave differently, as the `Q` variable is not defined in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, promises
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `promises` variable, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `promises` variable again. This would cause the code to behave the same as the original code, as the `promises` variable is defined in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q, Q
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `promises` variable, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `Q` variable. This would cause the
