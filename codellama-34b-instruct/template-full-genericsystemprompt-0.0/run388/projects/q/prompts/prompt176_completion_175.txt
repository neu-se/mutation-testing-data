  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator between stack trace lines to a tab character instead of a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator between stack trace lines to a space character instead of a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<br>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator between stack trace lines to an HTML line break element instead of a newline character.

DONE.
