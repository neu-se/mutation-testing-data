 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).catch(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method would swallow any rejections, preventing them from being propagated or handled by the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).finally(() => {})
