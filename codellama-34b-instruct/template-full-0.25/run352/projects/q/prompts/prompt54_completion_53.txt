  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toString` is a function that returns a string representation of the `process` object, while `process.toString` is a string that represents the `process` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toString().length` is a number that represents the length of the string representation of the `process` object, while `process.toString` is a string that represents the `process` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString().charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toString().charAt(0)` is a string that represents the first character of the string representation of the `process` object, while `process.toString` is a string that represents the `process` object.

DONE.
