 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp(spec).exec(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because `exec` is used instead of `match`, which may return different results. Additionally, the first argument passed to `RegExp` should be a string, but it is using a variable `spec` that contains the path specification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/.test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it is testing the `spec` variable instead of the `spec` property of the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.spec.match
```
This would result in different behavior because it is using the `match` property of the `spec` string, rather than calling the `match` method on the string.

DONE.
