  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `encoding` property of the `options` object, which may or may not be present, while the original code fragment always used the `options` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"utf8"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the string "utf8" as the encoding, while the original code fragment used the `options` object to determine the encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.O_SYNC
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `O_SYNC` constant from the `fs` module, which is not the same as the `options` object.

DONE.
