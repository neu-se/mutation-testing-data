  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.add
```
This would result in different behavior because `add` is a method that adds a new element to the map, whereas `set` is a method that sets the value of an existing element in the map. If the element does not exist in the map, `set` will create a new element, whereas `add` will throw an error.

DONE.
