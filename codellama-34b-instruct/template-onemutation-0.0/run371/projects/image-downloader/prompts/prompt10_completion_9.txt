  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `path.basename` to extract the filename from the URL, while the new code fragment uses `split` and `pop` to extract the last segment of the URL path, which may not always be the filename.

DONE.
