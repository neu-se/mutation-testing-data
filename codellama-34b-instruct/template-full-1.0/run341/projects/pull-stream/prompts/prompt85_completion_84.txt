  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would first be evaluated as `abort && function () {}` and then as `cb || function () {}`. This could cause the function to be called with an unexpected value for `cb`, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb ? function () {} : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would first be evaluated as `cb ? function () {} : abort` and then as `cb || function () {}`. This could cause the function to be called with an unexpected value for `cb`, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb & function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||`
