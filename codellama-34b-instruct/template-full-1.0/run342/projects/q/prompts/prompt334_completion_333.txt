  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `inspect` is undefined, while the new code fragment calls the `inspect` function and checks if its return value is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `inspect` is a function, while the new code fragment calls the `inspect` function with the promise as its `this` value and checks if its return value is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.bind(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `inspect` is a function, while the new code fragment creates a new function that is bound to the promise and checks if the resulting function is undefined.

DONE.
