 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses the length of the next operation in the current delta, rather than the length of the next operation in the other delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses a length of 0, which could cause the loop to terminate prematurely or result in incorrect data being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses a length of Infinity, which could cause the loop to never terminate or result in incorrect data being processed.

DONE.
