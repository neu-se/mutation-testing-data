  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the truthiness of the "object" variable, potentially causing the code to behave differently for a specific test case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.Ã¡ny
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if "object" has any own properties, which could cause a false negative for a test case that expects the object to have no properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if "object" is an object instance, which could cause a false negative for a test case that expects a different type.

DONE.
