  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of `b[key]` to `null`, regardless of whether it was already `null` or not. In the original code, `b[key]` is only set to `null` if `a[key]` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of `b[key]` to `undefined`, regardless of whether it was already `undefined` or not. In the original code, `b[key]` is only set to `undefined` if `a[key]` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] = a[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of `b[key]` to the value of `a[key]`, regardless of whether it was already
