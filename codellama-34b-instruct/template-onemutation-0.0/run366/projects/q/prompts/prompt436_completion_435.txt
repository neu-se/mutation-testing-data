  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in the array, while `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array. In this case, the code is checking if the `promise` is present in the `unhandledRejections` array, and using `includes` would be more concise and easier to read.
