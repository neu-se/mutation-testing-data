  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function, and `null` is not a function. This change would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function, and `undefined` is not a function. This change would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer() === undefined`, so the `deferred.promise` will be `undefined`. This change would cause the code to throw an error when calling `undefined.resolve()`.

DONE.
