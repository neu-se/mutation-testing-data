Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf('\n') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the newline character is at the start of the chunk instead of checking if it exists anywhere in the chunk, potentially causing the code to skip processing valid data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the chunk is empty rather than checking for the presence of a newline character, which would lead to incorrect handling of non-empty chunks that do not contain newlines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the last newline character is found at any position greater than 0, which would skip processing if the last newline is at the start of the chunk, potentially leading to data loss.

DONE.
