  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter is now `null`, which would cause the `URL.parse()` method to use the current URL as the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter is now an empty string, which would cause the `URL.parse()` method to use an empty string as the base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, 'https://google.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter is now a different URL, which would cause the `URL.parse()` method to use a different base URL.

DONE.
