  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the opLength, which would cause the code to delete one more character than it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be subtracting 1 from the opLength, which would cause the code to delete one fewer character than it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the opLength by 2, which would cause the code to delete twice as many characters as it should.

DONE.
