 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates `Math.cos(2 * b)`, while the mutated code would always result in `Math.cos(0)`, which is a constant value `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] * this['im']
