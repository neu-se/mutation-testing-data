  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `stringify(obj, options)`, which calls the `stringify` function with the `obj` and `options` arguments. However, the new code fragment only calls `stringify` with the `obj` argument, which could result in different behavior if the `options` argument is important for the correctness of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `stringify(obj, options)`, which calls the `stringify` function with the `obj` and `options` arguments. However, the new code fragment calls `JSON.stringify` instead, which could result in different behavior if the `JSON.stringify` function has different behavior than the `stringify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was
