  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, even if there are still operations to be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, even if there are more operations to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute for even-length operations, and would ignore odd-length operations.

DONE.
