Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys().next().value
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the first key from the `_data` map instead of the intended key from the `_queue`, potentially leading to incorrect data being written.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete a `null` key from the `_queue`, which would not match any existing keys, thus leaving the queue unchanged and potentially causing data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the key by appending '1', which would cause the code to attempt to delete a non-existent key from the `_queue`, leading to incorrect behavior in the flushing process.

DONE.
