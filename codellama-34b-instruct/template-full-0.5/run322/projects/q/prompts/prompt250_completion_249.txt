  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the string literal to a tab character, which would affect the output of the `promise.stack` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the string literal to a carriage return character, which would affect the output of the `promise.stack` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the string literal to two newline characters, which would affect the output of the `promise.stack` property.

DONE.
