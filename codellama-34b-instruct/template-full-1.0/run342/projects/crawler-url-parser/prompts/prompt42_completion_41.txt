  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result_normalize_options
```
This would result in different behavior because `result_normalize_options` is an object that is used to configure the normalization of URLs, whereas `baseUrlStr` is a string that represents the base URL of the current page.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid URL string, while `baseUrlStr` is a valid URL string that is used to construct URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrlStr` is the string representation of the current URL, while `baseUrlStr` is the string representation of the base URL.

DONE.
