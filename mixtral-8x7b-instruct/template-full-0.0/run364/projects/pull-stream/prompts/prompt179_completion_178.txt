 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `false` instead of the value from the `cb` function, which could be any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to `cb` is now always `null`, whereas before it could be any value. This could mask errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the value passed to `cb` is now the current index `i`, rather than the current value in the array. This could cause issues if the code downstream relies on the value being the actual value in the array.

DONE.
