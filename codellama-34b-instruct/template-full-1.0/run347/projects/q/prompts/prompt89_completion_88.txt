  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is now being passed as a single argument instead of an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `arguments` object is now being passed instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, [arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is now being passed as an array instead of a single argument.

DONE.
