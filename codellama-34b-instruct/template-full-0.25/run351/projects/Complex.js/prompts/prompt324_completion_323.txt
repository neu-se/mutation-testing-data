  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `sin` function, which is used in the calculation of the `tan` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `cos` function, which is used in the calculation of the `cot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `sin` function, which is used in the calculation of the `tan` function.

DONE.
