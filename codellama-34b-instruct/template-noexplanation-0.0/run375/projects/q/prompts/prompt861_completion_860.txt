  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== void 0
```
This change will cause the `timeout` parameter to be treated as a non-void value, even if it is not explicitly passed to the function. This could potentially cause the `timeout` logic to be executed even if it was not intended to be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout === null
```
This change will cause the `timeout` parameter to be treated as a null value, even if it is not explicitly passed to the function. This could potentially cause the `timeout` logic to be skipped even if it was intended to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout === undefined
```
This change will cause the `timeout` parameter to be treated as an undefined value, even if it is not explicitly passed to the function. This could potentially cause the `timeout` logic to be skipped even if it was intended to be executed.

DONE.
