  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), whereas `min` returns the smallest number in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max
```
This would result in different behavior because `max` returns the largest number in the array, whereas `min` returns the smallest number in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of `Math.floor(offset / 60)`, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the result of `Math.floor(offset / 60)`.

DONE.
