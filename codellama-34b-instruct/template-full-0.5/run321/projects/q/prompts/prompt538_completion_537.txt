  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `this.all` is a property that returns an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, whereas `this.all` is a property that returns an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.reject` is a function that rejects the promise, whereas `this.all` is a property that returns an array of promises.

DONE.
