  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the current `this` context, whereas `makeGenerator` is a reference to the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator.call(this)` calls the `makeGenerator` function with the current `this` context, whereas `makeGenerator` is a reference to the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator.apply(this)` calls the `makeGenerator` function with the current `this` context and an empty argument list, whereas `makeGenerator` is a reference to the original function.

DONE.
