  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter + 1, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack counter would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to incorrectly concatenate the stack trace of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter - 1, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack counter would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to incorrectly concatenate the stack trace of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter * 2, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack counter would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to incorrectly concatenate the stack trace of `promise`.

DONE.
