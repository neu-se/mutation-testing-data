  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(b)` returns the sine of `b`, while `-Math.sin(b)` returns the negative sine of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(b)` returns the cosine of `b`, while `Math.cos(b)` returns the cosine of `b` with the proper type and dimension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * sin(b)` returns the product of `b` and the sine of `b`, while `Math.sin(b)` returns the sine of `b` with a different type and dimension.

DONE.
