  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the `re` property is the real part. Using `x['im']` instead of `x['re']` would cause the `atanh` function to return a different value, which would in turn cause the `acoth` function to return a different value.

DONE.
