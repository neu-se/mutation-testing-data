  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unique
```
This code fragment will negate the result of the `unique` function, causing the `nonUnique` function to pass through all items, regardless of whether they have been seen before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, false)
```
This code fragment will call the `unique` function with the `field` argument set to `false`, which will cause the function to return `false` for all items, regardless of whether they have been seen before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, true)
```
This code fragment will call the `unique` function with the `field` argument set to `true`, which will cause the function to return `true` for all items, regardless of whether they have been seen before.

DONE.
