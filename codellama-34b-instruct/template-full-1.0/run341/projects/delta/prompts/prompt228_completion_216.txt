  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the larger of its two arguments, whereas `Math.min` returns the smaller. This change would cause the `retain` length to be calculated incorrectly in certain cases, potentially leading to errors or inconsistencies in the composed `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of its argument, whereas `Math.min` returns the smaller of its two arguments. This change would cause the `retain` length to be calculated differently in certain cases, which could potentially lead to errors or inconsistencies in the composed `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds its argument to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.min` returns the smaller of its two arguments. This change would cause the `retain
