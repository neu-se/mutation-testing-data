 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>this).get
```
This would result in different behavior because it bypasses type checking and could potentially allow any object with a `get` method to be used, rather than only `Policy` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.get.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of `this` within the `get` method, potentially causing issues if the method relies on accessing other properties or methods of the `PolicyMap` instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
policies.find(p => p.name === name).get
