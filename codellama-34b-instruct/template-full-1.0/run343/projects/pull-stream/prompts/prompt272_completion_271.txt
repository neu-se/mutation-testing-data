  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the `stream` variable from a stream object to a number, which would cause the subsequent call to `values()` to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.isFinished
```
This would result in different behavior because it references a non-existent property `isFinished` on the `stream` object, which would cause an error to be thrown when the code is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the `stream` variable from a stream object to `null`, which would cause the subsequent call to `values()` to fail.

DONE.
