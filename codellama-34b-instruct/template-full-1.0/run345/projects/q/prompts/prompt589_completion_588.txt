  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (makeGenerator) {
    throw new Error("Mock error");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.spawn` function would now throw an error, rather than calling the `makeGenerator` function as it was intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (makeGenerator) {
    return makeGenerator;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.spawn` function would now return the `makeGenerator` function itself, rather than calling it to create a new generator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (makeGenerator) {
    return null;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.spawn` function would now return `null`, rather than a promise for the return value of the generator.

DONE.
