 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check for the 'ENOENT' error code, and instead emit an error for any 'error' event on the read stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createWriteStream(this.path, { flags: 'w' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would open the file in write-only mode, truncating the file and discarding its previous contents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately destroy the write stream, without waiting for any pending writes to complete or the 'drain' event to be emitted.

DONE.
