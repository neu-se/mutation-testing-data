  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert instead of line.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.insert()` is a different method that inserts text at a specific position in the line, whereas `line.push()` appends the text to the end of the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.concat(new Delta(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.concat()` concatenates the text of the line with the text of the `other` argument, while `line.push()` appends the text of the `other` argument to the end of the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.forEach(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.forEach()` iterates over the characters of the line and calls a function for each character, while `line.push()` appends the text of the `other` argument to the end of the line.

DONE.
