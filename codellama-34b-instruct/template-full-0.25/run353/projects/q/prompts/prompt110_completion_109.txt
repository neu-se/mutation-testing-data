  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new fragment checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] > value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new fragment checks for greater than.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] < value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new fragment checks for less than.

DONE.
