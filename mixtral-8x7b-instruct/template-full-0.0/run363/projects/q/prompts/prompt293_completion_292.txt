 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify][Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling `deferred.resolve`, `deferred.reject`, or `deferred.notify` based on the order they are defined, it now chooses one at random. This could cause issues if the order of these calls matters in the rest of the codebase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve.bind(null, 'hacked value')
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the resolved value to the `deferred.resolve` function, it now passes a hardcoded string 'hacked value'. This could cause issues if the rest of the codebase relies on the resolved value being of a certain type or having certain properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { deferred.resolve; deferred.reject
