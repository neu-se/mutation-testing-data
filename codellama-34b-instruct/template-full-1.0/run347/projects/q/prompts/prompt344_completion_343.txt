  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would return the value of the promise if it had already been resolved, but by replacing it with `null`, the promise would always be resolved with a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("FAKE ERROR"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would return the value of the promise if it had already been resolved, but by replacing it with `Promise.reject(new Error("FAKE ERROR"))`, the promise would always be rejected with the given error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would return the value of the promise if it had already been resolved, but by replacing it with `Q(value).then(function() { return null; })`, the
