  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"concatedStacks".trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.trim()` method would remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string, which could potentially cause the filtering function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"concatedStacks".substring(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.substring()` method would only take the first 10 characters of the string, which could potentially cause the filtering function to miss important information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"concatedStacks".replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.replace()` method would remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the string, which could potentially cause the filtering function to remove important information.

DONE.
