  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the latitude instead of the sine of the angular distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the latitude instead of the sine of the angular distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosδ - sinφ1 * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the angular distance instead of the sine of the angular distance.

DONE.
