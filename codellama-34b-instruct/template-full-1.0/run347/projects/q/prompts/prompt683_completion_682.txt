  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dummy"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a rejected promise with "dummy" as the rejection reason, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var name = "John Doe";
name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a resolved promise with the value "John Doe", regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (isPromise(object)) {
return object;
} else {
return Q(object);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only wrap non-promise values in a promise, and would otherwise return the promise as is.

DONE.
