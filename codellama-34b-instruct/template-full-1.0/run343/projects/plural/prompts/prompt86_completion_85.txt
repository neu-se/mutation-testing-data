  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'peoples')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural of "person" to be "peoples" instead of "people".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'people', 'People')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new rule for the plural of "person" to be "people" and also change the function to include a new parameter for the plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', ['people', 'peoples'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new rule for the plural of "person" to be either "people" or "peoples".

DONE.
