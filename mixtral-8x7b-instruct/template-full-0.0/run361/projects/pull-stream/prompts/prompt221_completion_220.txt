 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value from the `asyncMap` function would change, potentially causing tests to fail that are checking for specific return values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the current execution context, which could cause errors if the context is not what is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `map` function to be called twice on the same data, potentially causing side effects or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
