  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + n
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce an offset `n` to the bearing calculation, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
π/2 - θ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reflect the bearing around the π/2 axis, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the bearing, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
