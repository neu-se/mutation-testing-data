  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the first point instead of the latitude of the second point, which is what the original code fragment was using.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the second point instead of the latitude of the second point, which is what the original code fragment was using.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the first point instead of the latitude of the second point, which is what the original code fragment was using.

DONE.
