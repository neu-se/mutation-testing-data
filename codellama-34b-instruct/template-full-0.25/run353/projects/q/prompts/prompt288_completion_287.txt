  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called instead of `become(reject(reason))`, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately instead of being fulfilled with a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(Q.reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called with a rejected promise instead of a resolved promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would be called instead of `become(reject(reason))`, which would cause the promise to be notified of a rejection instead of being fulfilled with a rejected promise.

DONE.
