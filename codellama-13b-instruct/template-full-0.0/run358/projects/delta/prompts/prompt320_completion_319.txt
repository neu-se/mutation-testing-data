  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op.retain` property is a number, and the `AttributeMap.transform` method expects an object as its second argument. This would cause an error to be thrown when the method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op.attributes` property is an object, and the `AttributeMap.transform` method expects an object as its second argument. This would cause the method to return a transformed version of the `op.attributes` object, rather than the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op.insert` property is a string, and the `AttributeMap.transform` method expects an object as its second argument. This would cause an error to be thrown when the method is called.

DONE.
