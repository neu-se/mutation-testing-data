  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is not a valid parameter for the `done` method, while `progress` is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress()
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress()` is a function call, while `progress` is a parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress + 1` is an arithmetic expression, while `progress` is a parameter.

DONE.
