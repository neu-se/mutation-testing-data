  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would always return the value of `abort`, while the mutated code fragment `abort ? null : abort` would return `null` if `abort` is truthy, and `abort` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would always return the value of `abort`, while the mutated code fragment `!abort` would return the negation of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would always return the value of `abort`, while the mutated code fragment `abort === true ? null : abort` would return `null` if `abort` is strictly equal to `true`, and
