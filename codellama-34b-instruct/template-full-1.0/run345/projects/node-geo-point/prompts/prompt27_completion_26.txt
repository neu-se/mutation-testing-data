  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value,
and `calculateDistance` will return 0 instead of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a falsy value,
and `calculateDistance` will return NaN instead of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because `calculateDistance`
will return a negative number, which would result in the Player being
placed on the opposite side of the globe.

DONE.
