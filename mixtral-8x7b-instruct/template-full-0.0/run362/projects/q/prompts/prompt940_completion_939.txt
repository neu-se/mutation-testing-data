 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object using the slice method of the Array prototype, while the original code uses a hypothetical `array_slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly passes the arguments object instead of converting it to an array. This could cause issues if the function being called expects an actual array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat.apply([], arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates all the arguments into a single array using the concat method of the Array prototype and the apply method. This could cause issues if the function being called expects multiple arguments instead of a single array.

DONE.
