  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create()
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.create()` creates a new archiver instance, whereas `archiver` is a reference to the existing archiver instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create({})
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.create({})` creates a new archiver instance with an empty options object, whereas `archiver` is a reference to the existing archiver instance with its own options object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create({}, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.create({}, {})` creates a new archiver instance with two empty options objects, whereas `archiver` is a reference to the existing archiver instance with its own options object.

DONE.
