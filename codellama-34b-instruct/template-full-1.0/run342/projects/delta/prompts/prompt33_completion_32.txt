  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] === undefined || base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, so the key would be considered changed even if it's undefined in both `attr` and `base`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] === base[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the key changed only if it's equal in both `attr` and `base`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(attr[key] === base[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the key changed if it's not equal in both `attr` and `base`.

DONE.
