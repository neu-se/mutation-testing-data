  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring` would return a substring of `w` starting from the specified index, whereas `w.substr` would return a substring of `w` starting from the specified index with the specified length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice` would return a substring of `w` starting from the specified index, whereas `w.substr` would return a substring of `w` starting from the specified index with the specified length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string with the last two characters of `w` removed and replaced with 'es', whereas the original code would return a string with the last character of `w` removed and replaced with 'es'.

DONE.
