  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `test` function with the `data` argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment that simply returns the `test` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `test` function with the `data` argument and the `true` argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment that simply returns the `test` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `test` function with the `data` argument and the `false` argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment that simply returns the `test` object.

DONE.
