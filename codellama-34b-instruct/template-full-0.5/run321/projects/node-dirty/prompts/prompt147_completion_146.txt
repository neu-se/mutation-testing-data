  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate infinitely, as the `cb` function would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => { throw new Error(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to throw an error, which would terminate the loop and prevent any further iterations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => { return; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to stop iterating after the first iteration, as the `cb` function would return a value of `undefined`, which would be interpreted as a falsy value.

DONE.
