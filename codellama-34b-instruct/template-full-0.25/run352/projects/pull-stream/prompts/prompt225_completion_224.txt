  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot
```
This would result in different behavior because `filterNot` is a different function than `filter`, and it would change the behavior of the `filterNot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `!filter` is a different expression than `filter`, and it would change the behavior of the `filterNot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter(data)` is a different expression than `filter`, and it would change the behavior of the `filterNot` function.

DONE.
