  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!s
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the expression, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `s`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `s` by 2, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

DONE.
