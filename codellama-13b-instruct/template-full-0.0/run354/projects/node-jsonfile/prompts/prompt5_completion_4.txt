  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `universalify.fromCallback` function would be called with an additional argument `null`, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `universalify.fromCallback` function would be called with an additional argument `undefined`, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `universalify.fromCallback` function would be called with an additional argument `{}`, which would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
