  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter would cause the `query` property of the returned URL object to be excluded, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter would cause the `search` property of the returned URL object to be excluded, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` parameter would cause the `search` property of the returned URL object to be included, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

DONE.
