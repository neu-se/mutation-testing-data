  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` method is used instead of `delete` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` method is used instead of `delete` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is used, but it is used on the `queue` object instead of the `data` object.

DONE.
