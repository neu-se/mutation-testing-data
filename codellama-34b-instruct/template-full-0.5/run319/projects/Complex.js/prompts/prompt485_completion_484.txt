  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof exports` would return `'object'` when `exports` is an object, but `!== 'object'` would check for the opposite, i.e., when `exports` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof exports` would return `'function'` when `exports` is a function, but `!== 'function'` would check for the opposite, i.e., when `exports` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof exports` would return `'undefined'` when `exports` is not defined, but `!== 'undefined'` would check for the opposite, i.e., when `exports` is defined.

DONE.
