 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.exp` raises e to the power of the real part of the complex number, while the modified code raises e to the power of 2, which is a constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.exp` calculates the exponential function of a number, while the modified code returns the mathematical constant e, which is the base of the natural logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.exp` raises e to the power of the real part of the complex number, while the modified code calculates the natural logarithm of the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
