  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the `Delta` class, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `attributes` property of the `Delta` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delta` variable refers to the `Delta` instance that is being composed, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `attributes` property of the `Delta` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other` variable refers to the `Delta` instance that is being composed with, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `attributes` property of the `Delta` class.

DONE.
