  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg !== 'string' || arg.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a string and has length 0, while the new code fragment checks if the argument is not a string or has length greater than 0. These checks are not equivalent, and the new code fragment may produce different results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg !== 'string' && arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a string and has length 0, while the new code fragment checks if the argument is not a string and has length equal to 0. These checks are not equivalent, and the new code fragment may produce different results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === 'string' || arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a string
