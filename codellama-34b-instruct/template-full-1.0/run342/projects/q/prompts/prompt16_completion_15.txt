  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== true && typeof self !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a boolean value in the `else` block, instead of a reference to the global object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" || typeof self !== " undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a comparison operator other than `!==`, which could produce a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" || typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the same comparison operator but swap the order of the operands, which could also produce a different value.

DONE.
