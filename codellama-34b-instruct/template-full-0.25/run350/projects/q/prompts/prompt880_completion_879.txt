  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, and passing `null` would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, and passing an empty function would cause it to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(err, result) { return result; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, and passing a function that always returns its second argument would cause it to return a different value.

DONE.
