  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'$$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression will now match the end of the string instead of the start.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression will now match a backslash instead of the start of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression will now match any character instead of the start of the string.

DONE.
