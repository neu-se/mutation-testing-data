 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function context, potentially causing issues with variable scoping or closure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the data passed to the callback, which might not be expected by the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _read)
```
This would result in different behavior because it exposes the internal `_read` variable, which might not be intended to be shared with the callback.

DONE.
