Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/index.html"
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the last part of the path with "/index.html" instead of removing it, which would change the comparison logic and potentially lead to incorrect type categorization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "abc"
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the last part of the path with a constant string "abc", which would not accurately reflect the original path structure and could lead to false positives in the type determination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, linkurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the last part of the path with the entire `linkurl_path`, effectively making the comparison always true if `linkurl_path` is not empty, which would disrupt the intended logic of determining the relationship between the URLs.

DONE.
