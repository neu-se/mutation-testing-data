  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a while loop with a condition that depends on the length of the ops, while the modified code uses a for loop with a condition that depends on the index variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a while loop with a condition that depends on the length of the ops, while the modified code uses a for loop with a condition that depends on the index variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length - index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a while loop with a condition that depends on the length of the ops, while the modified code uses a for loop with a condition that depends on the index variable.

DONE.
