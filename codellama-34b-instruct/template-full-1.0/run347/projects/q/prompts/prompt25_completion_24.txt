  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingleTask
```
This would result in different behavior because `runSingleTask` is a different function than `runSingle`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle();
```
This would result in different behavior because `runSingle` is a function that takes no arguments, and `runSingleTask` is a variable that is not defined in the given code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(task);
```
This would result in different behavior because `runSingleTask` is a different function than `runSingle`, and `runSingleTask` is not defined in the given code snippet.

DONE.
