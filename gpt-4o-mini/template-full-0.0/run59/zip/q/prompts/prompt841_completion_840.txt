Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with the promise's fulfillment value instead of handling the error, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `void 0` would change the behavior of the promise chain, as it would not properly handle the fulfillment case, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be invoked for both fulfillment and rejection cases, which is not the intended behavior and could lead to incorrect error handling.

DONE.
