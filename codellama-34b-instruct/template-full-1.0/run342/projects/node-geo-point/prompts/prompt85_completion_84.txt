  Sure, here are three different ways to mutate the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude 
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.longitude` is always equal to the current longitude, while `φ1` can be different depending on the latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude.toFixed(5) 
```
This would result in different behavior because `toFixed(5)` rounds the longitude to 5 decimal places, while `φ1` can have a higher precision.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(this.longitude) 
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin()` returns the sine of the longitude in radians, while `φ1` represents the y-coordinate of a point on the Earth's surface.

DONE.
