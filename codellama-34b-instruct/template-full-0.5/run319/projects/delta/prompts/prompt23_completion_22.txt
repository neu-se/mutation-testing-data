  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] = b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `b[key]` to `a[key]`, rather than comparing them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]`, rather than assigning the value of `b[key]` to `a[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value `null` to `a[key]`, rather than comparing it to `b[key]`.

DONE.
