  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas the original code fragment was using the `reverse()` method to remove the last element from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element from the array, whereas the original code fragment was using the `reverse()` method to remove the last element from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes the first element from the array, whereas the original code fragment was using the `reverse()` method to remove the last element from the array.

DONE.
