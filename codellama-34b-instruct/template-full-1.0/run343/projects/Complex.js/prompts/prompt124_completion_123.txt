  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the entire complex number is infinite, instead of just the divisor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z["re"] !== 0 && z["im"] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real and imaginary parts of the divisor are both non-zero, instead of checking if the divisor is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z["re"] - z["im"] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real and imaginary parts of the divisor are both non-zero and of the same sign, instead of just checking if the divisor is infinite.

DONE.
