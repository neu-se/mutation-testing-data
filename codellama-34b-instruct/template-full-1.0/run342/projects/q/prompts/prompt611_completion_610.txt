  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a different method than "get", and would return a promise for the result of setting the property instead of getting its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because "apply" is a different method than "get", and would call the function on the object with the provided arguments instead of returning its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because "throw" is a different method than "get", and would throw an error instead of returning the value of the property.

DONE.
