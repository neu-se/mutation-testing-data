  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would be called with the same arguments as before, but the `rule.query` method would be called with a different set of arguments, which could result in a different return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx.path` property would be used instead of the original `path` argument, which could affect the outcome of the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx.verb` property would be used instead of the original `verb` argument, which could affect the outcome of the `query` method.

DONE.
