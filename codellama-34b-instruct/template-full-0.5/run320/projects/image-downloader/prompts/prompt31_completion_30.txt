  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method would remove the first 10 characters from the `url` string, regardless of whether they are whitespace or not, which could potentially change the URL that is being requested.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight(10).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimRight` method would remove the last 10 characters from the `url` string, regardless of whether they are whitespace or not, which could potentially change the URL that is being requested.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(10).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would remove the first 10 characters from the `url` string, regardless of whether they are whitespace or not, which could potentially change the URL that is being requested.
