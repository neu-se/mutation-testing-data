  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `setImmediate` function to schedule the callback to be called asynchronously, while the new code fragment is calling the callback synchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `setImmediate` function to schedule the callback to be called asynchronously, while the new code fragment is calling the callback synchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `setImmediate` function to schedule the callback to be called asynchronously, while the new code fragment is calling the callback synchronously.

DONE.
