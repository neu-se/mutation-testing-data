  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator performs concatenation on strings, whereas the original code uses the `===` operator to check for strict equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.indexOf("1")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method searches for a specific value within a string, whereas the original code uses the `===` operator to check for strict equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase` method converts the entire string to lowercase, whereas the original code uses the `===` operator to check for strict equality.

DONE.
