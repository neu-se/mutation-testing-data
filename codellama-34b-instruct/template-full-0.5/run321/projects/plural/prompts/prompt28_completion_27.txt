  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a different substring, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a different substring, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a different substring, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
