  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply", and it would cause the function to be invoked with the specified `this` value and arguments provided individually.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" is a different method than "apply", and it would return a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function was called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply" + "call"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the strings "apply" and "call", resulting in the string "applycall", which is not a valid method name.

DONE.
