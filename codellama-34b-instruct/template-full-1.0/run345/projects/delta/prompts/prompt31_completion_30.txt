  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the own enumerable string-keyed properties of the given object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of the own enumerable string-keyed properties of the given object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs of the given object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of the own enumerable string-keyed properties of the given object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` returns the given object with the given properties assigned, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of the own enumerable string-keyed properties of the given object.
