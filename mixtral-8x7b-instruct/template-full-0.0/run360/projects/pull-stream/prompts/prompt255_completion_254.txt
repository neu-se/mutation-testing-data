 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextStream` function would not be called, and the function would return immediately, causing the stream to stop emitting data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` would be called immediately, regardless of whether or not there is data to be read from the current stream. This could cause the function to skip over data or enter an infinite loop if the current stream never ends.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(nextStream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` would ensure that `nextStream` is only called once, even if it is called multiple times. This could cause the function to skip over data or enter an infinite loop if the current stream never ends.

DONE.
