  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` calculates the inverse cosine of a number, whereas `Math.cos` calculates the cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` calculates the sine of a number, whereas `Math.cos` calculates the cosine of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` calculates the tangent of a number, whereas `Math.cos` calculates the cosine of a number.

DONE.
