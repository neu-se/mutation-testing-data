  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.pop
```
This change will cause the `array_map` function to return an array with one less element than the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.shift
```
This change will cause the `array_map` function to return an array with the first element removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.unshift
```
This change will cause the `array_map` function to return an array with the first element added.

DONE.
