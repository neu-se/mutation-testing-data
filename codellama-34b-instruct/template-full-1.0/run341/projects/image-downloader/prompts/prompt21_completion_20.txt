  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, options.dest);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `path.join` function to be called with the same argument twice, which could potentially result in a different return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, basename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `path.join` function to be called with a different argument than the original code fragment, which could potentially result in a different return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest = path.join(options.dest, options.url);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `path.join` function to be called with a different argument than the original code fragment, which could potentially result in a different return value.

DONE.
