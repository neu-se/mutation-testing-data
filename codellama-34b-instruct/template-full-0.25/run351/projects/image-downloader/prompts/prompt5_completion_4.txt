  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('A different error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('The options.dest is required'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is the same as the original code, but the error object is a different instance.

DONE.
