 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method without a callback will prevent further writes to the stream until `uncork` is called, but the original code fragment uses a placeholder for the number of arguments to be passed to `cork`. This change may cause the program to behave unexpectedly, depending on the implementation of the `_flush` method and the rest of the codebase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.cork(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a placeholder for the number of arguments to be passed to `cork`. By replacing it with a constant value, such as `1`, the behavior of the `cork` method will change, potentially causing issues in the data written to the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.cork(() => {});
```
