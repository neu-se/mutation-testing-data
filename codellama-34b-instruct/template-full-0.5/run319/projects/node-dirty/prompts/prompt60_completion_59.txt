  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream` is a writable stream, while `this._readStream` is a readable stream. Using `this._writeStream` would cause the code to write to the file instead of reading from it, which would likely cause errors and unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is a Map object, while `this._readStream` is a readable stream. Using `this._data` would cause the code to access the in-memory cache instead of reading from the file, which would likely cause errors and unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue` is a Map object, while `this._readStream` is a readable stream. Using `this._queue` would cause the code to access the queue of pending writes instead of
