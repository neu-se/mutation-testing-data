  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, skipping the first token.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < tokens.length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop at the second-to-last token instead of the last token.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < tokens.length; i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other token, potentially causing the parser to miss important information.

DONE.
