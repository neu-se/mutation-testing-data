Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round both latitude and longitude to zero decimal places, effectively truncating all decimal precision instead of adjusting it based on the specified precision.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always convert the precision to a positive value, potentially leading to unexpected results if a negative precision value is passed, which would not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the precision by one, causing the latitude and longitude to be rounded to one more decimal place than intended, thus affecting the accuracy of the GeoPoint representation.

DONE.
