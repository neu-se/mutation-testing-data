  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value of the first argument passed to the function, rather than the resolved value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the error passed as an argument to the function, rather than resolving it with the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send a notification with the value of the first argument passed to the function, rather than resolving the promise with the resolved value of the promise.

DONE.
