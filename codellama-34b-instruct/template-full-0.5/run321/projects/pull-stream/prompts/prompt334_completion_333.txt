  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || null
```
This would result in different behavior because `end || null` is always truthy, so the `else` branch would never be executed, even if `end` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && null
```
This would result in different behavior because `end && null` is always falsy, so the `if` branch would never be executed, even if `end` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? null : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would always evaluate to `null`, regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
