  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_defineProperty(error, "stack", {value: stack, configurable: true});

```
object_defineProperty(error, "stack", {value: stack, enumerable: true});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `enumerable` property is set to `true`, which means the property
