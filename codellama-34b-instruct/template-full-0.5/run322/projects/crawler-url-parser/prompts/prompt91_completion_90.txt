  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|file:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the "file:" protocol, which is a valid protocol for a URL. By adding "file:" to the list of protocols, the code would consider URLs with the "file:" protocol as valid, while the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|data:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the "data:" protocol, which is a valid protocol for a URL. By adding "data:" to the list of protocols, the code would consider URLs with the "data:" protocol as valid, while the original code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|http:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because
