  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`. In the original code, if `err` is a truthy value other than `true`, such as an object or an array, the `nextStream` function would be called with the `err` value as an argument. In the new code, the `nextStream` function would only be called with `null` as an argument if `err` is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass the `err` value to the `nextStream` function if `err` is strictly equal to `true`. In the new code, the `err` value would be passed to the `nextStream` function as an argument if `err` is strictly equal
