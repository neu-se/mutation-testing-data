  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the contents of the `src` directory, whereas the original code fragment only includes the contents of the `src` directory if `src` is a directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, { dereference: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would dereference symbolic links, whereas the original code fragment does not dereference symbolic links.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, { exclude: ['**/.*'] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude files and directories that start with a dot, whereas the original code fragment includes all files and directories.

DONE.
