  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it will generate a random key instead of using the provided key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will check if the key is null, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it will convert the key to a string, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
