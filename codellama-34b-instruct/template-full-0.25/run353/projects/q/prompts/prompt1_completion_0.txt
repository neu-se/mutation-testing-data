  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `bootstrap` is a function, while this replacement checks if it is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `bootstrap` is a function, while this replacement checks if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `bootstrap` is a function, while this replacement checks if it is an object.

DONE.
