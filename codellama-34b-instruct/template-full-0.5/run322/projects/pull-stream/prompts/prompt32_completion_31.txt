  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `pull` function to be called with an additional argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `pull` function to be called with one less argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `pull` function to be called with twice as many arguments, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
