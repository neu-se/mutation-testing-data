  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 360` would cause the bearing to always be positive, whereas the original code fragment would return a bearing between 0 and 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 360` would cause the bearing to always be negative, whereas the original code fragment would return a bearing between 0 and 360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the bearing to be twice as large as the original, whereas the original code fragment would return a bearing between 0 and 360 degrees.

DONE.
