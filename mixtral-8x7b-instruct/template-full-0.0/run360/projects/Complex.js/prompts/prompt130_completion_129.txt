 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if either `this` or `z` is infinite, instead of both being infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both `this` and `z` are zero, which is the opposite of checking if both are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!this['isFinite']() && !z['isFinite']()
