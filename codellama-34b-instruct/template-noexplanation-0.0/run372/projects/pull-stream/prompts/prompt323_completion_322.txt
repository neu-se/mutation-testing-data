  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd()
```
This change will cause the `onEnd` function to be called immediately, rather than being passed as an argument to the `once` function. This will likely cause the `once` function to behave differently than intended, and may result in the test suite failing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(null)
```
This change will cause the `onEnd` function to be called with a `null` argument, rather than being passed as an argument to the `once` function. This will likely cause the `once` function to behave differently than intended, and may result in the test suite failing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(undefined)
```
This change will cause the `onEnd` function to be called with an `undefined` argument, rather than being passed as an argument to the `once` function. This will likely cause the `once` function to behave differently than intended, and may result in the test suite failing.
