  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the policy name to uppercase, which may not match the expected policy name in the test cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the policy name, which may not match the expected length in the test cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the policy name, which may not match the expected policy name in the test cases.

DONE.
