  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof <PLACEHOLDER> === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the input is an object and then checks its properties, while this modified code checks if the input is a number and then casts it to an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the input is an object and then checks its properties, while this modified code adds 1 to the input and then checks its properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty(<PLACEHOLDER>) &&
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the input is an object and then checks its properties, while this modified code checks if the input is an object and then checks if it has the properties "type" and "coordinates".

DONE.
