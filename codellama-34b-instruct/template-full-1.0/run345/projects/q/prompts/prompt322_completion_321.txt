  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `fulfilled` function, whereas the original code fragment passes all the arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the second argument to the `fulfilled` function, whereas the original code fragment passes all the arguments as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the arguments starting from the second argument to the `fulfilled` function, whereas the original code fragment passes all the arguments as an array.

DONE.
