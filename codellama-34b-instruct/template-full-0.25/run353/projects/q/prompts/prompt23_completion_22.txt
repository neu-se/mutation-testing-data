  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit()` would be called twice in the `runSingle` function, which could cause issues if the domain is not properly set up.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.enter()` would be called twice in the `runSingle` function, which could cause issues if the domain is not properly set up.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.run(task)
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.run(task)` would be called instead of `domain.enter()` and `domain.exit()`, which could cause issues if the domain is not properly set up.

DONE.
