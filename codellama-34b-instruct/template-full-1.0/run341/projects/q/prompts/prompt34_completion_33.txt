  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and therefore the `runSingle` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.call;
```
This would result in different behavior because `task.call` would return the `call` method of the `task` object, which is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `task.call()` would execute the `call` method of the `task` object, which would likely result in an error since `task` is not a function.

DONE.
