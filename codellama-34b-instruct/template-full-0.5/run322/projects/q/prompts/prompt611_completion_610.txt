  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation would be replaced with the `set` operation, which would cause the promise to resolve with the value of the property instead of returning a promise for the property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation would be replaced with the `delete` operation, which would cause the promise to resolve with `undefined` instead of returning a promise for the property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation would be replaced with the `post` operation, which would cause the promise to resolve with the return value of the `post` method instead of returning a promise for the property value.

DONE.
