 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would cause a division by zero error when `a` is 0, while the original code fragment would return `-Infinity` or `NaN` depending on the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would always return a positive value, while the original code fragment could return a negative value when `b` is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would always use the real part of the complex number, while the original code fragment uses the value of the `a` variable, which could be different.

DONE.
