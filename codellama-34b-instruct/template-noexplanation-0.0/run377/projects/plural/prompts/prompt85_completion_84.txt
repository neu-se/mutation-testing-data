  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
```
This code fragment is a simple typo, where the first argument is the same as the second argument. This will cause the `addRule` function to add a rule that maps the word "mice" to itself, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mouse'
```
This code fragment is a more subtle bug, where the first argument is the plural form of the word, but the second argument is the singular form. This will cause the `addRule` function to add a rule that maps the plural form of the word to the singular form, which is also not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mouses'
```
This code fragment is a more obvious bug, where the first argument is the plural form of the word, but the second argument is a made-up word that is not the intended plural form.
