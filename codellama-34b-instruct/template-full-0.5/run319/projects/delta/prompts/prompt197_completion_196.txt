  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = typeof otherOp.retain === 'number' ? length : otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the wrong number of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = typeof otherOp.retain === 'number' ? length : otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the wrong number of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = typeof otherOp.retain === 'number' ? length : otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the wrong number of characters.

DONE.
