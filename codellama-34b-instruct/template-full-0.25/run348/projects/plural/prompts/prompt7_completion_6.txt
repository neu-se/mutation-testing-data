  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the `rules` array, causing the `plural` function to always return the original word instead of applying any of the rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of the array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
