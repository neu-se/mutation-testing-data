  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const lo = 0 - <PLACEHOLDER>()
```
This would result in a negative usage of the given placeholder function, and would cause the inserted text to have a negative length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>() + 1
```
This would shift the window of the index being considered to start from the next character after the index, potentially causing indexing errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>() > Indexing.LENGTH_MAX - 1 ? 0 : <PLACEHOLDER>() + 1
```
This would cause the inserted text to have a length of 0 when the placeholder exceeds the maximum length of a Delta, resulting in an incorrect Delta being generated.

DONE.
