  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `void 0` is a special value that represents an undefined value in JavaScript.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `void 0` is a special value that represents an undefined value in JavaScript.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a special value that represents an undefined value in JavaScript, and `null` and `undefined` are primitive values.

DONE.
