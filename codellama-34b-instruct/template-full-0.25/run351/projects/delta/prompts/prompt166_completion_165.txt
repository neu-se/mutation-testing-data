  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekType()` would return the type of the next operation in the iterator, which could be different from the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` would return the type of the next operation in the other iterator, which could be different from the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the next operation in the iterator, which could be different from the current operation.

DONE.
