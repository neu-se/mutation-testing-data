  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.message` is a string, while `error` is an object. The original code fragment throws an error object, while the new code fragment throws a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Can't get value from closed queue")
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error("Can't get value from closed queue")` is a different error object than `error`. The original code fragment throws an error object with a specific message, while the new code fragment throws a different error object with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an error object, while `error` is. The original code fragment throws an error object, while the new code fragment does not throw an error object.

DONE.
