  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options, 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the encoding option, which could cause issues with the file reading and writing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options, 'base64'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the encoding option, which could cause issues with the file reading and writing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options, 'hex'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the encoding option, which could cause issues with the file reading and writing.

DONE.
