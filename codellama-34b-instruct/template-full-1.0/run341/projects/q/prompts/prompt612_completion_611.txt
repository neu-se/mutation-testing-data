  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.get(object, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, which would not match the key of any property in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.get(object, key * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to get the property with a key that is twice the original key value, which may not exist in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.get(object, key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to get the property with a key that is one greater than the original key value, which may not exist in the object.

DONE.
