  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+?)'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` makes the `+` quantifier non-greedy, which means it will match the shortest possible string instead of the longest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+{2})'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{2}` quantifier makes the `+` quantifier match exactly two characters, which is different from the original behavior of matching one or more characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+{2,})'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{2,}` quantifier makes the `+` quantifier match at least two characters, which is different from the original behavior of matching one or more characters.

DONE.
