 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the constructor form of the Promise instead of the Q library, potentially causing issues with the rest of the code that relies on Q's specific methods and behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an empty array instead of a promise, causing issues with any code that expects a promise and calls methods like `.then()` or `.nodeify()` on the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ then: function() {} }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an object with an empty `then` method instead of a promise, causing issues with any code that expects a promise and calls methods like `.then()` or `.nodeify()` on the result.

DONE.
