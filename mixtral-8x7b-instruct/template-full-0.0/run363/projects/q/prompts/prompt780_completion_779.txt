 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
    return {};
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would be called on an empty object instead of the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
    return Q.resolve();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a promise that is immediately fulfilled, so the `inspect` method would be called on a fulfilled promise instead of the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
    return Q.reject();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a promise that is immediately rejected, so the `inspect` method would not be called at all.

DONE.
