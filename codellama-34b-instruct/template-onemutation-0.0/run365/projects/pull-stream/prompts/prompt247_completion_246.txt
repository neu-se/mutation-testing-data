  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(err && abort), cb`, which would only call `cb` if both `err` and `abort` are truthy. In contrast, the original code fragment would call `cb` if either `err` or `abort` is truthy.

DONE.
