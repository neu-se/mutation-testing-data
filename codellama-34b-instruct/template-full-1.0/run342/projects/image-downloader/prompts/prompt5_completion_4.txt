  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` will reject the promise with the given error, while `Promise.resolve` will resolve the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` will reject the promise with the given error, while `null` will resolve the promise with no value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` will reject the promise with the given error, while `0` will resolve the promise with the value `0`.

DONE.
