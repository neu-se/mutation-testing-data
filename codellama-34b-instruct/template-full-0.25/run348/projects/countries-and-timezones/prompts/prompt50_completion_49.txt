  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `id` argument, which would return a timezone object with the specified `id`, rather than iterating over all the timezones and calling `getTimezone` for each one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly access the `timezones` object with the specified `id`, rather than calling the `getTimezone` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezone` function with the `data` and `id` arguments, which would return a timezone object with the specified `id`, rather than calling the `getTimezone` function.

DONE.
