Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `src` string is empty instead of verifying if it is a glob pattern, which would lead to incorrect handling of valid glob patterns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the original check, causing the code to treat glob patterns as regular strings and potentially skip the glob processing altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the `src` string contains an asterisk, which is a common character in glob patterns, but does not comprehensively validate the entire glob pattern, leading to incorrect processing of valid glob inputs.

DONE.
