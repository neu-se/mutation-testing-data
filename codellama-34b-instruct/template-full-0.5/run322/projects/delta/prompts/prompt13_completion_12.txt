  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.hasOwnProperty` returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names.

DONE.
