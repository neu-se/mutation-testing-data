 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value from the mutated code now includes the addition of 1, whereas the original code returns the data as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value from the mutated code is now a string, whereas the original code returns the data in its original format (which could be an object, array, string, number, etc.).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value from the mutated code now depends on the mapper function, whereas the original code returns the data as is (unless the mapper function was provided, in which case the returned value would be the result of applying the mapper function to the data).

DONE.
