  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length` would always be truthy, even if the promise is not yet resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length > 0` would only be truthy if the promise is resolved and has at least one message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length === 0` would only be truthy if the promise is resolved and has no messages.

DONE.
