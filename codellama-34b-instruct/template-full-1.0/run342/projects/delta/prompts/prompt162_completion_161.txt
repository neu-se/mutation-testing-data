  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` returns the next Op in the iterator, while `otherIter.next` returns the iterator itself, which would cause the code to enter an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to call the `next` method on `null`, which would cause the code to throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.previous()` returns the previous Op in the iterator, while `otherIter.next` returns the next Op, which would cause the code to iterate over the ops in a different order.

DONE.
