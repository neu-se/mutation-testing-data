  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1).ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(1).ops.length` returns the length of the 'ops' array of the next element in the 'other' iterator, which may not be the same as the length of the current element in the 'this' iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` returns the next element in the 'this' iterator, which may not be the same as the current element in the 'other' iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next((<PLACEHOLDER>$))`
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next((<PLACEHOLDER>$))` sets the next element in the 'other' iterator to the next element in the 'this' iterator, but does not advance the 'this' iterator.
