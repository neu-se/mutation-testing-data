  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are both objects, but they are different objects. The original code fragment checks if they are both the same object, which is not the case here, so the code would continue to the next line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value. The original code fragment checks if `a` is an object, but `null` is not an object, so the code would continue to the next line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is an object, but `undefined` is not an object. The original code fragment checks if `a` is an object, but `undefined` is not an object, so the code would continue to the next line.

DONE.
