  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of a non-zero value, while replacing it with 0 would cause the if statement to always evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of a non-zero value, while replacing it with 1 would cause the if statement to always evaluate to true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of a non-zero value, while replacing it with -1 would cause the if statement to always evaluate to true.

DONE.
