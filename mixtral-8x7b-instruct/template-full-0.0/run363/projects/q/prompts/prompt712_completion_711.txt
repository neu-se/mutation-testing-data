 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(this)` returns an array of the object's own enumerable properties, which is not equivalent to an empty array. This change would cause the `Q.keys` method to behave differently, affecting how the method interacts with the keys of the promised object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, and the `Q.all` method expects an array as its argument. This change would cause the `Q.all` method to fail when processing the input, leading to different behavior compared to the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because a function is being passed instead of an array. This change would cause the `Q.all` method to fail when processing the input
