  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called without any arguments, which would cause the `length` parameter to be set to `Infinity`. This would cause the `next()` method to return the next operation in the `ops` array, regardless of its length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with an argument of `1`, which would cause the `length` parameter to be set to `1`. This would cause the `next()` method to return the next operation in the `ops` array, but only if its length is at least `1`. If the next operation has a length of `0`, the `next()` method would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next(this.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called
