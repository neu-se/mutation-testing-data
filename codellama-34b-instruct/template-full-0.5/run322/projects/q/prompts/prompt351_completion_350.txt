  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` is a function that has not been called in the original code, and it would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.inspect` is a function that has not been called in the original code, and it would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.valueOf` is a function that has not been called in the original code, and it would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
