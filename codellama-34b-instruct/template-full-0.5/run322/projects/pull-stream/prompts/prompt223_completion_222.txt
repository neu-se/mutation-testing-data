  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not the same as the `test` method, and it would cause the `filterNot` function to always return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.pass
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pass` method is not the same as the `test` method, and it would cause the `filterNot` function to always return the opposite of what it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.skip
```
This would result in different behavior because the `skip` method is not the same as the `test` method, and it would cause the `filterNot` function to always return the opposite of what it should.

DONE.
