  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, regardless of the length of the op, which could cause errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 3, regardless of the length of the op, which could cause errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the length of the op, which could cause errors in the code.

DONE.
