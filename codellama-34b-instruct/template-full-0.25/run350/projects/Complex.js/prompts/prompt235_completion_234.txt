  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, which is not the same as the square root of the absolute value of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a - b*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the difference of the squares of `a` and `b`, which is not the same as the square root of the absolute value of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b` plus 1, which is not the same as the square root of the absolute value of `a
