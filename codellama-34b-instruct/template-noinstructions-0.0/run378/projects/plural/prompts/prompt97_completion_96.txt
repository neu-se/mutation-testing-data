  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of "a" with "e", while the new code fragment replaces all occurrences of "a" with "e".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/g, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of "a" with "e", while the new code fragment replaces all occurrences of "a" with "e".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rep
