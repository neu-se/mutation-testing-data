  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `writeFileSync` method of the `_fs` object, which is not the same as the `writeFileSync` method of the `fs` object that is used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `writeFileSync` method of the `fs` object, but with a different set of options than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `writeFileSync` method of the `fs` object with a different encoding option than the original code.

DONE.
