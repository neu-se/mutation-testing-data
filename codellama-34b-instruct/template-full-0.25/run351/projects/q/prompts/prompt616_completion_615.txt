  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to the first argument, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a different object than the original `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `dispatch` method with the `this` context set to `null`, which would cause the method to be called on a different object than the original `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `dispatch` method with the `this` context set to `this` and an empty array of arguments, which would cause the method to be called with different arguments than the original method call.

DONE.
