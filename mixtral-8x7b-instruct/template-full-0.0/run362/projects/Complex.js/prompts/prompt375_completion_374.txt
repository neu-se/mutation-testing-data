 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number, while `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(-a) - Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates `e^(-a) - e^(a)` instead of `(e^a - e^(-a)) / 2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.tan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the reciprocal of the tangent of `a` instead of the hyperbolic cotangent of `a`.

DONE.
