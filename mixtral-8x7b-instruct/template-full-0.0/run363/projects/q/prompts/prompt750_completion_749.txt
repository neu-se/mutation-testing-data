 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise immediately if the input array is empty, instead of waiting for all promises to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise as soon as there is at least one rejected promise, instead of waiting for all promises to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with an error message, regardless of the status of the input promises.

DONE.
