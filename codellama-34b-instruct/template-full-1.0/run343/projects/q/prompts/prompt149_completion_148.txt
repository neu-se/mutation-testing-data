  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stacks.unshift` pushes an element to the beginning of an array, while the replacement code fragment does not modify the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stacks.unshift` pushes an element to the beginning of an array, while the replacement code fragment sets a property of the promise object to a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = () => stacks.unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stacks.unshift` pushes an element to the beginning of an array, while the replacement code fragment sets a property of the promise object to a function that pushes an element to the beginning of an array.

DONE.
