  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `abort` is falsy. This change would cause the function to return a different value in some cases, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.
