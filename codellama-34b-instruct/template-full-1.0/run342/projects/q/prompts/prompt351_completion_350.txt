  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self
```
This would result in different behavior because the `self` variable is not defined in the current scope, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an instance of `Error`, so it would not match the `exception instanceof Error` check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, Q.Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.Promise` is not an instance of `Error`, so it would not match the `exception instanceof Error` check.

DONE.
