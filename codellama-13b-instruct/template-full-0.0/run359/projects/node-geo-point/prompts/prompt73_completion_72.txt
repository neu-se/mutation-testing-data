  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be off by 1 meter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be off by 1 meter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be twice the actual distance.

DONE.
