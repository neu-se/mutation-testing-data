  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof stream !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is a function, while this new code fragment checks if the type of `stream` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is a function, while this new code fragment checks if `stream` is not equal to the string `'function'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!stream.isFunction()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is a function, while this new code fragment checks if the `isFunction()` method of `stream` returns `false`.

DONE.
