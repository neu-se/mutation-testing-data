  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith()` checks if the string starts with the given substring, while `includes()` checks if the string contains the substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.endsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `endsWith()` checks if the string ends with the given substring, while `includes()` checks if the string contains the substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf()` returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring, while `includes()` checks if the substring is contained in the string.

DONE.
