  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `this.all` is a method that returns an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.catch` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the error, whereas `this.all` is a method that returns an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.finally` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the value, whereas `this.all` is a method that returns an array of promises.

DONE.
