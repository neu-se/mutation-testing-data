  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` and `call` are different methods of a function, and they have different behaviors when it comes to the `this` binding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, whereas `apply` and `call` do not change the `this` binding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"every"
```
This would result in different behavior because `every` is a method of an array that checks whether all elements in the array pass a certain test, whereas `apply` and `call` are methods of a function that change the `this` binding and arguments.

DONE.
