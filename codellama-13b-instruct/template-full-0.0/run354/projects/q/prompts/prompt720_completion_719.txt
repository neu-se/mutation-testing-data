  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object, which would not be the same as the original deferred object that was used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.deferred()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object, which would not be the same as the original deferred object that was used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise object, which would not be the same as the original promise object that was used in the original code.

DONE.
