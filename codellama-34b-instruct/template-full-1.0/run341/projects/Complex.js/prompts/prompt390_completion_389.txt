  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the value of `a`, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the value of `a` with the mathematical constant pi, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
