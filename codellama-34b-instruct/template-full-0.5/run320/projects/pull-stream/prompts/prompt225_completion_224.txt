  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `filter` function, which is not the intended behavior of the `filterNot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `filterNot` function with the `data` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the `filter` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `filter` function with the `data` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the `filterNot` function.

DONE.
