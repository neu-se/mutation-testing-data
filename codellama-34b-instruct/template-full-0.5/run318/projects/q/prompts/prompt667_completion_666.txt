  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a new array containing all elements from the original `arguments` array, starting from the second element (index 1), whereas the original code fragment `arguments, 1` would return the second element of the `arguments` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a new array containing all elements from the original `arguments` array, starting from the third element (index 2), whereas the original code fragment `arguments, 1` would return the second element of the `arguments` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a new array containing all elements from the original `arguments` array
