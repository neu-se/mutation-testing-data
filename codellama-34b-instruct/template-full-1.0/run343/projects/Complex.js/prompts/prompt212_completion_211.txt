  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a)/(a*Math.cos(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the logarithm of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, while this code fragment is using the exponential of the angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)/(Math.cos(b)*a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the logarithm of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, while this code fragment is using the sine and cosine of the angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI*Math.cos(b)/(a*Math.sin(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the logarithm of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, while this code fragment is using a constant multiple of the cosine and sine of the angle.

DONE
