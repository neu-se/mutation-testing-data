  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the splice operation would be one higher than the original code, which could lead to the newOp being inserted at the wrong position in the ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the newOp would be inserted at the same position as the original code, but with an additional argument (1) that would be ignored by the splice method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the newOp would be inserted at the same position as the original code, but with an additional argument (0) that would be ignored by the splice method.

DONE.
