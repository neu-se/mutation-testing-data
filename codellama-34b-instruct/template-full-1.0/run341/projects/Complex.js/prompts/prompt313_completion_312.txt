  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with buggy code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` is a sine function, but `cosh` is a hyperbolic cosine function. In the original code, `cosh` is used to calculate the secant of a complex number, but if `sin` is used instead, the calculation would produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is a hyperbolic cosine function, but `1` is a constant value. In the original code, `cosh` is used to calculate the secant of a complex number, but if `1` is used instead, the calculation would produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because `3` is a constant value that is different from the original value of `2
