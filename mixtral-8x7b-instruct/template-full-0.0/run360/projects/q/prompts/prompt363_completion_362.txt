 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would be treated as a rejection, changing the behavior of the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Replacement error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of resolving the promise with a value, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject('Replacement rejection')
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a different reason than the original code, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

DONE.
