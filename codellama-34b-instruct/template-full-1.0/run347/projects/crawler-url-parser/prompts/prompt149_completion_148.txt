  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
	return elem.length > 0
}).join("/");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the path on "/" but does not filter out empty elements, whereas this new code fragment first filters out empty elements before joining the remaining elements with "/". This would cause the code to behave differently when handling URLs with empty path parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
	return elem.length > 1
}).join("/");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out elements with length 0, whereas this new code fragment filters out elements with length 1. This would cause the code to behave differently when handling URLs with path parts of length 0 or 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.
