  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the meaning of the condition, causing the rule to apply to any word that is not equal to the rule's word, rather than only to the rule's word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'Boolean' && rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only apply the rule if the rule's word is a boolean and is true, rather than only if the rule's word is a string and is equal to the current word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only apply the rule if the rule does not have two elements, rather than only if the rule's word is a string and is equal to the current word.

DONE.
