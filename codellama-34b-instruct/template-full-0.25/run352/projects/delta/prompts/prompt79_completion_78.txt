  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.insert` is not null, while this replacement checks if it is null. This could cause the code to behave differently in cases where `newOp.insert` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.insert` is not null, while this replacement checks if it is not undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently in cases where `newOp.insert` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert != 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.insert` is not null, while this replacement checks
