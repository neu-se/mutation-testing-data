  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountryForTimezone(tzName, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` option would be set to `true`, which would cause the function to return the country associated with the given timezone, even if it is deprecated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountryForTimezone(tzName, { allTimezones: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allTimezones` option would be set to `true`, which would cause the function to return all the countries associated with the given timezone, even if they are deprecated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountryForTimezone(tzName, { allTimezones: true, deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because both the `allTimezones` and `deprecated` options would be set to `true`, which would cause the function to return all the countries associated with the given timezone
