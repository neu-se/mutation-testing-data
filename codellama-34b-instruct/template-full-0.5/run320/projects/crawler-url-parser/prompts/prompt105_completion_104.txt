  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the text is null, while the new code fragment is checking the length of the text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the text is null, while the new code fragment is converting the text to lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the text is null, while the new code fragment is reversing the text.

DONE.
