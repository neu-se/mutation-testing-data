  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that merges two or more arrays, whereas `chop` is a method that removes a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `chop` is a method that removes a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a method that adds/removes items to/from an array, whereas `chop` is a method that removes a portion of an array.

DONE.
