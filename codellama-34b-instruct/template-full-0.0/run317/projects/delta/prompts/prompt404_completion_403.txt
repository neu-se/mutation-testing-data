  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData.length` is a number, while `otherData` is an object. This would cause the `transform` method to behave differently when it encounters an object with a `length` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData.length + 1` is a number that is always greater than `otherData.length`, which would cause the `transform` method to behave differently when it encounters an object with a `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData.length - 1` is a number that is always less than `otherData.length`, which would cause the `transform` method to behave differently when it encounters an object with a `length` property.
