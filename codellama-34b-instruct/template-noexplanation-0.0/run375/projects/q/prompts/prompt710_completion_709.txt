  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [])
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses the "keys" method instead of "dispatch". This could potentially cause issues if the "keys" method is not defined for the object, or if it has a different behavior than "dispatch".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("values", [])
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses the "values" method instead of "dispatch". This could potentially cause issues if the "values" method is not defined for the object, or if it has a different behavior than "dispatch".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("entries", [])
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses the "entries" method instead of "dispatch". This could potentially cause issues if the "entries" method is not defined for the object, or if it has a different behavior
