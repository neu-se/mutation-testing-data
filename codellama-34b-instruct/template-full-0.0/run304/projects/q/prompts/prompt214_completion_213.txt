  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the operand, and "object" is a possible return value for many types of objects, including promises. However, it would not be a reliable way to determine if a value is a promise, as it would also return "object" for other types of objects, such as arrays and functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if a value is an instance of a particular class or prototype. It would be a reliable way to determine if a value is a promise, as it would only return true if the value is an instance of the Promise class or a subclass of it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that is typically used to chain promises together. If a value has a `then` method
