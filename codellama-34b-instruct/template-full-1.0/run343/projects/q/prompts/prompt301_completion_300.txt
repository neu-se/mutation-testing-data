  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer be a list of two items, but a reference to the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
that
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer be a list of two items, but a reference to a different object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the elements in the list would be reversed.

DONE.
