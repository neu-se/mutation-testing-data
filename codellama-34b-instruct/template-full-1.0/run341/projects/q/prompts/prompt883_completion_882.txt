  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` passes a rejected promise to the callback, whereas `deferred.resolve` passes a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` passes a notification value to the callback, whereas `deferred.reject` passes an error value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will cause a runtime error when invoked, whereas `deferred.reject` is a function that is expected to be called with an error value.

DONE.
