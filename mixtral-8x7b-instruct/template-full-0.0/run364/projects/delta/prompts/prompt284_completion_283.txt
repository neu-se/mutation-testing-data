 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the newline character from Unix-style (LF) to Windows-style (CRLF).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the newline character entirely, causing lines to be concatenated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it escapes the newline character, causing it to be treated as a literal backslash followed by the letter 'n' instead of a newline.

DONE.
