  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key + '-' + this._data.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `JSON.stringify` to stringify the object `{key, val: this._data.get(key)}`, which would result in a JSON string with quotes around the key and value. However, the modified code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate the key and value, which would result in a string without quotes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value => JSON.stringify({key: value, val: this._data.get(value)})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `JSON.stringify` to stringify the object `{key, val: this._data.get(key)}`, which would result in a JSON string with quotes around the key and value. However, the modified code fragment uses an arrow function to create an object with the key and value, and then calls `JSON.stringify` on that object. This would result in a
