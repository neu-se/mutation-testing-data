  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` is a trigonometric function that takes an angle in radians and returns the sine of that angle, whereas `cos` is a trigonometric function that takes an angle in radians and returns the cosine of that angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is a trigonometric function that takes an angle in radians and returns the tangent of that angle, whereas `cos` is a trigonometric function that takes an angle in radians and returns the cosine of that angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is a trigonometric function that takes an angle in radians and returns the arccosine of that angle, whereas `cos` is a trigonometric function that takes an angle in radians and returns the cosine of that angle.
