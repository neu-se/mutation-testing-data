Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `data` would cause the callback to receive a `null` value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the consuming code that expects actual data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `data` would mean that the callback receives no value, which could lead to errors or incorrect assumptions in the logic that processes the returned data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because modifying `data` by adding `1` would change its value, which could lead to incorrect processing or logic errors in the subsequent handling of the data, especially if `data` is expected to be a specific type or value.

DONE.
