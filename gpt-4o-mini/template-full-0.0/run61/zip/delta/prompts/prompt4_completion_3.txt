Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to use the attributes from `a` instead of `b`, potentially omitting attributes that are only present in `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the attributes with `null`, leading to a loss of all attribute data and returning `null` instead of a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of `a` instead of deep cloning `b`, which could lead to unintended mutations if `a` contains nested objects.

DONE.
