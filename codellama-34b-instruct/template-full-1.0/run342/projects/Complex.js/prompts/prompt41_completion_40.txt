  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because 'logs' (logarithms) are different when the base is 10 instead of the natural base.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because the exponential function is different than the natural logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log2
```
This would result in different behavior because logarithms with base 2 are different from those with the base 10.

DONE.
