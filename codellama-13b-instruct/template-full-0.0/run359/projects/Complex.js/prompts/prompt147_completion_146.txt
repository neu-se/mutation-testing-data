  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the base is infinite, while the buggy code fragment checks if the exponent is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the base is zero, while the buggy code fragment checks if the exponent is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the base is NaN, while the buggy code fragment checks if the exponent is NaN.

DONE.
