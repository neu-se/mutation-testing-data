 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `cb` function would be a number instead of `null`. This could potentially cause issues if the code downstream expects a `null` value and behaves differently based on that.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `cb` function would be a boolean instead of `null`. This could potentially cause issues if the code downstream expects a `null` value and behaves differently based on that.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `cb` function would be a string instead of `null`. This could potentially cause issues if the code downstream expects a `null` value and behaves differently based on that.

DONE.
