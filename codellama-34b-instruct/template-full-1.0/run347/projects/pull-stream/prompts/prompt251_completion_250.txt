  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function expects a truthy value as the first argument, but `null` is falsy. This could cause the `read` function to prematurely end the stream, potentially resulting in data loss or inconsistencies.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function expects a truthy value as the first argument, but `undefined` is falsy. This could cause the `read` function to prematurely end the stream, potentially resulting in data loss or inconsistencies.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function expects a truthy value as the first argument, but `{}` is an empty object, which is falsy. This could cause the `read` function to prematurely end the stream, potentially resulting in data loss or inconsistencies.
