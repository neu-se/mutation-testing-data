  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a snapshot of the promise's current state, which would include the rejection reason and the stack trace at the time of rejection. By checking for the "rejected" state, the code would be checking for a specific type of rejection, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a snapshot of the promise's current state, which would include the rejection reason and the stack trace at the time of rejection. By checking for the "pending" state, the code would be checking for a specific type of rejection, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
