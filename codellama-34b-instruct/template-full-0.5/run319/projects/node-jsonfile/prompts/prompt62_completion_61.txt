  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.slice(1)` would return a substring of `content` starting from the second character, whereas `content` would return the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toLowerCase()` would return a lowercase version of `content`, whereas `content` would return the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.split('').reverse().join('')` would return the reversed version of `content`, whereas `content` would return the original string.

DONE.
