  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fin` method would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fin` method would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fin` method would be called with `0` as the first argument, which would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
