  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejected promise would be treated as a resolved promise, and the rejection reason would be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q()
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty promise would be created and returned, regardless of the original promise's state or value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in an error, as null is not a valid promise or value to return.

DONE.
