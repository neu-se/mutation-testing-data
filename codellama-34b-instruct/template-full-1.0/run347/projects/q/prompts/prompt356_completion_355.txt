  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.exception` would replace the rejection exception, causing the promise to resolve instead of reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise instead of returning a rejected promise.

DONE.
