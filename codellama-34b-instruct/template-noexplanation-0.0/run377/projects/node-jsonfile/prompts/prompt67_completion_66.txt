  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This will cause the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of `\n` with a space character, which is different from the original behavior of replacing them with the value of the `EOL` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This will cause the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of `\n` with an empty string, which is different from the original behavior of replacing them with the value of the `EOL` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This will cause the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of `\n` with the literal string `\n`, which is different from the original behavior of replacing them with the value of the `EOL` variable.

DONE.
