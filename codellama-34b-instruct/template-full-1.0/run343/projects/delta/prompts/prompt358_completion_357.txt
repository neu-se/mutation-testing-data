  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority = !priority;
```
This would result in different behavior because `priority` would be inverted, which would cause the `transformPosition` method to always skip the specified `index`, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because `priority` would always be set to `true`, which would cause the `transformPosition` method to always prefer the `this` Delta's operations over the `other` Delta's operations, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because `priority` would always be set to `false`, which would cause the `transformPosition` method to always prefer the `other` Delta's operations over the `this` Delta's operations, leading to incorrect behavior.

DONE.
