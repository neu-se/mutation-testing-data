  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].match(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns an array of matches, whereas `test` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether the pattern matches the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.match(rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns an array of matches, whereas `test` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether the pattern matches the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].search(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method that returns the index of the first match, whereas `test` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether the pattern matches the string.

DONE.
