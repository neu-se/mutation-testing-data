  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if there are no more operations to iterate over, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue if the length of the next operation is greater than zero, even if there are no more operations to iterate over.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue if the type of the next operation is not 'insert', even if there are no more operations to iterate over.

DONE.
