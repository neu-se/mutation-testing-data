  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that schedules the `flush` function to be called asynchronously, while `requestPortTick` is a function that posts a message to the `MessageChannel` and schedules the `flush` function to be called asynchronously when the message is received. Using `requestTick` instead of `requestPortTick` would cause the `flush` function to be called more frequently, which could lead to different behavior in the program.
