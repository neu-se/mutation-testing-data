  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNegativeInfinity']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinity` and `isNegativeInfinity` are two distinct properties, and the code would produce a different result when the value of `z` is negative infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check the value of `z` instead of `this`, which could produce a different result if `z` is infinite but `this` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would invert the result of `isInfinite`, which could produce a different result if `this` is not infinite but `z` is.

DONE.
