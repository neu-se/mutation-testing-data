  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "set" operator to set a property on an object, while the buggy code fragment uses the "set" operator to set a property on an object and then returns the object. This would cause the test to fail if the test is expecting the original behavior.
