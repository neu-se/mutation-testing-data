  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a value isNaN, whereas `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isSafeInteger(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isSafeInteger()` checks if a value is a safe integer, whereas `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `> 0` checks if a value is greater than 0, whereas `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is finite.

DONE.
