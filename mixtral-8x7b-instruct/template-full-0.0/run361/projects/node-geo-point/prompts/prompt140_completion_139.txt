 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the longitude value, which can lead to incorrect calculations or representations of the geographical point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), which can lead to unpredictable results in the `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.altitude || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `altitude` property instead of `longitude`, or defaults to 0 if `altitude` is not defined. This can lead to incorrect calculations or representations of the geographical point, especially if the code relies on the assumption that `longitude` is being used.

DONE.
