  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the event would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, as the event name is the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the event would not be executed.

DONE.
