  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = s.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the previous `read` statement with a new one that refers to the `sink` property of `s`, rather than the `source` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = s - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the previous `read` statement with a new one that subtracts 1 from the initial `read` value, rather than incrementing it by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the previous `read` statement with a new one that sets the `read` variable to `null`, rather than updating it with the value of the `source` property of `s`.

DONE.
