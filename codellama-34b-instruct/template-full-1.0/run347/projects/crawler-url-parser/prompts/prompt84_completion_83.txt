  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html().trim
```
This would result in different behavior because the `html()` method returns the HTML content of the element, while the `text()` method returns the text content of the element, which may not be the same if the element contains HTML markup.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr("href").trim
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr()` method returns the value of the specified attribute of the element, while the `href` attribute is the URL of the link, and it may not be the same as the text content of the link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).contents().text().trim
```
This would result in different behavior because the `contents()` method returns the children of the element, and their text content may be different from the text content of the element itself.

DONE.
