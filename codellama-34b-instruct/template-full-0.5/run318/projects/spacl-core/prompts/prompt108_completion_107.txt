  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `matches` method would return `false` even if the policy matches the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `matches` method would return `false` even if the policy matches the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"different_context"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would use a different context than the original code, which could result in a different result.

DONE.
