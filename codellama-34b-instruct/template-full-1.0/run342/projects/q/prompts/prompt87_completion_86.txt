  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(f, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing the elements of the array `f`, instead of a function reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce.call(f, function(a, b) { return a + b; }, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of all the elements in the array `f`, instead of a function reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map.call(f, function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing the elements of the array `f`, but with each element multiplied by 2, instead of a function reference.

DONE.
