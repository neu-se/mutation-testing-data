 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would receive an immediately resolved promise instead of the original promise, potentially causing the `onRejected` handler to not be called if the original promise was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise as its first argument, and `null` is not a promise. This would cause the `onRejected` handler to be called immediately with a `TypeError` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
