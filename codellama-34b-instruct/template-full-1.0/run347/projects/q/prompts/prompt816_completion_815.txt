  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).none
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a method that handles the resolution of a promise, while `none` is a method that handles the rejection of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(undefined, rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` does not have a rejection handler, while `then` does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).spread(fulfilled, rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` does not have a spread method, while `spread` is a method that passes an array of arguments to a fulfillment or rejection handler.

DONE.
