Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat URLs with the same number of path segments as being at a sublevel, which is not the intended logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider URLs with more than one additional path segment as being at a sublevel, potentially missing valid sublevel URLs that differ by just one segment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == -1 || part_count_diff == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow both uplevel and same-level URLs to be treated as sublevel, leading to incorrect categorization of the URL types.

DONE.
