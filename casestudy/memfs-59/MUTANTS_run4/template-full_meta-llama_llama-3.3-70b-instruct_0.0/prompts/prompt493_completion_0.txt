Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.isFile() && (flagsNum === FLAGS.r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is a file and the flags are set to read-only, which is the opposite of the original condition that checks if the node is a directory and the flags are not set to read-only.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!node.isFile() && (flagsNum !== FLAGS.w)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is not a file and the flags are not set to write-only, which is a different condition than the original one that checks if the node is a directory and the flags are not set to read-only.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.isDirectory() || (flagsNum & FLAGS.w)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is a directory or if the flags have the write bit set, which is a different condition than the original one that checks if the node is a directory and the flags are not set to read-only.

DONE.
