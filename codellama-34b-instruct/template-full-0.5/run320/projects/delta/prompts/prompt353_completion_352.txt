  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would cause the method to not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to the `chop` method, while this new code fragment passes the argument `1`, which would cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop(inverted.length());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to the `chop` method, while this new code fragment passes the argument `inverted.length()`, which would cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
