  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `newValue` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `newValue` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is the "undefined" operator.

DONE.
