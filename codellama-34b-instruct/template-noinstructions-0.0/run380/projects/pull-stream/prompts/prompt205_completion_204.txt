  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would pass the `end` signal to the callback, while `null` would pass `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would pass the `end` signal to the callback, while `undefined` would pass `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"end"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would pass the `end` signal to the callback, while `"end"` would pass the string `"end"` instead.

DONE.
