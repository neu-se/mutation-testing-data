  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `when` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved or rejected based on the input promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `when` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved or rejected based on the input promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `when.then` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved or rejected based on the input promise, whereas `when` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved or rejected based on the input promise.

DONE.
