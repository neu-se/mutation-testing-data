  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promises).allSettled(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` method is not defined in the `Q` object, and the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promises).allSettled(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` method is not defined in the `Q` object, and the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.
