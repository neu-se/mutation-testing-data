  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index of the promise is not equal to -1, while this replacement checks if the index is equal to -1. This would cause the code to behave differently when the promise is not found in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index of the promise is not equal to -1, while this replacement checks if the index is less than -1. This would cause the code to behave differently when the promise is not found in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index of the promise is not equal to -1, while this replacement checks if the index is greater than -1. This would cause the code to behave differently when the promise is not found in the array.
