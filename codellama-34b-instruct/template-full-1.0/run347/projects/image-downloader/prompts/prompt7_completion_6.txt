  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !path.extname(options.dest);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `dest` property of `options` is a valid image file extension, while this code fragment checks if the `dest` property is an invalid image file extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !path.extname(options.dest) || !path.isAbsolute(options.dest);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `dest` property of `options` is a valid image file extension, while this code fragment checks if the `dest` property is an invalid image file extension or not an absolute path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return path.basename(options.dest).includes('.');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `dest` property of `options` is a valid image file extension, while this code fragment checks if the `dest`
