  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments, and `data` is not the same as `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with the same argument twice, which is not the same as the original behavior.

DONE.
