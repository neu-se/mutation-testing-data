  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would not remove any elements from the `unhandledReasons` array, as the `at` variable would be equal to -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove one element from the `unhandledReasons` array, as the `at` variable would be equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove all elements from the `unhandledReasons` array, as the `at` variable would be equal to the length of the array.

DONE.
