  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the logic, returning a promise for an array of the corresponding values only when any of the promises gets rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index] !== promises[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce an infinite loop, constantly updating the value of `promises[index]` with itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index % 2 === 0 ? promises[index] : snapshot.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would alternate between using the value of `promises[index]` and `snapshot.value` for each promise, effectively creating a "checkerboard" pattern of values.

DONE.
