 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(this.verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over all keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the provided `verbs` array-like argument. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the order of iteration is different from the original `verbs` array-like.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `verbs` object, which would prevent the original `verbs` object from being modified. However, this change would not have the same effect as the original code, as it would not mark any verbs as allowed or denied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.verbs.filter(verb => verb !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out any undefined values from the `verbs` object, which
