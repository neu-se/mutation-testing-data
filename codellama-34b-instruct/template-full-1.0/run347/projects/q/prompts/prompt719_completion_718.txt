  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `"values"` method returns an array of the values in the object, whereas the `"keys"` method returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `"length"` method would return the length of the object, whereas the `"keys"` method returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unknownProperty"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `"unknownProperty"` method is not a valid method, whereas the `"keys"` method is a valid method that returns an array of the keys in the object.

DONE.
