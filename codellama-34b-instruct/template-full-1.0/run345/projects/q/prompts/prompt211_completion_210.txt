  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return true && callback.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `return true` would always return `true`, regardless of the outcome of the `callback.apply(this, arguments)` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, as it removes the `return true &&` part and keeps the `callback.apply(this, arguments)` part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !callback.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would invert the value returned by the `callback.apply(this, arguments)` call, so if the callback returned `true`, the new fragment would return `false`, and vice versa.

DONE.
