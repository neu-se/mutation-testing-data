  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```error.stack = null;```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be reset and would not be captured.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```error = null;```
This would result in different behavior because the error object would be set to null, making it impossible to capture the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```error.message = null;```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be set to null, making it impossible to capture the stack trace.

DONE.
