  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for non-strict inequality, meaning that it will return `true` if the operands are not equal, even if they are of different types. In the original code, the `===` operator is used, which checks for strict equality, meaning that it will only return `true` if the operands are equal and of the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, but it will return `true` if the operands are of different types. In the original code, the `===` operator is used, which checks for strict equality, meaning that it will only return `true` if the operands are equal and of the same type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === null
```
