 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw rejected; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejected reason would be wrapped in an error object, changing the type of the rejected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rejected promise instead of propagating the rejection, potentially causing different error handling logic to execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rejected promise using the ES6 Promise constructor instead of the Q promise implementation, potentially causing different error handling logic to execute.

DONE.
