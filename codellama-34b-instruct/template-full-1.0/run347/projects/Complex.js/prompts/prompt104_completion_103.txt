  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would be skipped, causing the parser to continue execution even if an invalid expression is encountered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += parseFloat(tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to include an additional token in the imaginary part of the complex number, causing the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] += parseFloat(tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to include an additional token in the real part of the complex number, causing the calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
