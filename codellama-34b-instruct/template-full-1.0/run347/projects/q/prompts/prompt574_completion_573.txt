  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator to return a new array containing the values of `this` and `arguments`, while this replacement would return a new array containing the values `1` and `2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator to return a new array containing the values of `this` and `arguments`, while this replacement would return a new array containing the values `undefined` and `arguments`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator to return a new array containing the values of `this` and `arguments`, while this replacement would return a new array containing the values `null` and `null`.

DONE.
