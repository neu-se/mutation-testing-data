  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` does not return a new array like `map` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(v => v)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` only returns the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce((acc, v) => acc.concat(v), [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a single value, while `map` returns an array.

DONE.
