  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('chilli', 'chillis')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a typo in the word "chillies," which would cause the test to fail if the typo were not corrected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('chilli', 'chillies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a typo in the word "chillies," which would cause the test to fail if the typo were not corrected.
