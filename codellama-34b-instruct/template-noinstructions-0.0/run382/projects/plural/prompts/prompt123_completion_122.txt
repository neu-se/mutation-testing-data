  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression is removed, causing the regular expression to become case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i

```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty
