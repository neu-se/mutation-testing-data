  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different set of words, such as "goose" instead of "geese".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'o'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different set of words, such as "dwarf" instead of "dwarfs".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'u'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different set of words, such as "person" instead of "people".

DONE.
