  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] != b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for inequality, rather than deep equality, which is the intended behavior of the `Object.keys` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the inverse of deep equality, which is not the intended behavior of the `Object.keys` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for deep inequality first, then check for strict equality, which is not the intended behavior of the `Object.keys` method.

DONE.
