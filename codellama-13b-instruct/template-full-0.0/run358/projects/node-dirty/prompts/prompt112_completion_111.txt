  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be more specific and provide more context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toString()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be more specific and provide more context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.length}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be more specific and provide more context.

DONE.
