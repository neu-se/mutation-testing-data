  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that concatenates two arrays, while `delete` is a method that removes an element from an array. The intention of the original code is to remove an element from the `inverted` array, but replacing it with `concat` would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array, while `delete` is a method that removes an element from an array. The intention of the original code is to remove an element from the `inverted` array, but replacing it with `push` would result in the array having one more element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a method that removes the last element of an array, while
