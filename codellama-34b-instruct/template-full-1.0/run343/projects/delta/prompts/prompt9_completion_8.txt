  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would be skipped and the `attributes` object would not be updated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false` and the `attributes` object would not be updated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setAttr(attrs, key, a[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attrs` object would be updated with a new key-value pair, regardless of whether the `a` object has a value for that key.

DONE.
