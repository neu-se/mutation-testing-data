  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).throw("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` method is called on the promise returned by `Q.async(makeGenerator)`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error message "error".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then(function () { return "error"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `Q.async(makeGenerator)`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value "error".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).catch(function () { return "error"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is called on the promise returned by `Q.async(makeGenerator)`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value "error" if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
