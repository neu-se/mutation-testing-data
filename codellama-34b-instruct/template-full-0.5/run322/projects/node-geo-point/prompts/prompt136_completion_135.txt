  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjustPrecision` method would always return a new `GeoPoint` with latitude and longitude set to 0, regardless of the original values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjustPrecision` method would subtract 1 from the `precision` parameter, which would result in a different number of decimal places being used for the latitude and longitude values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjustPrecision` method would round the `precision` parameter down to the nearest integer, which would result in a different number of decimal places being used for the latitude and longitude values.

DONE.
