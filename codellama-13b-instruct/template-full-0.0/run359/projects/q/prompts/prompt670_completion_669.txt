  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `void 0` to represent the `this` value, which is not necessary in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `void 0` to represent the `this` value, which is not necessary in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `void 0` to represent the `this` value, which is not necessary in this context.

DONE.
