  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is rejected, rather than fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise value is undefined, rather than checking if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().reason === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise reason is undefined, rather than checking if the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
