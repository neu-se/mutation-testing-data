  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of 10, whereas the original code uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of 2. This could result in different rounding behavior, depending on the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of 10, whereas the original code uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of 2. This could result in different rounding behavior, depending on the input values.
