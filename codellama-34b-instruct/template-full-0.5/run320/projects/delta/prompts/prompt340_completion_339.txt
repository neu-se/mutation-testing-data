  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice would include one more element than the original code, which could cause the `slice` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice would include three more elements than the original code, which could cause the `slice` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice would include four more elements than the original code, which could cause the `slice` method to return a different result.

DONE.
