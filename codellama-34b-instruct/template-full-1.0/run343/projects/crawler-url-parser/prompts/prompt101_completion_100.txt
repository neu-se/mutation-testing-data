  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.size` would return the number of elements in the map, instead of retrieving an element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.keys()` would return an iterator for the keys of the map, instead of retrieving an element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.get(currentUrl)` would retrieve the element from the map with the key `currentUrl`, instead of using the `url` property of the `currentUrl` object.

DONE.
