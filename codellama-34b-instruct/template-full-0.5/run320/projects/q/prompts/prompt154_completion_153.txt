  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR` constant is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + "From previous event:" + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR` constant is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + "From previous event:" + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR` constant is not defined.

DONE.
