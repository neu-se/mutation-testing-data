  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
multiply
```
This would result in different behavior because `multiply` is a function in some programming languages, but it is not a function in the context of the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
divide
```
This would result in different behavior because `divide` is a function in some programming languages, but it is not a function in the context of the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
modulus
```
This would result in different behavior because `modulus` is a function in some programming languages, but it is not a function in the context of the code snippet.

DONE.
