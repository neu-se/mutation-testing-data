 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the directory to the current one, instead of using the provided `src` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it enables gzip compression even when `compression` is set to `uncompressed`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
process.cwd(), src
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the target directory to the current working directory instead of the base path of the target file.

DONE.
