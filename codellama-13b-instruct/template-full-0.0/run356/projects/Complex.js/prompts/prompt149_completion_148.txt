  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than `||`, so the expression would be evaluated as `(this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) || (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']())`, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']() || this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would be evaluated as `(this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) || (this['isZero']() || z['isZero']())`, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']() && this['
