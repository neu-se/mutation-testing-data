  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would not match the same strings as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the same strings as the original code fragment, but the replacement string would be empty, resulting in the matched strings being removed from the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the same strings as the original code fragment, but the replacement string would be a single space, resulting in the matched strings being replaced with a single space in the input string.

DONE.
