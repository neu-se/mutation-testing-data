  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] = stackLine[2];
```
This would result in different behavior because the Array.prototype.push() method is not called, which would prevent the stackLine from being appended to the lines array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = lines.length - 1;
lines.splice(i, 1, stackLine);
```
This would result in different behavior because the Array.prototype.splice() method is called, which would replace the last element of the lines array with the stackLine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines.unshift(stackLine);
```
This would result in different behavior because the Array.prototype.unshift() method is called, which would prepend the stackLine to the lines array.

DONE.
