  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the placeholder element to the beginning of the `ops` array instead of the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index - 1, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the `newOp` element at the specified index instead of pushing it to the end of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `newOp` element to the end of the `ops` array instead of inserting it at the specified index.

DONE.
