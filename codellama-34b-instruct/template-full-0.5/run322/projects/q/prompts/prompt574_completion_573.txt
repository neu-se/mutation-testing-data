  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and therefore does not have a `promiseDispatch` method. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, and therefore does not have a `promiseDispatch` method. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is not an object, and therefore does not have a `promiseDispatch` method. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

DONE.
