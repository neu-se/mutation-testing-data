Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.removeTrailingSlash && urlObj.pathname !== '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to only remove the trailing slash when `removeTrailingSlash` is true and the pathname is not the root directory, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.pathname === '/' && urlObj.hash !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to only remove the trailing slash when the pathname is the root directory and the hash is not empty, which is unrelated to the original condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!options.removeTrailingSlash || urlObj.hash === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to remove the trailing slash when `removeTrailingSlash` is false or the hash is empty, which is different from the original condition that checks for `removeTrailingSlash` being true or the pathname being the root directory and the hash being empty.

DONE.
