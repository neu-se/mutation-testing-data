  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the path to uppercase, which could cause the code to look for the file in the wrong location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the path into an array of strings using `/` as the separator, and the `pop()` method would remove the last element of the array, which could cause the code to look for the file in the wrong location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace all occurrences of `/` in the path with an empty string, which could cause the code to look for the file in the wrong location.

DONE.
