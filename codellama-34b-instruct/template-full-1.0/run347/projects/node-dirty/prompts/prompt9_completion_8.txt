Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict';

const fs = require('fs');
const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;

class Dirty extends EventEmitter {
  constructor(path) {
    super();

    this.path = path;

    this._data = new Map();
    this._queue = new Map(); // Maps key to a list of callbacks.
    this._readStream = null;
    this._writeStream = null;
    this._waitForDrain = false;
    this._inFlightWrites = 0;

    this._load();
  }

  /**
   * set() stores a JSON object in the database at key
   * cb is fired when the data is persisted.
   * In memory, this is immediate - on disk, it will take some time.
   */
  set(key, val, cb) {
    if (val === undefined) {
