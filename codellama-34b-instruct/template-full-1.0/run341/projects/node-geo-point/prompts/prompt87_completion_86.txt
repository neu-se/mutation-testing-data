  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinδ = sinθ * cosδ + cosθ * cosδ * cosφ
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the formula for calculating δ, which is used in the calculation of sinφ2. The original formula is correct and should be used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinδ = sinθ * cosδ - cosθ * sinδ * cosφ
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the formula for calculating δ, which is used in the calculation of sinφ2. The original formula is correct and should be used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosδ = acos(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the formula for calculating δ, which is used in the calculation of sinφ2. The original formula is correct and should be used.

DONE.
