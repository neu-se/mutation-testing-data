  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `filter` is a method that returns the elements of an array that meet the condition specified in a callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` is a method that creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, while `filter` is a method that returns the elements of an array that meet the condition specified in a callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` is a method that applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value, while `filter` is a method that returns the elements of an array that meet the
