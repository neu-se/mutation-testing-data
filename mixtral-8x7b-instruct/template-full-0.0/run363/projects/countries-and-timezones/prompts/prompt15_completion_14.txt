 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null values, which might not have the same effect as checking for undefined in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'r' in tz
