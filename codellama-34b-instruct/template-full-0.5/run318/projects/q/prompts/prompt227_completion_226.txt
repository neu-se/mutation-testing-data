  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `messages` array is not empty, rather than checking if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first element of the `messages` array is not undefined, rather than checking if the array is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(messages) && messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `messages` variable is an array and if it is not empty, rather than checking if it is undefined.

DONE.
