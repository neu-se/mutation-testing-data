  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `throw` to propagate the rejection reason, while this new code fragment uses `throw` to throw an error unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `throw` to propagate the rejection reason, while this new code fragment returns the rejection reason as a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `throw` to propagate the rejection reason, while this new code fragment returns a rejected promise with the rejection reason.

DONE.
