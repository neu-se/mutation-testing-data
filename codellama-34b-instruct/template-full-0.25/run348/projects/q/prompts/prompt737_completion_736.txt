  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is always non-negative, so the condition would never be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is always non-negative, so the condition would never be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is always non-negative, so the condition would always be true.

DONE.
