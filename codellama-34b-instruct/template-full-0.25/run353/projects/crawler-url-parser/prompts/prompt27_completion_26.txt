  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.startsWith('http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to check if the string starts with a protocol, while this code uses the `startsWith()` method, which is more concise and easier to read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.indexOf('http://') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to check if the string starts with a protocol, while this code uses the `indexOf()` method, which checks if the string contains a specific substring at a specific position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.match(/^http:\/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to check if the string starts with a protocol, while this code uses the `match()` method, which checks if the string matches a specific regular expression.

DONE.
