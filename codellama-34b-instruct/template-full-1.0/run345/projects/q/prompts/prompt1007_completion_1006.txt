  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the argument passed to `array_slice` from `arguments` to `arguments, 0`, which would alter the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  array_length(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the argument passed to `array_slice` from `arguments` to the length of `arguments`, which would alter the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  array_range(arguments, 0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the argument passed to `array_slice` from `arguments` to a range of numbers from 0 to 10, which would alter the output of the function.

DONE.
