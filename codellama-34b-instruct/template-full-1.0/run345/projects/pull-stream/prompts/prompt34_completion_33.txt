  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice operator `[]` is using the second element instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + 'something'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is concatenating the first element with the string 'something', instead of returning the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let x = ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `let` keyword is declaring a new variable `x` instead of returning the first element.

DONE.
