  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `insert` property of `baseOp`, which is not the same as `baseOp` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `attributes` property of `baseOp`, which is not the same as `baseOp` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `baseOp` object, which is not the same as `baseOp` itself.

DONE.
