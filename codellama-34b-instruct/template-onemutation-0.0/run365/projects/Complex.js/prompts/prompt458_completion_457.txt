  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the number is not a number, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere. Using `isNaN` instead of `isInfinite` would cause the `toString` method to return "NaN" for any complex number that is not a number, rather than the expected string representation of the number.

DONE.
