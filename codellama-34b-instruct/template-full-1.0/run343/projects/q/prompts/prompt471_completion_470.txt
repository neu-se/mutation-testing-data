  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], unhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` parameter is not passed to `untrackRejection`, so the rejection would not be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], reportedUnhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would not be updated, so the rejection would still be considered unhandled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], unhandledReasons.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array would be modified, so the rejection would not be considered unhandled.

DONE.
