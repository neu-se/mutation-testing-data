  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._flush()` method is called immediately, whereas the original code fragment `this._flush` is only called when the `this._queue` is not empty. This could cause the `this._flush()` method to be called more frequently than intended, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._flush` method is not called immediately, but rather only when the `this._queue` is not empty. This could cause the `this._flush()` method to be called less frequently than intended, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(this._queue)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._flush()` method is called with the `this._queue` as an argument, whereas the original code fragment `this._flush` is called without any arguments. This
