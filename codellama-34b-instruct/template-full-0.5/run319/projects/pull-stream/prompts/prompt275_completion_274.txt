  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `stream`, which is an object, and `null` is a primitive value. The `stream` object has a `read` method that is called in the `nextChunk` function, but `null` does not have a `read` method, so the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `stream`, which is an object, and `undefined` is a primitive value. The `stream` object has a `read` method that is called in the `nextChunk` function, but `undefined` does not have a `read` method, so the code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `stream`, which is an object, and `{}` is an empty object. The `stream`
