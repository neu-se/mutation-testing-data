  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different error message, which may not be handled properly by the code that calls the `image` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is not a valid URL')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different error message, which may not be handled properly by the code that calls the `image` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is not a valid file path')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different error message, which may not be handled properly by the code that calls the `image` function.

DONE.
