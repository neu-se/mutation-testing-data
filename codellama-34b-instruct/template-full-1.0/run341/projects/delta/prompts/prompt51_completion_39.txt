  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys.length` would return the number of keys in the `Object.keys` object, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` would return an array of the values of the properties in the object, which would likely cause the code to fail because it is not compatible with the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString()` would return the string representation of the object, which would likely cause the code to fail because it is not compatible with the rest of the code.

DONE.
