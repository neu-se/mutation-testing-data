  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a function that queues a function to be executed after the current function has completed, whereas `setTimeout` queues a function to be executed after a specified delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` queues a function to be executed after a specified delay, whereas `setImmediate` queues a function to be executed after the current function has completed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` queues a function to be executed after a specified delay, whereas `setImmediate` queues a function to be executed after the current function has completed.

DONE.
