  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the elements in a different order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the elements from the specified start index to the end of the array, which would cause the `for` loop to iterate over a different set of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.filter(function(through) { return through.name === 'through'; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, which would cause the `for` loop to iterate over a different set of elements.

DONE.
