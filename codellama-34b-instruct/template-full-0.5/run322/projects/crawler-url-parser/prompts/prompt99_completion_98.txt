  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the object has the specified property as a direct property, whereas `has` checks if the object has the specified property, either as a direct property or inherited from its prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` returns the value associated with the specified key, whereas `has` returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` returns the number of elements in the map, whereas `has` returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property.

DONE.
