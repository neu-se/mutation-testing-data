  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used to negate the test function, which means that the `if` statement would be executed when the test function returns `false`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used to add 1 to the result of the test function, which means that the `if` statement would be executed when the test function returns a value that is greater than 1, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used to check if the test function returns the string 'test', which is different from the original behavior where the test function is called with no arguments.

DONE.
