  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, which would lead to unexpected results in the code that uses the resulting promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doNothing()
```
This would result in different behavior because `doNothing()` is a no-op function that would not affect the promise or its behavior, leading to unexpected results in the code that uses the resulting promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q.nfapply Promises rejection")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be thrown synchronously, which would lead to unexpected results in the code that uses the resulting promise.

DONE.
