Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument of the callback to `true`, which may not accurately represent the error state or the end of the stream, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the stream's termination.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'stream ended')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends a string message instead of the expected `null` for the error and does not provide the expected data, which could confuse the consumer of the stream about the state of the data being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the arguments in the callback, which could lead to incorrect handling of the callback parameters, as the first argument is typically reserved for an error, and the second for the data.

DONE.
