  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, {fragment: false})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fragment` option is set to `false`, which would remove the fragment from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, {protocol: 'https'})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` option is set to `'https'`, which would change the protocol of the URL to HTTPS.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, {hostname: 'example.com'})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hostname` option is set to `'example.com'`, which would change the hostname of the URL to `example.com`.

DONE.
