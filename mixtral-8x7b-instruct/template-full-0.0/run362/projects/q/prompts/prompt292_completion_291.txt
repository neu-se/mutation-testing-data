 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` function is replaced with `deferred.resolve`, which changes the behavior of the promise. The `notify` function is used to handle progress updates, while `resolve` is used to fulfill the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
