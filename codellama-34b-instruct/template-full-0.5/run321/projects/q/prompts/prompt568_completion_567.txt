  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the error to be caught and handled by the `errback` function, rather than being propagated to the next level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error, rather than being resolved with the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the error to be thrown again, rather than being caught and handled by the `errback` function.

DONE.
