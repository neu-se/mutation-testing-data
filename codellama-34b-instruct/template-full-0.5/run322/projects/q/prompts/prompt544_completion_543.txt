  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `StopIteration` is a property of the global object, while this code checks if `StopIteration` is equal to the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `StopIteration` is not a property of the global object, while this code checks if `StopIteration` is not equal to the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `StopIteration` is a property of the global object, while this code checks if `StopIteration` is an object.

DONE.
