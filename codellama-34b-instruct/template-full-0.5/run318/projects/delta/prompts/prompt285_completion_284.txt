  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be incremented by 1, which could affect the calculation of the `index` variable and the behavior of the `eachLine` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be multiplied by 2, which could affect the calculation of the `index` variable and the behavior of the `eachLine` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be divided by 2, which could affect the calculation of the `index` variable and the behavior of the `eachLine` method.

DONE.
