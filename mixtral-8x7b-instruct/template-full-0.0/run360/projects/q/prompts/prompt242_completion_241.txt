 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` check in the `valueOf` method would return `true` for `null`, causing the resolvedPromise to be replaced with `null`, potentially breaking the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with a new resolved promise, even if the input value is already a resolved promise, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always create a new unresolved promise, even if the input value is already a resolved promise, potentially causing the promise chain to hang or never resolve.

DONE.
