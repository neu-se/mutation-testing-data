  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the type is not 'Point', but this change also checks if the coordinates array has a length that is not 2. This would cause the code to throw an error if the point object has a type that is not 'Point' or if the coordinates array has a length that is not 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the type is not 'Point', but this change also checks if the coordinates array has a length that is not 2. This would cause the code to throw an error if the point object has a type that is not 'Point' and the coordinates array has a length that is not 2.
