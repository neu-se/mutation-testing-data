  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part is inverted, which would cause the resulting complex number to have a different real and imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional 1 is added to the imaginary part, which would cause the resulting complex number to have a different real and imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part is multiplied by 2, which would cause the resulting complex number to have a different real and imaginary part.

DONE.
