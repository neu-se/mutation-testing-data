  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `!cb` negates the value of `cb`, which is a function that should be called with the `end` and `data` arguments. Negating this function would cause it to never be called, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a function, and adding 1 to a function does not make sense. This would cause a runtime error, and the test would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return cb(end, data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function that calls `cb` with the `end` and `data` arguments, but does not use the `op` function. This would cause the function to behave differently than the original code, and the test would fail.

DONE.
