  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/^/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the "http://" protocol to the beginning of the URL, which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently by the browser or other software.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/\//g, '\\')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all forward slashes in the URL with backslashes, which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently by the browser or other software.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/^/, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the "https://" protocol to the beginning of the URL, which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently by the browser or other software.

DONE.
