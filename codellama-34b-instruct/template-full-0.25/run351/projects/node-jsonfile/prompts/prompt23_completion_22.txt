  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `content` variable as-is, while this replacement code fragment is converting the content to uppercase before passing it to `JSON.parse()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `content` variable as-is, while this replacement code fragment is slicing the content from the first character onwards before passing it to `JSON.parse()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `content` variable as-is, while this replacement code fragment is reversing the content before passing it to `JSON.parse()`.

DONE.
