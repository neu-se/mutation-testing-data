  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'' + dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` variable is a number, but the `+` operator will convert it to a string, resulting in a different output than the original `getOffsetStr` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` will add 1 to the `dstOffset` variable, resulting in a different output than the original `getOffsetStr` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` will multiply the `dstOffset` variable by 2, resulting in a different output than the original `getOffsetStr` function.

DONE.
