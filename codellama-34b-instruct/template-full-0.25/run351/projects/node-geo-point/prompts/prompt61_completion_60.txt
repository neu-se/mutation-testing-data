  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the destination point instead of the latitude of the starting point, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the starting point instead of the latitude, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the destination point instead of the latitude, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
