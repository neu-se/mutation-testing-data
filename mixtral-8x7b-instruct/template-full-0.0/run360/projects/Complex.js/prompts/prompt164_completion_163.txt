 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the conditions, which could lead to unexpected results if the `isZero` and `isInfinite` functions have side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isNaN']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `NaN` instead of `0`, which would cause the division to return `Complex.INFINITY` even when the divisor is not zero but `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']() || z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the dot notation instead of the bracket notation to access the `isInfinite` property of the `z` object. If the `z` object has a custom `toString` method that returns a
