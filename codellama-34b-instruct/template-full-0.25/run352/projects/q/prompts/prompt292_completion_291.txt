  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is called with a `null` argument, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is called with an `undefined` argument, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is called with a `0` argument, which would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
