  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, while `end` is a truthy value. If the `end` value is replaced with `null`, the `once` function will not be called, even if `end` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `end` is a truthy value. If the `end` value is replaced with `undefined`, the `once` function will not be called, even if `end` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a truthy value, while `end` is a falsy value. If the `end` value is replaced with `true`, the `once` function will be called, even if `end` is false.

DONE.
