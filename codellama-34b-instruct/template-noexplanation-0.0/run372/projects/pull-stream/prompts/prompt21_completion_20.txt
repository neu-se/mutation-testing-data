  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This code fragment is a direct replacement for the original `pull` function call, but it includes an additional argument `ref[3]`. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently than expected, as the additional argument may be used in a way that was not intended by the original author.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous option, but it includes an additional argument `ref[4]`. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently than expected, as the additional argument may be used in a way that was not intended by the original author.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4], ref[5])
```
