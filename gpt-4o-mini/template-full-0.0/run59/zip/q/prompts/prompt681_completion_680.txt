Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `void 0` changes the context in which the function is called, potentially leading to different behavior in how `this` is handled within the invoked function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the index in `array_slice(arguments, 1)` to `array_slice(arguments, 0)` means that all arguments are passed instead of skipping the first one, which could lead to unexpected results if the function expects a specific number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty array instead of the sliced arguments means that the invoked function will receive no arguments at all, which could lead to errors or different outcomes depending on how the function is designed to handle its parameters.

DONE.
