  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset > index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the offset is less than the index, while this new code fragment checks if the offset is greater than the index. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios, such as when the offset is greater than the index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset !== index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the offset is less than or equal to the index, while this new code fragment checks if the offset is not equal to the index. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios, such as when the offset is equal to the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset + length > index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
