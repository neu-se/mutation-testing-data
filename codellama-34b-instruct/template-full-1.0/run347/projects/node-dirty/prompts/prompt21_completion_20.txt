  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cbs.push(cb) === 3) cbs.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the length of the `cbs` array, which is used to store the callbacks for a given key. The original code did not have this condition, so it would always push the callbacks onto the array, regardless of the length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cbs.push(cb) > 3) cbs.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the length of the `cbs` array in a different way than the original code. The original code did not have this condition, so it would always push the callbacks onto the array, regardless of the length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cbs.length < 3) cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the length of the `c
