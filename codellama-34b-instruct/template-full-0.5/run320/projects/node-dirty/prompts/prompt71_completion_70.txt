  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a load event with the number of keys in the database, while the new code would emit a load event with the number 1, regardless of the number of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a load event with the number of keys in the database, while the new code would emit a load event with the Dirty object itself, which would cause the event handler to receive a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a load event with the number of keys in the database, while the new code would emit a load event with null, which would cause the event handler to receive a null argument.

DONE.
