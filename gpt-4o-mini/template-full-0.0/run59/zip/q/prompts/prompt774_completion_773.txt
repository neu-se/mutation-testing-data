Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the promises array instead of the array itself, leading to incorrect handling of the promises and potentially causing the function to reject immediately if the length is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` instead of the promises array, causing the function to fail when trying to process the promises, as `null` does not have the methods expected by the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` instead of the promises array, which would lead to errors when the code attempts to access properties or methods on `undefined`, resulting in a runtime error.

DONE.
