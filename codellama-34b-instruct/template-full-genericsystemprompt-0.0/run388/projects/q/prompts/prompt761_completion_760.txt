  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, which would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise for an array of promises that is different from the original array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the original array with the given arguments, which would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise for an array of promises that is different from the original array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function() { return true; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array that contains only the elements that pass the test implemented by the given function, which would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise for an array of promises that is different from
