  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a null value, whereas the original code would call it with the abort error or data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(err, function(abortErr) {
    // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
    cb(err)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the abort error, whereas the original code would only call it with the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function(data) {
    cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the data, whereas the original code would call it with the abort error or data.

DONE.
