  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be null, causing the `for` loop to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `values()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = "https://example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be a string, causing the `for` loop to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `values()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = URL.parse(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be a `URL` object, causing the `for` loop to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `values()` method.

DONE.
