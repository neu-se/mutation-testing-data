 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately invoke the `hasNext` method and pass `start - index` as an argument, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment uses the method without parentheses, which is a reference to the function itself, allowing it to be passed as an argument to the `peek` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.hasNext && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `hasNext` method exists and then calls it with `start - index` as an argument. This is not the intended behavior, as it would always invoke the method, even when it's not necessary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next.bind(iter)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function bound to the `iter` object that invokes the `next
