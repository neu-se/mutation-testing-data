  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses addition, while this replacement uses subtraction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses addition, while this replacement uses subtraction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses addition, while this replacement uses addition with a different constant.

DONE.
