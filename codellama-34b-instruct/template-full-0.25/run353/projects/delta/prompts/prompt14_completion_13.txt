  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of keys in the `attributes` object, rather than the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of the values in the `attributes` object, rather than the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of key-value pairs in the `attributes` object, rather than the object itself.

DONE.
