  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp &&
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `&&` changes the behavior of the short-circuit evaluation operator. The original code would return `nextOp` if it is truthy, but with the added `&&`, it would only return `nextOp` if `nextOp` is truthy and `this.hasNext()` is also truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp +
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `+` changes the type of the expression from a logical AND to an arithmetic addition. The original code would return `nextOp` if it is truthy, but with the added `+`, it would return the sum of `nextOp` and `this.hasNext()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp -
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `-` changes the type of the expression from a logical AND to an arithmetic subtraction. The original
