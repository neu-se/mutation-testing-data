  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}.*/`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.*` at the end of the regex would match any character zero or more times, including the `/` character, which would cause the regex to match more than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}{1,}/`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{1,}` at the end of the regex would match the previous character one or more times, which would cause the regex to match more than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}{1}/`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{1}` at the end of the regex would match the previous character exactly once, which would cause the regex to
