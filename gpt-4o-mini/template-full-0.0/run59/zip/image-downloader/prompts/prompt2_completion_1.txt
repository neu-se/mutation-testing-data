Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.resolve(new Error('The options.url is required'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with an error instead of rejecting it, which means that the calling code may not handle the error as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject('The options.url is required');
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with a string instead of an Error object, which may lead to improper error handling in the consuming code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise successfully without any error, which would allow the code to continue executing as if the URL was provided, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
