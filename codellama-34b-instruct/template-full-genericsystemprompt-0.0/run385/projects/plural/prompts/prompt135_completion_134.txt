  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while the modified code fragment converts the `word` variable to lowercase before using it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while the modified code fragment converts the `word` variable to uppercase before using it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while the modified code fragment reverses the order of the characters in the `word` variable before using it.

DONE.
