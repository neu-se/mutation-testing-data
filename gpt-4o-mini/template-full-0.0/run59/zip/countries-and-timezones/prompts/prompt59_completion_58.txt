Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id + '1')
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `id` by appending '1', which would likely cause the function to look for a non-existent country, resulting in an incorrect or undefined country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the `id` would lead to the `buildCountry` function potentially failing or returning an unexpected result, as it would not be able to find a valid country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, 'unknownCountry')
```
This would result in different behavior because using a hardcoded string like 'unknownCountry' would cause the function to attempt to retrieve a country that does not exist in the data, leading to an incorrect or empty country object.

DONE.
