 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd` might expect a different type of argument or no argument at all, and the `data` being passed in could cause unintended behavior or errors in the `onEnd` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data)
