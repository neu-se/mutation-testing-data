Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be the `targetPath` itself, rather than a modified version of it, potentially leading to incorrect file paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be the `currentPath` instead of the `targetPath`, effectively copying files to their original location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.join(targetPath, path.basename(file.name))
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be a joined path of `targetPath` and the base name of the `file.name`, potentially changing the directory structure of the copied files.

DONE.
