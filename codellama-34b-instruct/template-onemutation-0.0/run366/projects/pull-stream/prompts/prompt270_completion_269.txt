  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is an object, while the new code fragment checks if `stream` is a function. This change would cause the `nextStream` function to behave differently if `stream` is a function, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
