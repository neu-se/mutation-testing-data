  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with the given value, whereas `rejected` is a function that rejects the promise with the given exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `rejected` is a function that rejects the promise with the given exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` is a statement that returns the value from the function, whereas `rejected` is a function that rejects the promise with the given exception.

DONE.
