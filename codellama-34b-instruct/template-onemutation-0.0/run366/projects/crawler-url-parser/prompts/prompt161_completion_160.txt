  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part === pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `==` operator, which checks for equality after converting the operands to a common type, while the new code uses the `===` operator, which checks for equality without converting the operands. This means that the new code will only return "samelevel" if the operands are of the same type and have the same value, whereas the original code would return "samelevel" if the operands have the same value, regardless of their type.

DONE.
