 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'drain', () => this._close()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.close()` is being replaced with `this._close()`, which is likely not defined or has different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'data', () => this.close()
