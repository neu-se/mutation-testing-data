Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for a 'delete' operation instead of an 'insert' operation, which would alter the logic of how operations are processed in the composition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the comparison operator from `<=` to `>`, which could lead to skipping valid operations that should be included in the composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() === firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for equality instead of less than or equal to, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely and not process all relevant operations.

DONE.
