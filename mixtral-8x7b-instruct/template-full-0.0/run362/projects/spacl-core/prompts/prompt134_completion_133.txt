 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'verb' in rule.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string 'verb' exists as a property in the `verbs` object instead of checking if the `verb` variable exists as a property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.verbs.hasOwnProperty(verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `verbs` object has the `verb` property directly, but it won't check the prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(this.verbs).includes(verb)
