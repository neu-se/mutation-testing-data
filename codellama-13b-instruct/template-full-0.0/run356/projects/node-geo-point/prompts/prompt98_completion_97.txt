  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to x would cause the calculation to be off by 1 degree.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from x would cause the calculation to be off by 1 degree in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of x by 2 would cause the calculation to be off by 2 degrees.

DONE.
