  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an empty array, causing the `for` loop to be skipped and the `finalise` function to return an empty string, which would not match any paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array with a single element, which would cause the `for` loop to execute only once, and the `finalise` function to return a string that matches only the last segment of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array with an infinite number of elements, causing the `for` loop to execute indefinitely, and the `finalise` function to return a string that matches any path.

DONE.
