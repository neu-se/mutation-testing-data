  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the logic is reversed, making it a trait-based mutation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if linkurl_path starts with pageurl_path, making it a behavior-based mutant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.substring(0, pageurl_path.length) === pageurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the first pageurl_path.length characters of linkurl_path to pageurl_path, making it a fluent-interface-based mutant.

DONE.
