  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` would create a new promise that would be fulfilled with the return value of the callback function, which is undefined in this case. This would cause the `Q.done()` method to throw an error instead of calling the `onUnhandledError` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.catch()` would create a new promise that would be rejected with the error object, which would cause the `Q.done()` method to call the `onUnhandledError` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.finally()` would create a new promise that would be resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is undefined in this case. This would cause the `Q.done()`
