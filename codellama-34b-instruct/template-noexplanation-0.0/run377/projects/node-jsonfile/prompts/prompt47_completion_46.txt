  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.' + options.encoding
```
This change will cause the `fs.writeFileSync` method to write to a different file than the one specified in the `file` parameter, which may cause the test to fail if it is expecting to write to the original file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.' + options.encoding + '.' + Math.random()
```
This change will cause the `fs.writeFileSync` method to write to a different file than the one specified in the `file` parameter, and the random string added to the end of the file name will make it even more unlikely that the test will pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.' + options.encoding + '.' + Date.now()
```
This change will cause the `fs.writeFileSync` method to write to a different file than the one specified in the `file` parameter, and the current timestamp added to the end of the
