  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the "apply" method as a single array, instead of as separate arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the "apply" method starting from the second argument, instead of from the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the "apply" method starting from the third argument, instead of from the first argument.

DONE.
