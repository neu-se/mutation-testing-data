 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original expression uses `coshm1(b)` while the mutated expression uses `Math.cos(b)`, which would produce different results for non-zero `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original expression uses `coshm1(b)` while the mutated expression uses the `im` property of the current object, which would produce different results if the `im` property is not equal to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original expression uses `coshm1(b)` while the mutated expression uses `0`, which would produce different results for non-zero `b`.

DONE.
