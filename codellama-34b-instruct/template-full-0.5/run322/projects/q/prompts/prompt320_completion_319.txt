  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op](promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function `descriptor[op]` with the `promise` and `args` arguments, rather than applying the function to the `promise` and `args` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function `descriptor[op]` with the `args` argument, rather than the `promise` and `args` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op](promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function `descriptor[op]` with the `promise` argument, rather than the `promise` and `args` arguments.

DONE.
