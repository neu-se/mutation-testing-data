  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called with the correct number of arguments, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with a function that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with a function that returns a rejected promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
