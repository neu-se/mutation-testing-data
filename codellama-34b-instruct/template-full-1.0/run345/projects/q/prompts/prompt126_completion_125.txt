  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[prop]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access a property on the `object` object, rather than calling the `hasOwnProperty` method on `Object.prototype`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty(prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `object` has a property with the key `prop`, rather than checking if `object[prop]` exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `hasOwnProperty` method on `Object.prototype` with `object` as the context object and `prop` as the property name, rather than calling the `hasOwnProperty` method on `object` itself.

DONE.
