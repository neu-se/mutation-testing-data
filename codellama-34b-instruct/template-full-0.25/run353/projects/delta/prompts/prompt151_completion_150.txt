  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add the values of `firstOther.retain` and `firstLeft`, whereas the `-` operator would subtract `firstLeft` from `firstOther.retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain * firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the values of `firstOther.retain` and `firstLeft`, whereas the `-` operator would subtract `firstLeft` from `firstOther.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain / firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator would divide the values of `firstOther.retain` and `firstLeft`, whereas the `-` operator would subtract `firstLeft` from `firstOther.retain`.

DONE.
