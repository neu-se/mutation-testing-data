  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(0, path.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the path, which could potentially change the meaning of the path and the policy that is applied to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the path to uppercase, which could potentially change the meaning of the path and the policy that is applied to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path on the '/' character and return the first part of the path, which could potentially change the meaning of the path and the policy that is applied to it.

DONE.
