  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is only called when `err` is not `null`, whereas the original code fragment calls `cb` regardless of whether `err` is `null` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a `null` value as the second argument to the `read` function, whereas the original code fragment passes the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(err || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `err` value if it is not `null`, or `null` if `err` is `null`, whereas the original code fragment always returns `cb` without checking whether `err` is `null` or not.

DONE.
