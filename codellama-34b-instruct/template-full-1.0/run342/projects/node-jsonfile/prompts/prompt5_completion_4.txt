  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + options
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator is used instead of the comma operator, which would result in a different value being passed to the `universalify.fromCallback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file - options
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator is used instead of the comma operator, which would result in a different value being passed to the `universalify.fromCallback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file * options
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is used instead of the comma operator, which would result in a different value being passed to the `universalify.fromCallback` function.

DONE.
