Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array at the next index instead of the correct index, potentially leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the first element from the `unhandledRejections` array, regardless of which promise was actually being untracked, leading to incorrect state management.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array at the previous index, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect removal of a different promise.

DONE.
