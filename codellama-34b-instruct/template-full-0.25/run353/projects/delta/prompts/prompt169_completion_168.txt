  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to iterate over the `other` delta's ops instead of the `this` delta's ops, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to use the next op in the `this` delta's ops instead of the current op, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to use the next op in the `other` delta's ops instead of the current op, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
