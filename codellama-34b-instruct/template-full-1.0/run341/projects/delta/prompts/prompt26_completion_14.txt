  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
delete attributes
```

This would result in different behavior because `delete` is an operator that removes properties from an object, whereas `Object.keys` is a method that returns an array of a given object's property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
attributes = null
```

This would result in different behavior because assigning `null` to `attributes` would reset it to an empty object, whereas `Object.keys` would still return an array of property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
attributes = { ...null }
```

This would result in different behavior because the spread operator (`...`) would create a new object with the properties of `null` (i.e. an empty object), whereas `Object.keys` would still return an array of property names.

DONE.
