  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

By replacing `fulfilled` with `rejected`, the promise returned by `then` will always be rejected, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `function (value) { return value; }` is a function that simply returns its argument, while `fulfilled` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise. By replacing `fulfilled` with this function, the promise returned by `then` will always be fulfilled with the value of the original promise, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { throw new Error("test error"); }
```
This would
