  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt` function returns the square root of a number, whereas the `Math.pow` function returns the result of raising a number to a power. In the context of the code, this would cause the `ceil` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function returns the absolute value of a number, whereas the `Math.pow` function returns the result of raising a number to a power. In the context of the code, this would cause the `ceil` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor` function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number, whereas the `Math.pow` function returns the result of raising a number to a power. In the context of
