  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function would be called with `data` even if `end` is truthy, whereas the original code would only call `mapper` if `end` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function would be called with `data` only if `end` is truthy, whereas the original code would call `mapper` with `data` if `end` is falsy or if `data` is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data || end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function would be called with `data` only if `data` is truthy, whereas the original code would call `mapper` with `data` if `data` is null or undefined or if `end` is truthy.
