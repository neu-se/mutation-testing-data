  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(0), Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` returns a copy of the `promises` array, while `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.shift(), Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element from the `promises` array, while `Q.defer` creates a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.pop(), Q.delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element from the `promises` array, while `Q.delay` delays the resolution of a promise for a specified number of milliseconds.

DONE.
