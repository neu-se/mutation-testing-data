  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` expects a single argument, but `next(2)` would provide two arguments, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` returns an `Array` of `Op`s, but `next()[1]` would return the second element of that `Array`, rather than the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next().peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` returns an `Array` of `Op`s, and `peekLength` is a method of `OpIterator`, not an `Op`.

DONE.
