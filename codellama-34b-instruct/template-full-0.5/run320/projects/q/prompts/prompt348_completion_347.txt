  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return reject(exception);` is missing a semicolon at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return reject(exception);` is missing a semicolon at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return reject(exception);` is missing a semicolon at the end.

DONE.
