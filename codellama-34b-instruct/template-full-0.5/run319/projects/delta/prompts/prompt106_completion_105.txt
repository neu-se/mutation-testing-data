  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => {
  if (index % 2 === 0) {
    return op;
  } else {
    return null;
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `predicate` function to determine which operations to keep in the filtered array, while this modified code fragment uses a different function that only keeps every other operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => {
  if (op.insert) {
    return op;
  } else {
    return null;
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `predicate` function to determine which operations to keep in the filtered array, while this modified code fragment uses a different function that only keeps operations with an `insert` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => {
  if (op.attributes !=
