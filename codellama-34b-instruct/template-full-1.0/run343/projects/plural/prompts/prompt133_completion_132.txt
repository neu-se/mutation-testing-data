  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the second element of the rule array, regardless of whether the word matches the first element of the rule array or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.parseInt(rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to convert the first element of the rule array to an integer, regardless of whether it is a string or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String(rule[0]).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would uppercase the first element of the rule array, regardless of whether it is a string or not.

DONE.
