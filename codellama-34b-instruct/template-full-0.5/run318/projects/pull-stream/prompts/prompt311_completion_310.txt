  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `data` value, so if `data` is truthy, it will become falsy, and if `data` is falsy, it will become truthy. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to the opposite of what it would have with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the `data` value, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different result. For example, if `data` is 0, it would become 1, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to true when it should be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator multiplies `data` by 2, which could cause
