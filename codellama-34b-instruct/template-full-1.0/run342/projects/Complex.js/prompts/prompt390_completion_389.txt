  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign changes the sign of the
result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be off by one unit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be off by a factor of `a`.
