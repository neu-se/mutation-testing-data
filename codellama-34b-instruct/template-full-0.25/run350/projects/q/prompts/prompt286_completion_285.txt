  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is used to check if the `resolver` is a function, but without the `typeof` operator, the code would check if the `resolver` is equal to the string "function", which is not the same thing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is used to check if the `resolver` is a function, but without the `typeof` operator, the code would check if the `resolver` is equal to an anonymous function, which is not the same thing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is used to check if the `resolver` is a function, but without the `typeof` operator, the code would check if the `resolver` is equal to
