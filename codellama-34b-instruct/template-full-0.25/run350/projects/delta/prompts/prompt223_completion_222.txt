  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the delta to itself, rather than to the other delta. This would always result in an empty diff, regardless of the contents of the deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the delta to a non-existent third string. This would likely result in an error or undefined behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the delta to a list of individual characters, rather than to a string. This would likely result in a different diff, depending on the contents of the delta.

DONE.
