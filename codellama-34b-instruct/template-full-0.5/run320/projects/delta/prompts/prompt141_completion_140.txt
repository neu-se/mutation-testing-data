  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the delta, and subtracting 1 would cause the iteration to skip over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the delta, and adding 1 would cause the iteration to include an extra operation that was not intended to be included.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the delta, and using the `otherIter` object would cause the iteration to use the length of the next operation in the other delta, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
