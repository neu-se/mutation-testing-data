  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` was referring to the variable `a`, while this new fragment `a + b` would be referring to the sum of `a` and `b`. This would break the functionality of the code, as the `cos` function is expected to receive a single argument `a`, and passing `a + b` would result in incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` was referring to the variable `a`, while this new fragment `a - b` would be referring to the difference of `a` and `b`. This would break the functionality of the code, as the `sin` function is expected to receive a single argument `a`, and passing `a - b` would result in incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because
