  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `prev` is an object, and adding 1 to an object would result in a different object, which would cause the `reduce` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev.concat([1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `prev` is an object, and `concat` method would add an element to the end of the array, which would cause the `reduce` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prev` is an object, and `slice` method would return a new array with the first element removed, which would cause the `reduce` method to return a different value.

DONE.
