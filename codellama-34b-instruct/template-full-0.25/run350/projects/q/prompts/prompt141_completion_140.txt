  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, whereas the original code fragment uses the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array, whereas the original code fragment uses the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas the original code fragment uses the original array.

DONE.
