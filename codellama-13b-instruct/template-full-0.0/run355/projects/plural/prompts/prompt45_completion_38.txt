  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `unshift` method to add a new rule to the `rules` array, while the modified code fragment uses the `push` method to add a new rule to the end of the `rules` array. This could result in different behavior if the `rules` array is being used in a way that relies on the order of the rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `unshift` method to add a new rule to the `rules` array, while the modified code fragment uses the `push` method to add a new rule to the end of the `rules` array. This could result in different behavior if the `rules` array is
