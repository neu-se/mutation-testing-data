  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches words that end with "s" and "es", but this new code fragment would also match words that end with "s" and add an additional "s" to the end, resulting in incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches words that end with "s" and "es", but this new code fragment would also match words that end with "s" and add "ies" to the
