  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a value to be passed, and if `null` is passed, it would result in the promise being resolved with a value of `null`, which is different from the original behavior of rejecting the promise with the original exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a value to be passed, and if a string is passed, it would result in the promise being resolved with a value of `"error"`, which is different from the original behavior of rejecting the promise with the original exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a value to be passed, and if `undefined` is passed, it would result in the promise being resolved with a value of `undefined`, which is different from the original behavior of rejecting the promise with the
