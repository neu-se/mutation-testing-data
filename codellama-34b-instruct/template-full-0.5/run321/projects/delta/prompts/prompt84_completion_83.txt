  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = newOp.attributes || {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `||` operator to set `newOp.attributes` to an empty object if it is undefined, whereas the new code would set it to `{}` unconditionally, which could cause issues if `newOp.attributes` is expected to be `null` or `undefined` in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = Object.assign({}, newOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `||` operator to set `newOp.attributes` to an empty object if it is undefined, whereas the new code would create a new object using `Object.assign` and assign it to `newOp.attributes`, which could cause issues if `newOp.attributes` is expected to be a specific object instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
