 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a division by zero error if `this.latitude` is 0, while `deg2rad` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` returns the arcsine of a number, while `deg2rad` converts degrees to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` returns the arctangent of a number, while `deg2rad` converts degrees to radians.

DONE.
