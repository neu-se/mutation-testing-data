  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new exception object, which would be different from the original exception object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the original exception object, which would be different from the new exception object created by `newException`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw the original exception object, which would be different from the new exception object created by `newException`.

DONE.
