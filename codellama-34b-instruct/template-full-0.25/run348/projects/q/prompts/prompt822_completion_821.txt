  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method expects a promise as its argument, and passing `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method expects a promise as its argument, and passing `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method expects a promise as its argument, and passing `0` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
