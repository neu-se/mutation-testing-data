 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'head'
```
This would result in different behavior because it targets the 'head' element instead of the 'base' element, potentially affecting the behavior of the 'href' attribute extraction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('a').eq(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it targets the first 'a' element instead of iterating over all 'a' elements, which may lead to extracting only one URL instead of multiple URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).attr('data-href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it targets the 'data-href' attribute instead of the 'href' attribute, potentially affecting the extracted URLs if the 'data-href' attribute is not consistently used.

DONE.
