  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function if the stream has ended, while this code fragment always calls the callback function, regardless of whether the stream has ended or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the accumulated value as the second argument to the callback function, while this code fragment passes the accumulated value as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes two arguments to the callback function, while this code fragment passes three arguments. The third argument is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream has ended.

DONE.
