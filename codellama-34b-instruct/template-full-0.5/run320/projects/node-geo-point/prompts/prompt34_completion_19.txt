  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the result of `sin` will be different from the result of `cos` for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is a trigonometric function, and the result of `tan` will be different from the result of `cos` for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse of `cos`, and the result of `acos` will be different from the result of `cos` for the same input.

DONE.
