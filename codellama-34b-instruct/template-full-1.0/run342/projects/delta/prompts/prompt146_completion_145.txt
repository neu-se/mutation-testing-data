  Sure, here are my three answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(start - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by a different number of positions than `thisIter.next()`, which would cause the resulting Delta to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(end - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` iterator by a different number of positions than `thisIter.next()`, which would cause the resulting Delta to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<op>.retain = <op>.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `retain` property of the `op` object, which affects how the `ops` are combined in the `Delta`.

DONE.
