  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w + 'S'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the input word concatenated with the letter "S", regardless of the word's original case or whether it ends with a silent "e".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the input word with all letters in uppercase, regardless of whether the word should be capitalized or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty string, regardless of the input word.
