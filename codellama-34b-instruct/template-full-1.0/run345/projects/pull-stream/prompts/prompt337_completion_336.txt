  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a new object, whereas the original code would only return a new object if `field` was not already a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the product of `field` and `prop`, whereas the original code would only return the product if `field` was a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field[prop]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the property `prop` of `field`, whereas the original code would only return the value if `field` was a function.

DONE.
