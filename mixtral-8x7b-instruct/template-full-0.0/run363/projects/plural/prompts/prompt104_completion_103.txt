 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'a' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an 'a' to the end of the word, changing the expected plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character of the word, changing the expected plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the word to uppercase, changing the expected plural form.

DONE.
