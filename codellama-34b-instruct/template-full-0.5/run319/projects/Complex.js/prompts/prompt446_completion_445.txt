  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer or away from zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer or away from zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.trunc` rounds towards zero, whereas `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer or away from zero.

DONE.
