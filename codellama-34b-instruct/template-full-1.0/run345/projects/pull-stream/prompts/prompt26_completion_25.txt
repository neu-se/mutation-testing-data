  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull = read = ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `ref[0]` to both `pull` and `read`, whereas the original code only assigns `ref[0]` to `pull`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull = function (x, y) { return y; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a new function `pull` that takes two arguments and returns the second argument, whereas the original code uses the original `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull = function () { return arguments[0]; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a new function `pull` that takes no arguments and returns the first element of the `arguments` array, whereas the original code uses the original `pull` function.

DONE.
