Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks only for write permissions on the source directory instead of checking for both read and write permissions, which could lead to a situation where the source directory is writable but not readable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetFilePath, fs.constants.R_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks the permissions of the target file path instead of the source directory, which could allow the operation to proceed even if the source directory is not accessible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
await fs.promises.stat(src);
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the source directory instead of its permissions, which means that the code would not throw an error if the directory exists but lacks the necessary permissions to read it.

DONE.
