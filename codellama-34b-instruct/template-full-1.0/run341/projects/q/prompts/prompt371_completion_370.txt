  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` variable is not a valid argument for the `_progressed` function, and it would cause the function to throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `value` variable, which is used in the subsequent lines of code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_progressed` function to return `null` instead of the expected `value`.

DONE.
