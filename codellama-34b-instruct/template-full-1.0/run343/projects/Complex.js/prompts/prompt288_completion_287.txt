  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in negative sine values in the 'cos' function, which would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * pi
```
This would result in a constant factor in the 'cos' function, which would not affect the output and would not provide a useful test case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in a different value for the sine function, which could potentially reveal a bug in the test suite.

DONE.
