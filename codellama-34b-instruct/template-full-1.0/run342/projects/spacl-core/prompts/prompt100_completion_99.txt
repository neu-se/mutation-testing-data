  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the original path to always be lowercase, potentially causing issues with case-sensitive matching.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match the last segment of the path, instead of matching the entire path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.indexOf('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the path contains a slash, instead of matching the entire path.

DONE.
