  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return `'Null'` instead of the expected `'Object'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return `'Undefined'` instead of the expected `'Object'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call()` would return `'[object Array]'` when the argument is an empty array, instead of the expected `'[object Object]'`.

DONE.
