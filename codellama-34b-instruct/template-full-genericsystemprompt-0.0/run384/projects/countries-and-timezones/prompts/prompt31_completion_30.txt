  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be increased by 1 hour, which would change the resulting time string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be doubled, which would change the resulting time string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be decreased by 1 hour, which would change the resulting time string.

DONE.
