  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `firstOther.attributes` is `null`, while this code fragment checks if it is not `null`. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` or `false` differently, depending on the value of `firstOther.attributes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `firstOther.attributes` is `null`, while this code fragment checks if it is equal to `0`. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` or `false` differently, depending on the value of `firstOther.attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
