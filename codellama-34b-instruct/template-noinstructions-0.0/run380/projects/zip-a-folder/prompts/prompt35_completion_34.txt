  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on('error', reject)` event listener would be added to the `output` stream, rather than the `zipArchive` stream. If an error occurs while writing to the `output` stream, the `reject` function would be called, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('finish', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on('finish', resolve)` event listener would be added to the `output` stream, rather than the `zipArchive` stream. If the `output` stream finishes writing, the `resolve` function would be called, which would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('close', resolve);
```
This would result in
