  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is used in the calculation of the `sinh` and `cos` functions, while the `b` variable is used in the calculation of the `atanh` function. Mutating the `a` variable would change the resulting `Complex` object, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is expecting the `cosh` function to return a `Complex` object, but `null` is not a valid object. The code would likely throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `random` method returns a random number between 0.0 and 1.0, which would be used in the calculation of the `atanh` function. This would produce different results than the original code, which uses the `b`
