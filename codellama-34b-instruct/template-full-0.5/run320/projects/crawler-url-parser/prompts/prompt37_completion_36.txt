  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would not be called with the `true` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter, which could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would not be called with a value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter, which could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would not be called with a value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter, which could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
