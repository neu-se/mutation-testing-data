  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a different method than `dispatch`, and it would not trigger the same behavior in the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would extract the first argument from the `arguments` object, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would extract the first two arguments from the `arguments` object, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed
