  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the buffer, potentially changing the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the buffer to uppercase, potentially changing the error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.replace('db', 'file')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the string "db" with "file" in the buffer, potentially changing the error message.

DONE.
