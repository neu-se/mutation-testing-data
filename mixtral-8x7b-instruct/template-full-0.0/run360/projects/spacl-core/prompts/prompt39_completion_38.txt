 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the first capturing group will always match an empty string, even if there is no actual capture in the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.length
