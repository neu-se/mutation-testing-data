  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if the value is positive or negative infinity, while `isZero` checks if the value is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while `isZero` checks if the value is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` returns the real part of the complex number, while `isZero` checks if the value is zero.

DONE.
