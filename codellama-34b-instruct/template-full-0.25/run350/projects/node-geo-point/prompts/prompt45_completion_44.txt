  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r < 0 ? 0 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `r` is greater than 1 and returns 1 if it is, while this new code fragment checks if `r` is less than 0 and returns 0 if it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `r` is greater than 1 and returns 1 if it is, while this new code fragment always returns twice the value of `r`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `r` is greater than 1 and returns 1 if it is, while this new code fragment always returns the value of `r` plus 1.

DONE.
