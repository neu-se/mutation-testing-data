  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this replacement checks if `pageurl` is null. If `pageurl` is null, the replacement code would evaluate to true, while the original code would evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this replacement checks if `pageurl` has a length greater than 0. If `pageurl` is an empty string, the replacement code would evaluate to false, while the original code would evaluate to true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.indexOf("http") === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `pageurl` is a string, while this replacement checks if `pageurl` starts with "http". If `pageurl` starts
