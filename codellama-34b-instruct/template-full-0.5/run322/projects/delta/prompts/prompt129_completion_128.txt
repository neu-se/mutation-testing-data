  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an index out of bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one fewer time, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate two extra times, potentially leading to an index out of bounds error.

DONE.
