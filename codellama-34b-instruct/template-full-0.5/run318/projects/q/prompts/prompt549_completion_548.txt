  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.done` checks if the promise is resolved, while `result.fail` checks if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.done` checks if the promise is resolved, while `result.isRejected` checks if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!result.isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.done` checks if the promise is resolved, while `!result.isFulfilled` checks if the promise is not resolved (i.e., it is either pending or rejected).

DONE.
