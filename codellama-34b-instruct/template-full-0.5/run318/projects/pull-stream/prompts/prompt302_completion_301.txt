  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(false, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with a `false` value as the first argument, which would likely cause the function to behave differently than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with a `null` value as the first argument, which would likely cause the function to behave differently than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(undefined, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with an `undefined` value as the first argument, which would likely cause the function to behave differently than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
