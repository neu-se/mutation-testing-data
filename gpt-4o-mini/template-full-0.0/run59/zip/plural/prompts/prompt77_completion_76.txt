Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice', 'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly swaps the singular and plural forms, causing the function to return 'die' when 'dice' is passed, which is not the intended pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dog', 'dogs'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new rule for a completely unrelated word, which would not match the original intent of pluralizing 'die' to 'dice', leading to incorrect pluralization for the word 'dog'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'child', 'children'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the rule to handle a different irregular pluralization, which would not apply to 'die' and 'dice', thus failing to correctly pluralize 'die' as 'dice'.

DONE.
