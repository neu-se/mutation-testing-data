  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a method that removes and replaces elements in an array, whereas `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that merges two or more arrays into a new array, whereas `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a method that removes the last element from an array and returns it, whereas `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
