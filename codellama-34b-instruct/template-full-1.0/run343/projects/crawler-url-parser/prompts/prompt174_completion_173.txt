  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid placeholder"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "for testing purpose" is used as a placeholder comment, indicating that the code is part of a testing routine, but "invalid placeholder" is not a valid placeholder comment and may cause confusion or break the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"this is a buggy code fragment"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original comment, "for testing purpose", implies that the code is part of a testing routine, but "this is a buggy code fragment" indicates that the code is buggy and may not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"this code is intentionally broken"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original comment, "for testing purpose", implies that the code is part of a testing routine, but "this code is intentionally broken" indicates that the code is broken intentionally, which could cause confusion or break the code.
