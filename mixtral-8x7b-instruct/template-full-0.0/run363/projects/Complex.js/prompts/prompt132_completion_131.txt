 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the 're' property of `z` with Infinity, instead of checking if either `this` or `z` is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the subtraction result with Infinity, instead of checking if both `this` and `z` are Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0 === d ? 1 : d / c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent division by zero, but introduce a different bug where the divisor would be 1 when `d` is 0, instead of propagating the ZeroDivisionError.

DONE.
