  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function returns `true` if the given string is a glob pattern, and the original code fragment used `!isGlob(src)` to check if the string is not a glob pattern. Replacing `!isGlob(src)` with `isGlob(src)` would cause the code to enter the `if` block if the string is a glob pattern, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `!isGlob(src)` to check if the string is not a glob pattern, and `src.length === 0` would check if the string is empty. If the string is empty, the code would enter the `if` block, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.
