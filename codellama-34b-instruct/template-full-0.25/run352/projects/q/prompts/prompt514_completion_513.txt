  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that takes two arguments, but `null` is not a valid argument for either of them. In the original code, `defer` is called with a promise and a function as arguments, but `null` is not a promise and cannot be called as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid argument for either of the two parameters of the `defer` function. In the original code, `defer` is called with a promise and a function as arguments, but `undefined` is not a promise and cannot be called as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(Q.defer(), Q.defer())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a new promise, and calling `
