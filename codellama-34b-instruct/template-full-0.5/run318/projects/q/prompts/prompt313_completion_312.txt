  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a function that returns a new promise, whereas `this.then` is a method that returns the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is the promise that is being resolved or rejected, whereas `this.then` is a method that returns the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a new promise that is resolved with the value of the promise passed to it, whereas `this.then` is a method that returns the promise itself.

DONE.
