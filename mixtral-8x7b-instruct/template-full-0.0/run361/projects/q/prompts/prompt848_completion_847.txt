This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function is used to create a new deferred object, while `Promise.resolve()` creates a resolved promise. This change would cause the returned promise to always be resolved immediately, regardless of the state of the input promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Deferred not available'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error instead of creating a deferred object. This would cause any code that depends on the returned promise to fail with an error, rather than beh
