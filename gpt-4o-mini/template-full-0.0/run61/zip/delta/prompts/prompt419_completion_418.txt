Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat 'insert' operations as if they were 'delete' operations, potentially leading to incorrect index calculations when transforming positions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow all types except 'delete' to be processed, which could lead to incorrect handling of 'delete' operations and result in unexpected index transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over 'delete' operations entirely, which could cause the transformation logic to ignore necessary deletions and produce incorrect results in the final output.

DONE.
