  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule` variable is now `null`, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` instead of `true` or `false`. This would indicate that the test suite is not effective in detecting the presence of a `null` rule in the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule` variable is now `undefined`, which would cause the `query` method to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `query` method of the `undefined` rule. This would indicate that the test suite is not effective in detecting the presence of an `undefined` rule in the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = new Rule()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule` variable is now a new instance of the `Rule` class, which would cause the `query`
