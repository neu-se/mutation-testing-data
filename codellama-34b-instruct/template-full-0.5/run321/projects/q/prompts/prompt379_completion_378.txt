  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, but in this case, it would be called with `null` as the `this` value, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function with a given `this` value and arguments, but in this case, it would be called with `null` as the `this` value, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, but in this case, it would be called with `null` as the `this` value,
