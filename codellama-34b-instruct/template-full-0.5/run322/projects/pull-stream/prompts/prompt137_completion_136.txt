  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `end` is truthy, while this new fragment checks if it is not undefined. If `end` is a falsy value other than undefined (e.g. `null`, `false`, `0`), the original code would return `cb(null, generate())`, while this new fragment would return `cb(end)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `end` is truthy, while this new fragment checks if it is null. If `end` is a falsy value other than null (e.g. `false`, `0`), the original code would return `cb(null, generate())`, while this new fragment would return `cb(null)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof end !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the
