 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always accesses the same element instead of incrementing the index after accessing the element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1; undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the index but also returns `undefined`, which changes the return type of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the next element instead of the current element, causing an off-by-one error.

DONE.
