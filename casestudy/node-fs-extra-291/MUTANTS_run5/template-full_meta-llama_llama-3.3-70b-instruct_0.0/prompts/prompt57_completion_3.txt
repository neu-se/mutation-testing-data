Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would not have the '$' character escaped, potentially leading to incorrect path resolution if the target path contains '$' characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentPath + targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be a concatenation of the current path and the target path, rather than replacing the current path with the target path, potentially leading to incorrect file copying.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath.replace(/:/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would remove all ':' characters from the target path, potentially leading to incorrect path resolution on Windows systems where ':' is used to separate drive letters from the rest of the path.

DONE.
