Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first argument instead of all arguments except the first, potentially leading to incorrect resolution of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the value to resolve the promise, which is not the intended behavior of resolving with the actual value provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1 ? arguments[1] : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only resolve with the second argument if it exists, otherwise it would resolve with `undefined`, which may not be the expected value.

DONE.
