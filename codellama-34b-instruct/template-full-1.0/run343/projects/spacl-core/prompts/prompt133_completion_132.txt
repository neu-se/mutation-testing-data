  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `clone` would return a rule with a null `verbs` object, rather than a copy of the original rule's `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `clone` would return a rule with an empty `verbs` object, rather than a copy of the original rule's `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `clone` would return a rule with a reference to the original rule's `rules` object, rather than a copy of the `rules` object.

DONE.
