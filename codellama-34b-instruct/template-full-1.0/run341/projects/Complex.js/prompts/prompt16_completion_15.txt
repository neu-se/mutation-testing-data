  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to a different value, which would affect the overall result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + 2 * a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a multiplication by 2, which would change the overall result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + a + 2 * a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce an addition by 2, which would change the overall result of the function.

DONE.
