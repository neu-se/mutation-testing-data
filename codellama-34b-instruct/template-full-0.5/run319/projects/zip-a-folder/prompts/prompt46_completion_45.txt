  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `false` returns a boolean value that is always false, while the new code fragment `true` returns a boolean value that is always true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `false` returns a boolean value that is always false, while the new code fragment `null` returns a null value that is always null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `false` returns a boolean value that is always false, while the new code fragment `undefined` returns an undefined value that is always undefined.

DONE.
