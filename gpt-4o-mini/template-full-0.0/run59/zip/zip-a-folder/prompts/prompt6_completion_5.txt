Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(targetFilePath)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns only the last portion of the path (the file name), rather than the directory name, which could lead to incorrect file path handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(targetFilePath, 'dummy')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join` appends 'dummy' to the target file path, which would not represent the intended directory structure and could cause file access errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.resolve(targetFilePath)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.resolve` returns an absolute path based on the current working directory, which may not correspond to the intended directory of the source path, potentially leading to permission errors or incorrect file handling.

DONE.
