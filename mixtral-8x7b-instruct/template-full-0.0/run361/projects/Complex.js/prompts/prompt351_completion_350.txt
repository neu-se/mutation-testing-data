 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the result of the `cos` function, which can significantly change the outcome of the `cosh` calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has a different range of values than the `cos` function, which can lead to incorrect results in the `cosh` calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a) - Math.exp(-a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calculates the difference between `e^a` and `e^-a`, bypassing the division by 2, which can lead to incorrect results in the `cosh` calculation.

DONE.
