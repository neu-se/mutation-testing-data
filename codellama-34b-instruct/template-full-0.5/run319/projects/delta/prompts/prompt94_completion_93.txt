  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = arg;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `newOp` object would be overwritten with the value of `arg`, potentially changing the behavior of the `insert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `newOp` object would be set to `null`, potentially causing errors in the `insert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 'foo';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `newOp` object would be set to the string `'foo'`, potentially causing errors in the `insert` method.

DONE.
