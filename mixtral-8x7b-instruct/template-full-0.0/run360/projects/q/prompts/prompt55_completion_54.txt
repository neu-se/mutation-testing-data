 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"[object Process]".slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the `slice` method from the string, instead of checking if the `process` object exists and using its `nextTick` method if it does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return this }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would break the `call` function, which is used to call the `nextTick` function with the correct `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call the `nextTick` function, since it expects a function as its first argument.

DONE.
