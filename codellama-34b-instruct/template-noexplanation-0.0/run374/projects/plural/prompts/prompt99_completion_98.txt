  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/
```
This change will cause the regular expression to match the letter "b" instead of "a", which may result in different behavior in the code that uses this regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-z]/
```
This change will cause the regular expression to match any lowercase letter instead of just "a", which may result in different behavior in the code that uses this regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-zA-Z]/
```
This change will cause the regular expression to match any letter (lowercase or uppercase) instead of just "a", which may result in different behavior in the code that uses this regular expression.

DONE.
