  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks if the given value is NaN, whereas `isZero()` checks if the given value is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the negation operator, so `!z['isZero']` would evaluate to `true` if `z` is not zero, and `false` if `z` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` is the imaginary part of the complex number, and `===` checks for strict equality. So `z['im'] === 0` would evaluate to `true` if `z['im']` is equal to 0, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
