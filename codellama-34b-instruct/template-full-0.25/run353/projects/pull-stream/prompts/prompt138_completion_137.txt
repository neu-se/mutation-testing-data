  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if `end` is truthy, while this modified code fragment calls it regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of `generate()` directly, while this modified code fragment returns the result of `generate() + 1`, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate() * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of `generate()` directly, while this modified code fragment returns the result of `generate() * 2`, which is a different value.

DONE.
