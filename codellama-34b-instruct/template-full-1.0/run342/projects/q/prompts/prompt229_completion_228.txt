  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0].toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the first argument to lowercase, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the case of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[1] + args[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the second and third arguments, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the specific arguments passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all but the first element of the original arguments array, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the presence or absence of specific arguments.

DONE.
