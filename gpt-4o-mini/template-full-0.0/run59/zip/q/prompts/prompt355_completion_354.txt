Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"An error occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting with the actual new exception, it would reject with a string message, losing the context of the original error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because rejecting with `null` would not provide any information about the error that occurred, potentially leading to confusion when handling the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject with only the message of the new exception instead of the entire exception object, which may not include the stack trace or other useful debugging information.

DONE.
