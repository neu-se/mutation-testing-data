  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a different object than `this`, and `Q.nfbind` would be used instead of `this.nfbind`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.prototype` is a different object than `this`, and `Promise.prototype.nfbind` would be used instead of `this.nfbind`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` is a different object than `this`, and `defer().nfbind` would be used instead of `this.nfbind`.

DONE.
