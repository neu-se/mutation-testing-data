  Mutation testing helps to identify weaknesses in a test suite by intentionally introducing bugs into the code and then verifying that the tests catch them. This exercise involves applying mutation testing to the given code to identify potential weaknesses in the test suite.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.tail
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.tail` is a different property than `ends.promise.get`. The `get` method is used to retrieve the resolved value of the promise, while the `tail` property is used to access the tail of the promise chain. Replacing `ends.promise.get` with `ends.promise.tail` would cause the `get` method to return the tail of the promise chain, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise` is a promise object that has no `head` property. The `get
