  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!q
```
This would result in different behavior because the not (`!`) operator is applied twice to the variable `q`, whereas in the original code fragment it is applied once to the variable `p`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p && q
```
This would result in different behavior because the variables `p` and `q` are now being used in a conjunction (`&&`) rather than being negated twice with the not (`!`) operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `p` is now being replaced with the constant `1`, which is always truthy.

DONE.
