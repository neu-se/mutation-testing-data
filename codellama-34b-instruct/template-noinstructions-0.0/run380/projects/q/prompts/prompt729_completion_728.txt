  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for an array of values, but the first value would be missing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for an array of values, but the last value would be null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.map(function(promise) { return promise.then(function(value) { return value + 1; }); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for an array of values, but each value would be incremented by 1.

DONE.
