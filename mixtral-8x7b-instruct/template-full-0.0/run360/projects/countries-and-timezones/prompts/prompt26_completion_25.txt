 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the Daylight Saving Time (DST) offset string to '+00:00', regardless of the actual offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the DST offset string to the same value as the UTC offset string, which might not be accurate if the DST offset is different from the UTC offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the DST offset string to a random value between -1 and 1, which is unlikely to represent a valid timezone offset.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing process can help identify potential weaknesses in the test suite and provide a starting point for improving it.
