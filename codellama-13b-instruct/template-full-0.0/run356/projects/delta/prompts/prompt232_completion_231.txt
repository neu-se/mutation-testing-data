  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return the length of the next operation in the other iterator, while this code fragment would return the length of the next operation plus one.

DONE.
