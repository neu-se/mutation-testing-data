  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.length` would return the number of verbs in the `verbs` object, whereas `this.verbs` would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs[0]` would return the first verb in the `verbs` object, whereas `this.verbs` would return the entire object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all but the first verb in the `verbs` object, whereas `this.verbs` would return the entire object.

DONE.
