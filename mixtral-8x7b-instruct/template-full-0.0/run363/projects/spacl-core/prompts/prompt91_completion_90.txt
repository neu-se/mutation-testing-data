 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop will not iterate over any policies, and no new policies will be added to the `PolicyMap`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would enter an infinite loop, adding the same policies repeatedly to the `PolicyMap`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would iterate over the keys of the `PolicyMap` instead of the passed-in policies, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
