  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all(object)` would return a promise that resolves to an array of promises, rather than a promise that resolves to the original object. This would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on an array of promises, rather than the original object, which would likely result in a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(object)` would return a promise that resolves to the original object, rather than the original object itself. This would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a promise, rather than the original object, which would likely result in a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This would
