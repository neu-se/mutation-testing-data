  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the first progress listener, whereas the original code calls all progress listeners.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners[progressListeners.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the last progress listener, whereas the original code calls all progress listeners.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners[Math.floor(Math.random() * progressListeners.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a random progress listener, whereas the original code calls all progress listeners.

DONE.
