Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `retain` operation to always retain a length of 1, regardless of the actual length of the operation being processed, potentially leading to incorrect transformations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` operation to effectively ignore the current operation, which could lead to data loss or incorrect state in the resulting `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increase the length of the `retain` operation by 1, which could lead to retaining more characters than intended, thus altering the expected transformation outcome.

DONE.
