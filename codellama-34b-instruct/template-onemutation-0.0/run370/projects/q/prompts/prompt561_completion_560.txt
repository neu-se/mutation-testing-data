  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.value
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `isStopIteration` function is called with `exception` as an argument, which is an exception object. However, in the modified code, `isStopIteration` is called with `exception.value` as an argument, which is the value of the exception object. This could cause the `isStopIteration` function to behave differently, depending on the implementation of the function.
