 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it randomly selects a number between 0 and 9, instead of using the zoom level provided to the function. This can lead to incorrect tile calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the tile's y-coordinate to 1, regardless of the input coordinates and zoom level. This can lead to incorrect tile calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the zoom level by 1, which can lead to incorrect tile calculations. This might not cause all tests to fail, but it would expose issues in tests related to the `toTile` function.

DONE.
