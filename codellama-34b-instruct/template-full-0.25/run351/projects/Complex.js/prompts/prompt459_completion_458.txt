  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] !== 0 || this['im'] !== 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, while this new code checks if the real or imaginary part is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is not at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, while this new code checks if the real and imaginary parts are both equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, while this new code checks if the real and imaginary parts are not both equal to
