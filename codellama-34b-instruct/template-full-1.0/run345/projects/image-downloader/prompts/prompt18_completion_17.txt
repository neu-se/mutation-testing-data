  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, Path.basename(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because it extracts the basename of the `options.dest` instead of the filename.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, decodeURIComponent(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because it decodes the entire `pathname` instead of just the `basename`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, path.basename(path.dirname(pathname))
```
This would result in different behavior because it extracts the basename of the parent directory of the `pathname` instead of the `pathname` itself.

DONE.
