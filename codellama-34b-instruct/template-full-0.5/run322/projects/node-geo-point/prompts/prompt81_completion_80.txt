  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of λ1 instead of the longitude value from the coordinate object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude value instead of the longitude value from the coordinate object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the longitude value from the coordinate object, which would result in a different destination point.

DONE.
