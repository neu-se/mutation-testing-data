  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(prop) => !prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the value returned by `prop`, so if `prop` is `true`, the resulting behavior would be different than the original code where `prop` is returned unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(prop) => { prop + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the value returned by `prop`, so if `prop` is `2`, the resulting behavior would be different than the original code where `prop` is returned unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(prop) => { prop * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the value returned by `prop`, so if `prop` is `3`, the resulting behavior would be different than the original code where `prop` is returned unchanged.

DONE.
