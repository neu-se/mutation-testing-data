  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is equal to `undefined`, while this replacement checks if `val` is not equal to `undefined`. This would cause the `set` method to always delete the key from the cache, even if the value is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is equal to `undefined`, while this replacement checks if the type of `val` is equal to the string `'undefined'`. This would cause the `set` method to always delete the key from the cache, even if the value is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is equal to `undefined`, while this replacement checks if `val` is equal to `null`. This would cause
