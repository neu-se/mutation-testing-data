 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it no longer checks if `embedType` is falsy, allowing operations with different embed types to be considered equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
embedType && embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `embedType` is not equal to the key of `b`, allowing operations with a falsy `embedType` to be considered equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
embedType !== (b as any).key
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly compares the `embedType` with a non-existent property `key` of object `b`, which would always evaluate to `false`, allowing operations with different embed types to be considered equal.

DONE.
