  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.resolve(value)` instead of `deferred.reject(value)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.resolve(value)` instead of `deferred.reject(value)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.resolve(value)` instead of `deferred.notify(value)`.

DONE.
