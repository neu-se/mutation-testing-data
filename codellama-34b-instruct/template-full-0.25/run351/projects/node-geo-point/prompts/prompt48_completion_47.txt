  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is not defined in the code snippet, and the `φ2` variable is not defined either.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function is not defined in the code snippet, and the `φ2` variable is not defined either.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 180 * φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is not defined in the code snippet, and the `φ2` variable is not defined either.

DONE.
