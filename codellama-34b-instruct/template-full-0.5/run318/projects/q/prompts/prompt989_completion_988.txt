  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method of the `Array` prototype, but it is not being called as a method here. Instead, it is being called as a standalone function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method of the `Array` prototype, but it is not being called as a method here. Instead, it is being called as a standalone function.
