  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reverse` reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas `array_slice` creates a new array with the selected elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_concat` concatenates two or more arrays, whereas `array_slice` selects a subset of elements from an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` creates a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `array_slice` selects a subset of elements from an array based on their position.

DONE.
