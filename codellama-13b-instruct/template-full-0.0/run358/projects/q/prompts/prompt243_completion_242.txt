  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `become` function to be called with the same promise object, resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `become` function to be called with a new promise object, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `become` function to be called with the same promise object, resulting in an infinite loop.

DONE.
