  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a different method than `resolve`, and it would change the promise's state to fulfilled instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a different method than `resolve`, and it would change the promise's state to rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a different method than `resolve`, and it would change the promise's state to pending instead of resolved.

DONE.
