  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `promiseDispatch` is not a method of `Promise`, and would therefore cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to a specific context, which would change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` allows the function to be called with a specific context and arguments, which would change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
