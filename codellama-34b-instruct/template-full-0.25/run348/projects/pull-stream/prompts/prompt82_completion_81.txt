  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, cb || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with the `abort` argument, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment only calls `read` with the `null` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if (end === true) {
    cb(end);
  } else {
    cb(null, data);
  }
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with a different callback function that checks the `end` argument and calls the `cb` function with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if (end === true) {
    cb(end);
  } else {
    cb(null, data);
  }
})
```
