  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a new string or array, while `field` is a reference to the original string or array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` returns a new string with all characters in uppercase, while `field` is a reference to the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the length of the string, while `field` is a reference to the original string.

DONE.
