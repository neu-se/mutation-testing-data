Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of the `this` keyword, potentially leading to unexpected results if the `descriptor` methods rely on the correct context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the first argument would mean that the `resolve` function is never called, causing the promise to remain unresolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, "nonExistentOp", args
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call a method that does not exist on the `descriptor`, which would trigger the fallback function and lead to a rejection instead of executing a valid operation.

DONE.
