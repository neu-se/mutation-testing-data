  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be decremented instead of incremented, which could cause the loop to terminate prematurely or skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be incremented by 2 instead of 1, which could cause the loop to skip over certain elements in the array or terminate prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be assigned the value of `index + 1` instead of being incremented, which could cause the loop to terminate prematurely or skip over certain elements in the array.

DONE.
