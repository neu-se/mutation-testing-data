  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to replace the protocol, while the new code uses 'https://' which would result in a different URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to replace the protocol, while the new code uses 'http://www.' which would result in a different URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to replace the protocol, while the new code uses 'http://example.com' which would result in a different URL.

DONE.
