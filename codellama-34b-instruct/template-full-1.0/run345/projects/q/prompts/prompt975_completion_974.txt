  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its first argument, but `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its first argument, but `123` is a number and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its first argument, but `{}` is an object and would cause an error.

DONE.
