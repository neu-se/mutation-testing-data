Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the original logic, returning true for cases where the test passes instead of failing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) && data.length > 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional condition that only returns true if the data has a length greater than zero, potentially filtering out valid cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) || data === null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new condition that returns true if the data is null, which changes the filtering logic significantly.

DONE.
