Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + '/extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an extra path segment to the base URL, potentially leading to incorrect URL resolution when constructing the absolute URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the base URL to null, which would cause the URL resolution logic to fail, resulting in the current URL being treated as an absolute URL instead of a relative one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the base URL string to uppercase, which may lead to incorrect URL parsing and resolution, especially if the original URL is case-sensitive.

DONE.
