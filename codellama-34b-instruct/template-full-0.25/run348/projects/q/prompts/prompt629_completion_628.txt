  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `value` parameter is incremented by 1 before being passed to the `set` method, which would cause the value to be different from the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `value` parameter is decremented by 1 before being passed to the `set` method, which would cause the value to be different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `value` parameter is multiplied by 2 before being passed to the `set` method, which would cause the value to be different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
