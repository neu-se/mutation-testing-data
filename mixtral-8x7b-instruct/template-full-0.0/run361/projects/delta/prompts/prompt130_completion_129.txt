 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always starts the slice from the beginning, regardless of the `start` parameter value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it always starts the slice from the end, regardless of the `start` parameter value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index
```
This would result in different behavior because it always starts the slice from the current index, instead of starting from the `start` parameter value.

DONE.
