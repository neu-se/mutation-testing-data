Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of adding the callbacks to the queue for later execution, it would attempt to delete the key from the queue, potentially causing the callbacks to never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key).forEach(cb => cb());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately execute all callbacks associated with the key instead of queuing them for later execution, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the data is not yet persisted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the callbacks for the key to an empty array, effectively discarding any previously queued callbacks, which means they would never be executed.

DONE.
