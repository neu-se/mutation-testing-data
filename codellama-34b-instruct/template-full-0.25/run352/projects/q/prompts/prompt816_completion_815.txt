  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a different method than `done`, and it has a different purpose. `fail` is used to handle rejections, while `done` is used to handle fulfillments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a different method than `done`, and it has a different purpose. `then` is used to chain promises, while `done` is used to handle fulfillments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a different method than `done`, and it has a different purpose. `catch` is used to handle rejections, while `done` is used to handle fulfillments.

DONE.
