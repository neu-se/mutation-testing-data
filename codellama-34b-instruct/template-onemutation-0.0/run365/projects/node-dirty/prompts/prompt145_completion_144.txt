  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', err);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'drain' event only when there are no more in-flight writes and the write stream is not waiting for a drain, while the modified code emits the 'drain' event regardless of the state of the write stream.
