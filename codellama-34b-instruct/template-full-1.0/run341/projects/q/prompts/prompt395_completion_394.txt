  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because void 0 is a falsy value in JavaScript, so the `then` method would not be called, even if it is available on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is also a falsy value in JavaScript, so the `then` method would not be called, even if it is available on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 is a falsy value in JavaScript, so the `then` method would not be called, even if it is available on the object.

DONE.
