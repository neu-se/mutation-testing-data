  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` property is being incremented by 1, which would cause the `substr` method to return a different substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` property is being decremented by 1, which would cause the `substr` method to return a different substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` property is being multiplied by 2, which would cause the `substr` method to return a different substring.

DONE.
