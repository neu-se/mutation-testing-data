  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value that indicates whether the operation has been aborted, while `null` is a null value that does not indicate any specific condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value that indicates whether the operation has been aborted, while `undefined` is a value that indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value that indicates whether the operation has been aborted, while `false` is a boolean value that indicates that the operation has not been aborted.

DONE.
