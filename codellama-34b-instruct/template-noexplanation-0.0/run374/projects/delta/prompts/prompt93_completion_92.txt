  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This change will cause the new operation to be inserted at the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp)
```
This change will cause the new operation to be inserted at the specified index in the `ops` array, rather than at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp)
```
This change will cause the new operation to be inserted at the end of the `ops` array, which is the same behavior as the original code.

DONE.
