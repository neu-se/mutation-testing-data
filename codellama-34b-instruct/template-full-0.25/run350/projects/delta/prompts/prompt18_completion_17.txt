  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return `b`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to return the sum of `a` and `b`, rather than the difference between them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to return the difference between `a` and `b`, rather than the sum.

DONE.
