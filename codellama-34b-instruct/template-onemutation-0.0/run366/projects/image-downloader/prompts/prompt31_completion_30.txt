  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `trimLeft()` with no arguments, which removes whitespace from the beginning of the string, while the new code fragment uses `trimLeft(10)`, which removes the first 10 characters of the string, regardless of whether they are whitespace or not. This could cause the code to behave differently for URLs that have non-whitespace characters at the beginning.

DONE.
