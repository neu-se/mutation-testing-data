 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because empty lines are now considered part of a valid row, which could lead to unexpected behavior when parsing the rows.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash before the 'n' would prevent the newline character from being recognized, causing issues with parsing the rows.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'</PLACEHOLDER>'
```
This would result in different behavior because the closing tag would not be recognized as a newline character, causing issues with parsing the rows.

DONE.
