  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is not defined in the `options` object, so it would return `undefined` instead of a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `deprecated` property of the `options` object to `true`, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return all timezones instead of only returning non-deprecated ones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `deprecated` property of the `options` object to `false`, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return only non-deprecated timezones instead of all timezones.

DONE.
