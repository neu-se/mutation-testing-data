 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with an error, even if the source data is not an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string as an error, while the original code fragment passes the error object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the data as an error, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
