  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would not be called, and no error would be handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would be called, and the error would be handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would be called, and the error would be handled.

DONE.
