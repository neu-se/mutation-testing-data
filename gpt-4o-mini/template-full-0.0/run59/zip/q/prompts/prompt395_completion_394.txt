Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.thenReject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to always reject with the provided value instead of resolving, leading to a failure in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function() { return undefined; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `undefined`, which may not be the intended value, potentially causing issues in subsequent promise handlers that expect a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function() { throw new Error("Forced error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw a new error when the promise is resolved, causing the promise to be rejected regardless of the original resolution value.

DONE.
