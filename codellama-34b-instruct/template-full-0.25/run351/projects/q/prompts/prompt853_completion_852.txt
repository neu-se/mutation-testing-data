  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a different function than `clearTimeout`, and it would cause the timeout to be cleared at an interval rather than after a specific amount of time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` would create a new timeout rather than clearing the existing one, and it would cause the promise to be rejected after a new amount of time rather than after the original timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear a different timeout than the one that was originally set, and it would cause the promise to be rejected after a different amount of time than the original timeout.

DONE.
