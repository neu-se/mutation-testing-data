  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` calculates the cosine of the input value, whereas `sin` calculates the sine. In the code, `sinφ2` is calculated as the sine of the sum of `φ1` and `δ`. Replacing `sinφ2` with `cosφ2` would produce a different result and lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` calculates the tangent of an angle, whereas `sin` and `cos` calculate the sine and cosine, respectively. In the code, `sinθ` and `cosθ` are used to calculate the angle between two points. Replacing them with `tanθ` would produce a different result and lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
π - θ
```
This would result in different behavior because `θ` is the angle between
