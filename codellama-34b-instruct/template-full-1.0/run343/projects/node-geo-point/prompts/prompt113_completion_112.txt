  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude / Math.PI * 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the division operator is reversed, which would produce a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / coordinate.latitude * 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is moved before the division operator, which would produce a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because a different variable is used, which would produce a different value.

DONE.
