  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 0 instead of 1, meaning that the function would execute the body of the loop one less time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element of the array instead of the first, meaning that the function would execute the body of the loop in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the middle element of the array instead of the first, meaning that the function would execute the body of the loop in a different order.

DONE.
