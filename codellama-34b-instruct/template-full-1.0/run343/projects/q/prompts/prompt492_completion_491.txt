  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, resulting in untracked rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with `null` as the promise, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with `undefined` as the promise, which would cause an error.

DONE.
