  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the part count difference is exactly 1, while this change would check if it is greater than 1, which would result in different branches being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if part of the link url path is present in the page url path, while this change would check if the link url path starts with the page url path, which would result in different branches being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the page url path is present in the link url path, while this change would check if the link url path includes the page url path, which would result in different branches being executed.

DONE.
