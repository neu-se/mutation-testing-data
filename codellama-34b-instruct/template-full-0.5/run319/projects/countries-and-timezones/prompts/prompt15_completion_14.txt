  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tz.r` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tz.r` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is equal to undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tz.r` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to undefined.

DONE.
