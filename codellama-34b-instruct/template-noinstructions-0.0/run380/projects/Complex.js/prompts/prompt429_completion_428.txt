  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `1`, causing the `Math.pow` function to always return `10`, regardless of the value of `places`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `0`, causing the `Math.pow` function to always return `1`, regardless of the value of `places`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return the value of `places`, causing the `Math.pow` function to always return `10`, regardless of the value of `places`.

DONE.
