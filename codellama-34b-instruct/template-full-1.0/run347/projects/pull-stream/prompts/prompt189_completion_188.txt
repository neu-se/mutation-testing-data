  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and it would cause the onAbort callback to be invoked with a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `null`, and it would cause the onAbort callback to be invoked with a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"failed", array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because "failed" is a different string than the original code fragment, and it would cause the onAbort callback to be invoked with a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
