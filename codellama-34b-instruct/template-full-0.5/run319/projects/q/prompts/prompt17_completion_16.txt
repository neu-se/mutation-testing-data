  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("Something went wrong!"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to throw an error, which would be caught by the promise's `catch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to return the value `42`, which would be caught by the promise's `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "Hello, world!"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to return the string "Hello, world!", which would be caught by the promise's `then` method.

DONE.
