  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always add 1 to the current token, which would change the calculation of the complex number's real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to double the current token, which would change the calculation of the complex number's real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to negate the current token, which would flip the sign of the complex number's real part.

DONE.
