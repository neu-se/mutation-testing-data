  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b || b !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to `b` or if `b` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(a > b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is greater than `b` is not true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(a < b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is less than `b` is not true.

DONE.
