  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the error object instead of being resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified with the error object instead of being resolved or rejected.

DONE.
