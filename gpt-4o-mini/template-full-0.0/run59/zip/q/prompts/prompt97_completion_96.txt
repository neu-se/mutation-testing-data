Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the loop to run one additional iteration beyond the last valid index of the array, potentially causing an "undefined" value to be accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively increases the upper limit of the loop, leading to an out-of-bounds access on the array, which could result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate immediately if the index is greater than the length, preventing any iterations from occurring and thus not processing any elements of the array.

DONE.
