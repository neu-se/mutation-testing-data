  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is always truthy, so the resulting function would always return `null`. In the original code, `end` is checked for strict equality to `true` before returning `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'end'` is a string, so the resulting function would always return the string `'end'` instead of `null`. In the original code, `end` is checked for strict equality to `true` before returning `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is always falsy, so the resulting function would always return `acc` instead of `null`. In the original code, `end` is checked for strict equality to `true` before returning `null`.

DONE.
