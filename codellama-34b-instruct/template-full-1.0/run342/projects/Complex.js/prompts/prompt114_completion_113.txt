  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(a) / b;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the result of the `parseFloat` function by `b`, which could potentially change the value of the returned complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(parseFloat(a) / b);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the result of the `parseFloat` function before dividing it by `b`, which could potentially change the value of the returned complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(a) % b;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the remainder of the `parseFloat` function result and `b`, which could potentially change the value of the returned complex number.

DONE.
