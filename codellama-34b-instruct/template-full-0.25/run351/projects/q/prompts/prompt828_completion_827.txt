  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles uncaught errors, and by setting it to `null`, any uncaught errors would be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Uncaught error"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error for any uncaught errors, even if the original code would have handled them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { console.log("Uncaught error"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log any uncaught errors to the console, but not throw an error or handle them in any other way.

DONE.
