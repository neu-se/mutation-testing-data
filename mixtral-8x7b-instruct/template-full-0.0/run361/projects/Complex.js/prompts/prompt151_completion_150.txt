 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use `this['re']` if it's not falsy, otherwise use 1, instead of checking if `this['re']` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `this['im']` with `z['re']`, instead of checking if `z['im']` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * z['re'] - this['im'] * z['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of the multiplication, which would change the outcome for certain input values.

DONE.
