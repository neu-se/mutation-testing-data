  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the total offset by adding the UTC offset and the DST offset, while this new code fragment calculates the total offset by adding the UTC offset and the DST offset, but then adds the result to the UTC offset again, which would result in a different total offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset - dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the total offset by adding the UTC offset and the DST offset, while this new code fragment calculates the total offset by subtracting the DST offset from the UTC offset, which would result in a different total offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset - utcOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the total offset by adding the UTC offset and the DST offset, while this new code fragment calculates the total offset by
