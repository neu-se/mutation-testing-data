```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the `c` variable is not defined in the code snippet provided, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d
```
This would result in different behavior because the `d` variable is not defined in the code snippet provided, and would cause a reference error.
