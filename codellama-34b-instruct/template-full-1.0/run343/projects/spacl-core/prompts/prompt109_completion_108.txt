  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(<PLACEHOLDER>, path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `path` and `ctx` as arguments instead of `path` and `undefined`, which could cause the `matches` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx, <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `ctx` and `undefined` as arguments instead of `path` and `ctx`, which could cause the `matches` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `0` as an additional argument to the `matches` method, which could cause the method to return a different result or throw an error if it is not expecting a third argument.

DONE.
