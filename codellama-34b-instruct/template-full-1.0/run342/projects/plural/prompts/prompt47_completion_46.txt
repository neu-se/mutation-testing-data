  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds 'es'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'x' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds 'x'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment does not.

DONE.
