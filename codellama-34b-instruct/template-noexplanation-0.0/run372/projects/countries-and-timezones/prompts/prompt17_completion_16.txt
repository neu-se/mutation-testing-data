Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r || id
```
This code fragment is a reference to the `r` property of the `tz` object, but if it is undefined, it will return the `id` variable instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r && id
```
This code fragment is a reference to the `r` property of the `tz` object, but if it is undefined, it will return the `id` variable instead. This change will cause the `buildCountry` function to
