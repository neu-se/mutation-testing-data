  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is no longer the same, and it would match a different set of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/|:$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regex match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/|:$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which makes the regex case-insensitive, so it would match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

DONE.
