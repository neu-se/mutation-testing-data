 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `ended` value or an error to the callback, while this modification always passes `true` as the error, which might not accurately represent the actual state of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` value to the callback, while this modification passes `undefined`, which might not provide the necessary information to the caller.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` value to the callback, while this modification passes `null`, which might not provide the necessary information to the caller and could potentially hide the fact that no data was actually read.

DONE.
