  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include a call to `then`, which is a method of the `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include a call to `catch`, which is a method of the `Promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include a call to `finally`, which is a method of the `Promise` object.

DONE.
