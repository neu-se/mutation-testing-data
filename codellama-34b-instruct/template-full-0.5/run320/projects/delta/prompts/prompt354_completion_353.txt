  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inverted.chop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is not called with the correct number of arguments, which would cause the function to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inverted.chop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is not called with the correct number of arguments, which would cause the function to return an incorrect value.
