  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would cause the `floor` function to round up to the next integer instead of rounding down.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 would cause the `floor` function to round down to the previous integer instead of rounding up.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places * 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 0.5 would cause the `floor` function to round down to half the previous integer instead of rounding down to the previous integer.

DONE.
