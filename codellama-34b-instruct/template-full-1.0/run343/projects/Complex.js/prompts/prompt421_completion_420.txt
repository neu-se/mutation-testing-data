  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator would cause the expression to always evaluate to false, even if the input is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would always evaluate to 1, even if the input is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would check if the input is infinite, rather than zero.

DONE.
