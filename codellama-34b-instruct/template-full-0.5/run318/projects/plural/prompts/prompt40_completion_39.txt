  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of the word by removing the last two characters and adding "ices", while this new code fragment removes only the last character and adds "ices".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of the word by removing the last two characters and adding "ices", while this new code fragment removes only the last two characters and adds "i".
