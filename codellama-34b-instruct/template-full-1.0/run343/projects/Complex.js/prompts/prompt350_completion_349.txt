  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in a division by zero, since the expression `0 / 0` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in a different calculation, since the expression `1 + 1` is equivalent to `2`, which is different from the original calculation of `a + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in a different calculation, since the expression `b + 1` is different from the original calculation of `a + 1`.

DONE.
