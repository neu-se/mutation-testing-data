  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'foo' to the path, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the path to uppercase, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path on the '/' character and return the first element, which may not be intended.

DONE.
