  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would cause the function to not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to the `parser_exit` function, while this code fragment passes the argument `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to the `parser_exit` function, while this code fragment passes the argument `0`.

DONE.
