 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return e^x instead of the absolute value of x.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
