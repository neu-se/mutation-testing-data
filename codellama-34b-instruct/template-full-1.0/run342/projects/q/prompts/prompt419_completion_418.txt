  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `isRejected` method on the `Promise` instance, which would return a different value than `inspect`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of `isFulfilled`, which would return the opposite value of `inspect`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `Promise` instance is pending, which would return a different value than `inspect`.

DONE.
