  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `spec` string matches the given regular expression, while the new code fragment checks if it does not match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `spec` string matches the given regular expression, while the new code fragment checks if it is undefined.
