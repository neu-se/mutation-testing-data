  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first character of the string instead of the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third character of the string instead of the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last character of the string instead of the entire string.

DONE.
