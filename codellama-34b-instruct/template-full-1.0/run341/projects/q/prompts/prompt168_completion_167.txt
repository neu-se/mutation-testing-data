  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("From previous event:") === -1 && !isNodeFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out lines that contain the string "From previous event:".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.charAt(0) !== "A" && !isNodeFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out lines that start with the letter "A".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length > 50 && !isNodeFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out lines that are longer than 50 characters.

DONE.
