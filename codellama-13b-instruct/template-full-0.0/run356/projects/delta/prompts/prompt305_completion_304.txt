  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true when the line has a length greater than 1, rather than just when it has a length greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true when the line has a length less than 0, rather than just when it has a length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true only when the line has a length of 0, rather than just when it has a length greater than 0.

DONE.
