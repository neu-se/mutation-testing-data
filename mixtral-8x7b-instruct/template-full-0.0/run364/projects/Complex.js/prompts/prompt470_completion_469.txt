 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 === b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if b is equal to 1, instead of not equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if b is not equal to 0, instead of not equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if b is greater than 1, instead of not equal to 1.

DONE.
