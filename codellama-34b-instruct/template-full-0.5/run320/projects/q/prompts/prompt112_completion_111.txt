  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(thisp, [value, index, self])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array of arguments, while `call` expects a list of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `undefined` argument is passed to the callback function, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because a `null` value is passed as the fourth argument, which may cause the callback function to behave differently.

DONE.
