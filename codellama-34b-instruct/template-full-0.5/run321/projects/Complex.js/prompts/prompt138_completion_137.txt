  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isInfinite()` method, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `z` is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite()` method checks if a value is a finite number, whereas the `isInfinite()` method checks if a value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN()` method checks if a value is not a number, whereas the `isInfinite()` method checks if a value is infinite.

DONE.
