  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the content to uppercase, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the content, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the content into an array of characters, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
