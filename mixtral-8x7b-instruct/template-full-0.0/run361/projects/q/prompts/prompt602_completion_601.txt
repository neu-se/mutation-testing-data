 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method checks if the `object` is null or undefined and throws an error if it is. By replacing it with null, the error-checking behavior changes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called on the promise instance, not on the `this` context. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `this`, the behavior of the `dispatch` method changes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects the `object` to have a `promiseDispatch` method, which is not present in the `Promise.resolve()` object. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `Promise.resolve()`, the behavior of the `dispatch` method changes.

DONE.
