  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```

/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to match any vowel or the letter "y" at the end of a word, instead of just matching vowels. This would cause the function to return a different value for words that end in a consonant followed by "o", such as "photo" or "logo".
