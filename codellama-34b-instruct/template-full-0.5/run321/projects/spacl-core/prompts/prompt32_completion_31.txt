  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc + '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the accumulator and segment, while this new code fragment concatenates the segment and accumulator, resulting in a different final string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg.replace(/^/, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the accumulator and segment, while this new code fragment replaces the beginning of the segment with the accumulator, resulting in a different final string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg.slice(0, acc.length) + acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the accumulator and segment, while this new code fragment takes the first `acc.length` characters of the segment and concatenates them with the accumulator, resulting in a different final string.

DONE
