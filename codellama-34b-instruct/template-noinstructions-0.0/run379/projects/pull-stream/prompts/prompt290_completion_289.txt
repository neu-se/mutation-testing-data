  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being modified, which could affect the output of the `unique` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being multiplied by 2, which could also affect the output of the `unique` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being converted to uppercase, which could affect the output of the `unique` function if it is case-sensitive.

DONE.
