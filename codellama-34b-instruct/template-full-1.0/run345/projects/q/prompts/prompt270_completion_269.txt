  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable would now be incremented by 1, which could change the behavior of the `reject` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable would now be multiplied by 2, which could change the behavior of the `reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would now be passed a string value instead of the `reason` variable, which could change the behavior of the `reject` function.

DONE.
