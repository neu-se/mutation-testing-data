  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` returns a resolved promise, while `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('Different error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('The options.dest is required'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is the same, but the error is thrown from a different location in the code.

DONE.
