  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => 0
```
Since the `AttributeMap.invert` method is not defined, replacing it with a function that ignores its arguments and returns 0 will result in incorrect behavior when transforming attribute maps. The original method would invert the attribute map, which is important for maintaining the correct delta composition. However, the corrected method will always return 0, which may result in incorrect delta composition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of values, while `AttributeMap.invert` returns an attribute map. This means that when transforming attribute maps, the corrected method would return an array of values, which is not the correct return type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta => delta.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.ops` returns an array of operations, while `AttributeMap.invert` returns an attribute map. This means that
