  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `push` method would not be called if the item is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the `push` method would not be called if the item is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is called with a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
