  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_toString` is a function that expects to be called with a `this` value of an object, but `bind(null)` will cause it to be called with `this` set to `null`, which may cause it to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call(null)` will cause `object_toString` to be called with `this` set to `null`, which may cause it to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply(null)` will cause `object_toString` to be called with `this` set to `null`, which may cause it to throw an error or return an unexpected result.
