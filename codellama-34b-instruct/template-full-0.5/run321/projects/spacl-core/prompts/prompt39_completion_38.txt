  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an empty array, and the `reverse` method would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array with one element, and the `reverse` method would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array with one element, and the `reverse` method would not be called.

DONE.
