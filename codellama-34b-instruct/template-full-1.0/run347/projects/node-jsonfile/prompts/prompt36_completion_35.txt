  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the encoding of the file being read or wrote to.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the async function to always throw an error, even when the `throws` option is set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.flag
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the file mode flag used when writing the file.

DONE.
