  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the index of the current iteration instead of the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[index])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of the current iteration instead of the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[index].key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the key of the current iteration instead of the index.

DONE.
