  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, while `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer. This change would cause the `x` coordinate of the tile to be off by one, leading to a different tile being selected.
