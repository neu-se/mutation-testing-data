 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'mice' for the input 'mouse', while this change would return 'mouses'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return 'mouses' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has a string literal as the second argument of the `addRule` function, while this change would use a function that returns a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'houses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has a specific rule for the input 'mouse', while this change would use a generic rule that doesn't take into account the special case of the input 'mouse'.

DONE.
