 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['then']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses bracket notation instead of dot notation, which might not work as expected if 'then' is a computed property or if there's an invalid property name collision.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.then.bind(null)
