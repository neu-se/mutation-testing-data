  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a resolver, but in this case, the returned resolver is not used, so the behavior would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` takes an argument, but here it is passed `undefined`, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` takes an argument, but here it is passed `null`, which would cause an error.

DONE.
