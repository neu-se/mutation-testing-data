  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to `'Point'`, which would always return `false` if the `point` object is a `Point` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `point` object does not have the `type` and `coordinates` properties, which would always return `false` if the `point` object is a `Point` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property of the `point` object does not have a length of 2, which would always return `false` if the `point`
