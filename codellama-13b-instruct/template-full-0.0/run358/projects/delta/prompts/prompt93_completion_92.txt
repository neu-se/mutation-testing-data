  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift` method adds an element to the beginning of the array, while the original code fragment adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method adds an element to the array at a specific index, while the original code fragment adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method adds an element to the end of the array, while the original code fragment adds an element to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
