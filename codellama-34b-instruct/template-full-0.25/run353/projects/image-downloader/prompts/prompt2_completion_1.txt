  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('Something went wrong'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a rejected promise with a custom error message, whereas the original code fragment creates a rejected promise with a default error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('The options.dest is required'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a rejected promise with a custom error message that is different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
