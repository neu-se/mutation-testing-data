  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty object, even if the original code fragment returned a non-empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the attributes object, which may be different from the length of the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the attributes object, which may be different from the first element of the original object.

DONE.
