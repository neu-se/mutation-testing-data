  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the offset value by 1 minute, which may affect the result of the `getOffsetStr()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the offset value, which may affect the result of the `getOffsetStr()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.s
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a different property `s` instead of `d`, which may affect the logic of the function.

DONE.
