Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the longitude of `point2` instead of the longitude of `point1`, leading to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the converted longitude, which would skew the distance calculation, resulting in an inaccurate distance value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the converted longitude by 2, effectively doubling the value and leading to an incorrect distance calculation between the two points.

DONE.
