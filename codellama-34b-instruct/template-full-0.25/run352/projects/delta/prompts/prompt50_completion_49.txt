  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[0]` is a different value than `b`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `b.length` is a different value than `b`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

DONE.
