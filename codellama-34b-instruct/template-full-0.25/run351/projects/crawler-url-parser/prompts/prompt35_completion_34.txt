  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods are being applied to the `currentUrlStr` variable, which would cause the URL to be reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method is being applied to the `currentUrlStr` variable, which would cause the URL to be converted to uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace('http', 'https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is being applied to the `currentUrlStr` variable, which would cause the URL to be replaced with a secure version (i.e., `https` instead of `http`).

DONE.
