  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `w.replace` is a method call that replaces the first occurrence of the regular expression `/a/` with the string `'e'`, while the new code fragment `w.replace(/a/, 'e')` is a method call that replaces all occurrences of the regular expression `/a/` with the string `'e'`.

DONE.
