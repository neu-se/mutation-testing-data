  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the original code fragment matches the beginning of the string only if it does not start with a valid URL scheme (e.g. http://, https://, etc.), while the new code fragment would always replace the beginning of the string with 'http://', regardless of whether it starts with a valid URL scheme or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the original code fragment matches the beginning of the string only if it does not start with a valid URL scheme (e.g. http://, https://, etc.), while the new code fragment would always replace the beginning of the string with 'https://', regardless of whether it starts with a valid URL scheme or not.
