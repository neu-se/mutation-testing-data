  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split.("a")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the split() method without arguments, which splits the string at every occurrence of whitespace, while this code fragment uses the split() method with an argument of "a", which splits the string at every occurrence of the letter "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/[a-z]/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the split() method to split the string at every occurrence of whitespace, while this code fragment uses the replace() method with a regular expression to remove all lowercase letters from the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the split() method to split the string at every occurrence of whitespace, while this code fragment uses the slice() method to extract a substring
