Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison to check if the destination parent is the same as the source, rather than checking if it's the root path, potentially causing incorrect results when checking for subdirectories.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.parse(src).root
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison to check if the destination parent is the same as the root of the source, rather than the root of the destination parent, potentially causing incorrect results when checking for subdirectories.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison to check if the destination parent is the same as the root directory, rather than the root of the destination parent, potentially causing incorrect results when checking for subdirectories on non-Unix-like systems.

DONE.
