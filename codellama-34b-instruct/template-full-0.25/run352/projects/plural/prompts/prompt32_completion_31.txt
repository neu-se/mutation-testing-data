  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is now removing three characters instead of two, which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that end in "thesis" or "crisis".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is now adding the letter "s" instead of "es", which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that end in "thesis" or "crisis".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 's' }
