  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the lowercase version of the timezone name, which could cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split(' ').join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any spaces from the timezone name, which could cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the timezone name, which could cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.

DONE.
