  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of `at` by 1, which could cause the `untrackRejection` method to index into the `unhandledReasons` array incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
at * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `at`, which could cause the `untrackRejection` method to index into the `unhandledReasons` array incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
at ^ 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the bitwise XOR of `at` with 2, which could cause the `untrackRejection` method to index into the `unhandledReasons` array incorrectly.

DONE.
