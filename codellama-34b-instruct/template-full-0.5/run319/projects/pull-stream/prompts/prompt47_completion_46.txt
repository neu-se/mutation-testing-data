  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time, potentially accessing an undefined element in the `arguments` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as `i` would always be less than `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, as `i` would be equal to `length` only on the first iteration.

DONE.
