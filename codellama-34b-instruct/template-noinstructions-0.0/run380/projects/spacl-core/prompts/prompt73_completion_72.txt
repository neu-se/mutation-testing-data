  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx` parameter is missing, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` parameter is missing, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` parameter is missing, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
