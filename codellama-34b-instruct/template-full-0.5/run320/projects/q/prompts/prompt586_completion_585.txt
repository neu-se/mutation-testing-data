  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is not a valid method for a promise, and it would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then()` method is not a valid method for a promise, and it would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch()` method is not a valid method for a promise, and it would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
