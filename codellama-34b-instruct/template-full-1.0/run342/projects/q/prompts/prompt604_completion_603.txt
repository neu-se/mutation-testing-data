  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(`TypeError: Invalid argument to Q.nextTick: ${args[1]}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to reject, rather than resolving like the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(args[1] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to resolve with a different value than the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(args[1] * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be resolved to a different value, rather than rejecting like the original code does.

DONE.
