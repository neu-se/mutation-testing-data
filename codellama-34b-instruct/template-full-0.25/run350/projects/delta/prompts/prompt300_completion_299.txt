  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first character of the string and return the attributes of the second character instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object instead of the attributes of the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes || iter.next(1).attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the attributes of the first character if they exist, or the attributes of the second character if they exist, or an empty object if neither exists.

DONE.
