 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the `nextStream` function from being called, even when the current stream has ended. This could cause the function to get stuck and never process any further streams.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `typeof` check to always fail, and the `stream` variable would always be assigned the result of `once('string')`. This could cause the function to process the streams incorrectly or not at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_read` variable to be assigned a random value each time a new stream is processed. This could cause the function to get stuck or process the streams in the wrong order.

DONE.
