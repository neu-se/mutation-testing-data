  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `slice` method would be negative, which would cause the method to return an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `slice` method would be zero, which would cause the method to return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `slice` method would be one, which would cause the method to return the first character of the string.

DONE.
