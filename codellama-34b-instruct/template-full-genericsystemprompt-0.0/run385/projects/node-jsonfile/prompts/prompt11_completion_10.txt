  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, but `data + 1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, but `data.toUpperCase()` is a string with all lowercase letters converted to uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, but `data.split('')` is an array of strings, where each string is a single character from the original string.

DONE.
