  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function would not be called, and the `Complex` object would not be exported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function would be called, but the `Complex` object would not be exported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `define` function would be called, but the `Complex` object would not be exported.

DONE.
