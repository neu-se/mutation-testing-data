  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Node.otherImpressiveProperty();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a different property of the `Node` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `desiredLines` array, instead of adding a new element to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(desiredLines)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves with the `desiredLines` array, instead of adding the stack trace to it.

DONE.
