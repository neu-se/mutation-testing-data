  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a timezone object instead of a country object, which would cause the `getAllCountries` function to return an object with timezone objects instead of country objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options).name }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the country instead of the country object itself, which would cause the `getAllCountries` function to return an object with country names instead of country objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options).timezones[0] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first timezone of the country instead of the country object itself, which would cause the `getAllCountries` function to return an object with timezone objects instead of country objects
