  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(abort === true ? null : abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function is called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function is called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function is called with a different argument than the original code.

DONE.
