  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a `null` value as the first argument, which would cause it to return a different timezone object than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive an `undefined` value as the first argument, which would cause it to return a different timezone object than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive an empty object as the first argument, which would cause it to return a different timezone object than the original code.

DONE.
