  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This will cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to receive `null` as the third argument, which is not a valid value for the `options` parameter. This will likely cause the function to throw an error, which can be caught and reported as a failure in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This will cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to receive an empty object as the third argument, which is not a valid value for the `options` parameter. This will likely cause the function to throw an error, which can be caught and reported as a failure in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This will cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to receive `undefined` as the third argument, which is not a valid value for the `options` parameter. This will likely cause the function to throw an error, which can be caught and reported as a failure in
