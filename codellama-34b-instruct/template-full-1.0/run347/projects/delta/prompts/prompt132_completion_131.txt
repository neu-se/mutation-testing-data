  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the current op is equal to the last op in the ops array, and only pushes the new op if it is not. However, this new code would push the new op unconditionally, even if it is equal to the last op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(ops[index - 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the new op onto the end of the ops array, but this code would push the previous op onto the end of the ops array instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the new op onto the end of the ops array, but this code would insert the new op into the middle of the ops array at the given index.
