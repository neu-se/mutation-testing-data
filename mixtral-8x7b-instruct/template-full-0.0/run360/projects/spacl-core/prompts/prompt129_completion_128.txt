 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
index += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the addition assignment operator, which modifies the `index` variable, instead of the `index++` postfix increment operator, which returns the original value of `index` and then increments it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
++index
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the prefix increment operator, which increments `index` and then returns the new value, instead of the `index++` postfix increment operator, which returns the original value and then increments `index`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.regex.props.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of `this.regex.props` minus one as the loop condition, which would cause the loop to terminate one iteration early if `this.regex.props` has a length greater than zero.
