  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream` is a function, rather than an object. If `stream` is a function, the original code would return `true`, but the mutated code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream.value` is an object, rather than `stream` itself. If `stream.value` is an object, the original code would return `true`, but the mutated code would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

stream && 'function' === typeof stream.value
