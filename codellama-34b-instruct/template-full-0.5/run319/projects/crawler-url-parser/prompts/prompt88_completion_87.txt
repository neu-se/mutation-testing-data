  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the text to lowercase, which could cause the `includes()` method to return `false` even if the text contains the search string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the text into an array of words, which could cause the `includes()` method to return `false` if the search string is not an exact match for one of the words in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().replace(/\s+/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove all whitespace from the text, which could cause the `includes()` method to return `false` if the search string contains whitespace.

DONE.
