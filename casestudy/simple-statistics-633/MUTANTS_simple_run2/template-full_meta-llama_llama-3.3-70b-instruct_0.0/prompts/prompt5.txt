Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
/**
 * The simple [sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) of an array
 * is the result of adding all numbers together, starting from zero.
 *
 * This runs in `O(n)`, linear time, with respect to the length of the array.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x input
 * @return {number} sum of all input numbers
 * @example
 * sumSimple([1, 2, 3]); // => 6
 */
function sumSimple(x) {
    let value = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
        if (<PLACEHOLDER>) {
            return NaN;
        }
        value += x[i];
    }
    return value;
}

export default sumSimple;

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
typeof x[i] !== "number"
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
