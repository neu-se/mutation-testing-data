  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because this modified code fragment would result in a non-integer value for the x coordinate, whereas the original code fragment would always produce an integer value due to the use of the `Math.floor()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because this modified code fragment would result in a different scaling factor for the x coordinate, which would change the position of the tile on the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because this modified code fragment would result in a different scaling
