  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it will always return `false` when `z` is zero, regardless of whether `this` is infinite or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it will always return `true` when `z` is infinite, regardless of whether `this` is infinite or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it will always return `true` when both `this` and `z` are infinite, regardless of whether `this` is infinite or not.

DONE.
