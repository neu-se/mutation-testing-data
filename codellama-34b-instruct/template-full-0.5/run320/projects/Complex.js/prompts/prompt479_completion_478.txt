  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is the real part of the complex number, while the `im` property is the imaginary part. Using `this['re']` instead of `this['im']` would cause the `isInfinite` function to check the real part of the number instead of the imaginary part, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number before checking if it is infinite. This could cause the function to return a different result than the original code, which only checks if the imaginary part is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the imaginary part of the complex number before checking if it is infinite. This could cause the function to
