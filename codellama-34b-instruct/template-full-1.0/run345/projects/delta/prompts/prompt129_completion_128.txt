  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a negative argument, which would return the previous element instead of the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different argument than the original code, which would skip over the next element in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - start + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different argument than the original code, which would return the first element after the end of the iteration instead of the next element in the iteration.

DONE.
