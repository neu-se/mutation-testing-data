  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function is called with two arguments, `end` and `data`, instead of just one argument, `end`, as in the original code. This could cause the `once` function to behave differently, such as calling the `onEnd` callback with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function is called with two arguments, `end` and `data`, instead of just one argument, `end`, as in the original code. This could cause the `onEnd` function to behave differently, such as calling the `onEnd` callback with the wrong arguments.
