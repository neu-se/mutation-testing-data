  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns an array of the keys of the object's properties, while the `values` method returns an array of the values of the object's properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns an array of the keys of the object's properties, while the `length` property returns the number of elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pop"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method returns an array of the keys of the object's properties, while the `pop` method removes the last element from the array and returns it.

DONE.
