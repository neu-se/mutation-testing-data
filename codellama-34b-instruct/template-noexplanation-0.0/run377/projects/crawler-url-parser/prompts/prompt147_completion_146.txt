  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/")
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the "/" character as a delimiter instead of the default delimiter. This can cause the code to behave differently if the linkurl_path contains a "/" character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(" ")
```
This code fragment uses a space character as a delimiter, which can cause the code to behave differently if the linkurl_path contains a space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(linkurl_path.charAt(0))
```
This code fragment uses the first character of the linkurl_path as a delimiter, which can cause the code to behave differently if the linkurl_path starts with a character that is not a "/" or a space.

DONE.
