  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of whether the object has the specified key or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && object[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the object has the specified key and the value of that key is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && object[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the object has the specified key and the value of that key is not `null`.

DONE.
