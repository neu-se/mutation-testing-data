  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

memoizeTimezone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with a `null` argument, which would cause the function to return without modifying the `timezones` object. This would cause the `getTimezone` function to always return `null`, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with a new `Time
