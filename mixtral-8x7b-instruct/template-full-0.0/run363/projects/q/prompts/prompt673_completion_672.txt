 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of `dispatch` should be an object, and `null` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of `dispatch` should be an object, and a number is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects the first argument to be the `this` context, which should be the same as the original `object` in this case. An empty object does not have the same properties and methods as the original `object`.

DONE.
