  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || longitude < -180 || longitude > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for latitude and longitude values outside of the valid ranges, which could cause errors in the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || longitude < -180 || longitude > 180 || radius < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for negative radius values, which could cause errors in the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || longitude < -180 || longitude > 180 || radius < 0 || radius > 10000000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for radius values outside of the valid range, which could cause errors in the calculations.
