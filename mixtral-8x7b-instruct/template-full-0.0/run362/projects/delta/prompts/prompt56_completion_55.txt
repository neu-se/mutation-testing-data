 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `ops` array, and any modifications to the `ops` array in the `Delta` class will not affect the shallow copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.assign([], ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with the same elements as the `ops` array, but does not copy the objects referenced by the elements. Any modifications to the objects in the new array will affect the original objects in the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>ops).concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `concat` method to create a new array with the same elements as the `ops` array, but it also does not copy the objects referenced by the elements. Any modifications to the objects in the new array will
