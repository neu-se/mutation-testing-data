  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the second key in the `otherData` object, rather than the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `otherData` object, rather than the first key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the first key in the `otherData` object plus one, rather than the first key.

DONE.
