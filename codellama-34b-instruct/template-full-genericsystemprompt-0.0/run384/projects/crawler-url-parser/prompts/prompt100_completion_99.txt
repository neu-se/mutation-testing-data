  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the protocol instead of the URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the host instead of the URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing results.

DONE.
