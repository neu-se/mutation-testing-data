Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `next` method to increment the index and reset the offset only when the length is less than the remaining length of the operation, potentially skipping operations that should be fully processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the index to increment and the offset to reset when the length exactly matches the remaining length of the operation, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations that are partially processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > opLength - offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the index to increment and the offset to reset when the length is greater than the remaining length of the operation plus one, which could lead to skipping the processing of the last character of an operation.

DONE.
