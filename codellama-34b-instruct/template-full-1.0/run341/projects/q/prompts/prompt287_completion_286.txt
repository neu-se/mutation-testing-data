  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve` is a unary function that resolves the promise, whereas `defer` is an object that contains the promise and various other properties and methods related to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become
```
This would result in different behavior because `become` is a function that handles the "become" method of the deferred object, whereas `defer` is an object that contains the deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a function that creates a new promise, whereas `defer` is an object that contains the deferred object.

DONE.
