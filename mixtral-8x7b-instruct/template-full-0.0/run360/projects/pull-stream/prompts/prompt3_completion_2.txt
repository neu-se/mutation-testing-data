 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'k' of sources
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'sources' has the property 'k' instead of iterating over the keys of the 'sources' object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(sources).includes(k)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the key 'k' exists in the 'sources' object, instead of iterating over the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(sources).includes(k)
