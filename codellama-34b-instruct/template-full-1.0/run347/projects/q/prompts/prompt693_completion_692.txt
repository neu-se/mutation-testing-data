  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `arguments` object is a built-in JavaScript object that contains the values of the function's arguments, while `array_slice(arguments, 1)` returns an array of the function's arguments, but excluding the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` returns an array of the function's arguments, but excluding the first two elements, while the original `arguments` object contains all the function's arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(promises, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises` is an array of promises, while `arguments` is an object that contains the values of the function's arguments.

DONE.
