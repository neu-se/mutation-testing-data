  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a defined value in JavaScript, whereas `args` is a variable that may or may not be defined depending on the code above it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array and it would be a truthy value, whereas `args` is a variable that may or may not be defined depending on the code above it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function(){}` is an anonymous function and it would be a truthy value, whereas `args` is a variable that may or may not be defined depending on the code above it.

DONE.
