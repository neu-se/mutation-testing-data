  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the objects in the `Object.keys()` method, which could potentially cause the `reduce()` method to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a` and `b` together, which could potentially cause the `reduce()` method to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the values of `b` from `a`, which could potentially cause the `reduce()` method to produce a different result.

DONE.
