  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "1" to the key, which would cause the `set` method to store the value under a different key than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + " "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a space to the key, which would cause the `set` method to store the value under a different key than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "1" to the key, which would cause the `set` method to store the value under a different key than expected.

DONE.
