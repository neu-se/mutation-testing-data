  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove one extra character from the word, resulting in a different plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove three extra characters from the word, resulting in a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove four extra characters from the word, resulting in a different plural form.

DONE.
