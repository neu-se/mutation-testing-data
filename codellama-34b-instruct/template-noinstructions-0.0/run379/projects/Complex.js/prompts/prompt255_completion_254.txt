  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a single number, while `a + b` is a sum of two numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a single number, while `a * b` is a product of two numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a single number, while `a / b` is a division of two numbers.

DONE.
