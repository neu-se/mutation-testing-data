  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// wrong code snippet
Math.exp(a) * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `expm1` instead of `exp`, which gives different output for small `a` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// another wrong code snippet
Math.exp(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `cosm1` instead of `cos`, which gives different output for small `b` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// yet another wrong code snippet
Math.log10(a) * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `log` instead of `log10`, which gives different output for large `a` values.

DONE.
