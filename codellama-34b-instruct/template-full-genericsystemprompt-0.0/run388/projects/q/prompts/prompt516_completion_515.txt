  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that handles rejected promises, whereas `then` is a method that handles both fulfilled and rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that handles both fulfilled and rejected promises, whereas `then` is a method that handles only fulfilled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that handles an array of promises, whereas `then` is a method that handles a single promise.

DONE.
