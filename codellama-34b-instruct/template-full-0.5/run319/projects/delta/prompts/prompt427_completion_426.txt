  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it's an object. If `op.retain` is an object, the original code would return 1, while this code would return 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it's equal to 0. If `op.retain` is 0, the original code would return 1, while this code would return 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it's not equal to 0. If
