  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called with `index` equal to `1`, which would insert the new operation at the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 2, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called with `index` equal to `2`, which would insert the new operation at the second position in the `ops` array, rather than at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called with `index` equal to `0`, which would insert the new operation at the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than at the end.

DONE.
