  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset < index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the offset to the index, rather than checking if the offset is less than or equal to the index, which is the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length to the index, rather than checking if the length is less than or equal to the index, which is the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset > index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the offset to the index, rather than checking if the offset is less than or equal to the index, which is the original behavior.

DONE.
