  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)` would return a function that always resolves with `null`, regardless of the actual result of the promise. This would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)` would return a function that always resolves with `undefined`, regardless of the actual result of the promise. This would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {}));
```
This would result
