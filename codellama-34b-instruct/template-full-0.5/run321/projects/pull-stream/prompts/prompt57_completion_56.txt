  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushed the item as is, while this new code fragment pushes the item plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushed the item as is, while this new code fragment pushes the item multiplied by two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item.toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushed the item as is, while this new code fragment pushes the string representation of the item.

DONE.
