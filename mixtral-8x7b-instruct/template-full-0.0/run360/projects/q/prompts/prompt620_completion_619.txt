 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `dispatch` method from the Object prototype, rather than the Promise instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number instead of calling the `dispatch` method, causing the promise to never resolve or reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.get
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `get` method instead of `dispatch`, which would change the behavior of the property access operation.

DONE.
