  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to be called with `null` as the first argument, which would result in a different resolution value for the returned promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would result in a different resolution value for the returned promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to be called with `0` as the first argument, which would result in a different resolution value for the returned promise.

DONE.
