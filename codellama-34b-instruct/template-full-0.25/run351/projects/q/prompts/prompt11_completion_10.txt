  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `definition` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `define`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the argument to `define`, rather than the `definition` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the string `"foo"` as the argument to `define`, rather than the `definition` function.

DONE.
