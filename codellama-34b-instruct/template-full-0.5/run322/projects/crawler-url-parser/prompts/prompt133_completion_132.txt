  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the replacement code fragment uses a backslash. This could cause the code to interpret the path incorrectly and return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the replacement code fragment uses a space. This could cause the code to interpret the path incorrectly and return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the replacement code fragment uses a hash symbol. This could cause the code to interpret the path incorrectly and return incorrect results.

DONE.
