  Thank you for the clarification. Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `!unique`. This would result in different behavior because `!unique` is the negation of `unique`, so if an item is unique, it would be passed through the filter, but if an item is not unique, it would be filtered out.
```
module.exports = function nonUnique (field) {
  return !unique(field, true)
}
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `field.includes(field)`. This would result in different behavior because `includes()` checks if an array contains a specific element, so if an item is not included in the array, it would be passed through the filter, but if an item is included in the array, it would be filtered out.
```
module.exports = function nonUnique (field) {
  return field.includes(field, true)
}
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `field.indexOf(field) !== -
