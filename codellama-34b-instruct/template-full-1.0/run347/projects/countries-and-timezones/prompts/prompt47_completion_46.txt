  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` is incremented by 1, which means that the `getCountry` function would receive a different `id` than the one passed in the original code. This could cause the function to return a different result or even throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, { ...options, deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object passed to the `getCountry` function would have a `deprecated` property set to `true`, which could cause the function to return a different result or even throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"country_" + id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` is prepended with the string "country_", which means that the `getCountry` function would receive a different `id` than the one passed in the original code. This could cause the
