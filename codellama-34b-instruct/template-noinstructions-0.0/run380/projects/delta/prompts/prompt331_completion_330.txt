  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `insert` property of the `baseOp` object is a string, and if so, it is calling the `indexOf` method on that string. If the `insert` property is not a string, the `indexOf` method will not be called, and the code will continue to execute.

However, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `null`, the `indexOf` method will be called on `null`, which will result in a `TypeError` being thrown. This will cause the code to behave differently than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `insert` property of the `baseOp` object is a string, and if so, it is calling the `indexOf` method on that string. If the `insert` property is not a string, the `indexOf` method will not be called, and the code will continue to
