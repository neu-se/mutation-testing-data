  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/chilly/i, 'chillis')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is different than the original, and the output string is also different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is not the same as the original, and it would return a different output for words like "chilly".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('chilly', 'chillies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the word is not the same as the original, and it would return a different output for words like "chilly".

DONE.
