  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(test && true) || id`, which would always return `true` if `test` is truthy, and `id` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(test || false) && id`, which would always return `false` if `test` is falsy, and `id` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(!test) && id`, which would always return `false` if `test` is truthy,
