  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the second key of the `otherData` object instead of the first, which could lead to a different result in the `transform` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0].toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the first key of the `otherData` object to lowercase before comparing it to `embedType`, which could lead to a different result in the `transform` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0].split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the first key of the `otherData` object before comparing it to `embedType`, which could lead to a different result in the `transform` method.

DONE.
