  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function noop() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, whereas `noop` is a reference to the `noop` function, which is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function () {}` is an anonymous function that does nothing, whereas `noop` is a reference to the `noop` function, which is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `function () { return undefined; }` is an anonymous function that returns `undefined`, whereas `noop` is a reference to the `noop` function, which is not defined in the code snippet.

DONE.
