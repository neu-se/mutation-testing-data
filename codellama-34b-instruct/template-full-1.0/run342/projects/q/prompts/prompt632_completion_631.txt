  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator changes the key value being passed to the `get` method, potentially causing a different value to be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator changes the key value being passed to the `get` method, potentially causing a different value to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key is now a string, which could cause the `get` method to throw an error if it is expecting a numeric key.

DONE.
