  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `URL.parse()` method which is case-sensitive, while the modified code uses the `toLowerCase()` method to convert the URL string to lowercase before parsing it. This could cause the parser to interpret the URL differently, leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the entire URL string, while the modified code only parses the first part of the URL string (i.e. the protocol and hostname) by splitting it at the `/` character and taking the first part. This could cause the parser to interpret the URL differently, leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different
