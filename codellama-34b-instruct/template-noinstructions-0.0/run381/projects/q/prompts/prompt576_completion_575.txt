  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with the `throw` verb, which would cause the generator to throw an exception instead of returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with the `next` verb, which would cause the generator to return the next value in the sequence instead of throwing an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "return")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with the `return` verb, which would cause the generator to return a value instead of throwing an exception.

DONE.
