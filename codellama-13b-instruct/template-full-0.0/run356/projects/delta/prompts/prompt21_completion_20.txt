  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isEqual` function is not called, and the comparison is done using the `!=` operator instead. This could potentially cause the test to fail if the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]` are not equal, even if they are logically equivalent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key] && a[key] !== undefined
```
