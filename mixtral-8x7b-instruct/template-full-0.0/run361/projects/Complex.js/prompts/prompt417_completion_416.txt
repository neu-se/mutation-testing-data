 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for explicit equality of the real and imaginary parts to zero, instead of invoking the `isZero` method which might contain additional checks or logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(this).length === 0
