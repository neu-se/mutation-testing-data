  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/g, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which will match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, instead of just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which will ignore the case of the input string, so the pattern will match both uppercase and lowercase versions of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
