  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\.\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match paths that end with a dot, which is not allowed by the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\.\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match paths that end with a dot and a forward slash, which is not allowed by the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\.\/+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match paths that end with a dot and one or more forward slashes, which is not allowed by the original code fragment.

DONE.
