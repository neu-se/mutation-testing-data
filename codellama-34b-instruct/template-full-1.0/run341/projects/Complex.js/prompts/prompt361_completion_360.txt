  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` and `sinh` are different trigonometric functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `sinh` are different trigonometric functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan` and `sinh` are different trigonometric functions.

DONE.
