  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this new code checks if `_b` is equal to 0. Since `_b` is a different variable, this change would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `b` is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this new code checks if `b` is truthy. Since `b` is a number, it will always be truthy, so this change would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `b` is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this new code checks if `b` is not equal to
