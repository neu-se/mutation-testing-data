  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` character as the search pattern for the `replace` method, while this code fragment uses the `e` character. This would cause the pluralization of the word "man" to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `i` flag to make the regular expression case-insensitive, while this code fragment does not. This would cause the pluralization of the word "Man" to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/,
