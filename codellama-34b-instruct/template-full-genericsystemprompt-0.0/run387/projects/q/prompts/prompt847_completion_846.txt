  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` is a resolved promise, while `Q(object)` is a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` is a resolved promise, while `Q(object)` is a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(0)` is a resolved promise, while `Q(object)` is a rejected promise.

DONE.
