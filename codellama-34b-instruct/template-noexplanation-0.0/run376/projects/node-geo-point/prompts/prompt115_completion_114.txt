  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the longitude instead of the latitude. This could potentially cause issues with the calculation of the tile coordinates, as the longitude is not used in the same way as the latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + 1
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds 1 to the result of the calculation. This could potentially cause issues with the calculation of the tile coordinates, as the result of the calculation is no longer in the range of -180 to 180 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 * 2
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it multiplies the result of the calculation by 2. This could potentially cause issues with the calculation of the tile
