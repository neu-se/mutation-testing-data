  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Promise rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called with a new `Error` object, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(new Error("Promise resolved"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with a new `Error` object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with that error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(new Error("Promise settled"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function is called with a new `Error` object, which would cause the promise to be settled with that error.

DONE.
