  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves when the original promise is resolved, but it would not propagate the rejection of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves when the original promise is resolved, but it would also catch any errors that occur during the resolution of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves when the original promise is resolved, but it would also execute the specified function when the original promise is resolved or rejected.

DONE.
