  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.contains
```
This would result in different behavior because `contains` returns `true` if the first argument contains the second argument, whereas `split` returns an array of substrings between the specified separation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` returns the modified string after replacing matches in the string, whereas `split` returns an array of substrings between the specified separation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a specified portion of the string, whereas `split` returns an array of substrings between the specified separation.

DONE.
