  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to always push the new op to the end of the `ops` array, regardless of the length of the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to always push the new op to the beginning of the `ops` array, regardless of the length of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to always push the new op to the middle of the `ops` array, regardless of the length of the `ops` array.

DONE.
