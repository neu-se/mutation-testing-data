  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a function, and `object.inspect()` is a function call that returns an object with information about the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.state` is a property that contains the promise's state, but it is not a function call that returns an object with information about the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.value` is a property that contains the promise's fulfillment value, but it is not a function call that returns an object with information about the promise's state.

DONE.
