  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, [cbs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the square brackets around `cbs` would create a new array with `cbs` as its only element, rather than passing `cbs` as a single argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the value of `cbs`, rather than passing `cbs` as a single argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `cbs` array as a single argument, rather than passing the `cbs` array itself.

DONE.
