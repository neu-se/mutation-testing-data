 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.apply([], promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `concat` and the spread operator to flatten the array, which may change the original structure of the `promises` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `promises` array, which may not have the same reference as the original array, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the original array reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.map(identity)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `map` function to create a new array, and the `identity` function to return the original elements, which may cause issues if the code relies on the original array's mutation.

DONE.
