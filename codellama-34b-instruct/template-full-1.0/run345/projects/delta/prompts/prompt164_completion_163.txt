  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisIter.peek() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method returns an `Op` object, which will have a `delete` property if it is a deletion operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current iteration, which would be 0 for a deletion operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() && thisIter.next() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method checks if there is a next iteration, and the `next()` method returns the next `Op` object, which will be a deletion operation if it exists.

DONE.
