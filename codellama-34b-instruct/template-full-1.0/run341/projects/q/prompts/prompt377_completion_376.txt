  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a statement that returns `undefined`, whereas `newValue` is a variable that could contain any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that represents the absence of an object, whereas `newValue` could be any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string is a valid value that would be passed to the `deferred.notify()` method, whereas `newValue` could be any value.

DONE.
