  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is used to extract a subset of elements from an array, but the `reverse` method reverses the order of the elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(["foo"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is used to extract a subset of elements from an array, but the `concat` method adds new elements to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x !== "foo"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is used to extract a subset of elements from an array, but the `filter` method removes elements from the array based on a condition.

DONE.
