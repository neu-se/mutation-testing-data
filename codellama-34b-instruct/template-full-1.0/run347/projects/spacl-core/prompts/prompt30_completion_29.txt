  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => acc + seg
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the segments in reverse order, which could produce unexpected results if the segments contain certain characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => acc + seg.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the length of each segment to the accumulator, rather than the segment itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => ' ' + acc + ' ' + seg
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add spaces between the segments, which could affect the final url.

DONE.
