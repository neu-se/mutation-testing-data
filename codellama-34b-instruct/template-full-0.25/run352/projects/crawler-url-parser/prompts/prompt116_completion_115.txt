  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is not defined for the `Map` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method removes all elements from the `Map` object, whereas the `delete` method only removes the element with the specified key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.remove(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `remove` method is not defined for the `Map` object, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
