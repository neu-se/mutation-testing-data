  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments in a different order, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, args, op
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments in a different order, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, op, object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments in a different order, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
