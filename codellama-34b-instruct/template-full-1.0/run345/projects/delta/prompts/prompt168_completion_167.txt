  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next().delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` operation to be applied to the next operation in the iterator, instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` operation to be applied to the next operation in the other iterator, instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` operation to be applied to the first operation in the other iterator, instead of the current one.

DONE.
