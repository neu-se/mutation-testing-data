  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.length == pageurl_path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the number of path parts, while this code fragment checks for the length of the path strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.length == pageurl_parts.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the number of path parts, while this code fragment checks for the number of parts in the `linkurl_parts` and `pageurl_parts` arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").length == pageurl_path.split("/").length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the number of path parts, while this code fragment checks for the number of parts in the array returned by the `split` method.

DONE.
