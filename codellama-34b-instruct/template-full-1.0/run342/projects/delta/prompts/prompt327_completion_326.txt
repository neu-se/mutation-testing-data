  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete();
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `delete()` after pushing a value to the `inverted` array would remove the pushed value from the array, which may not be the desired outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `shift()` after pushing a value to the `inverted` array would remove the first value from the array, which may not be the desired outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `pop()` after pushing a value to the `inverted` array would remove the last value from the array, which may not be the desired outcome.

DONE.
