  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object instead of the country object, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options).timezones }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country's timezones instead of the country object, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options).allTimezones }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country's allTimezones property instead of the country object, which is not what the function is intended to do.

DONE.
