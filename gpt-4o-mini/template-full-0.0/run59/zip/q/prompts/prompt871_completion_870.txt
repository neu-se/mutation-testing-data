Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `args` would cause the `nfapply` method to be called without any arguments, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior when the Node-style function expects arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `args` would also lead to the `nfapply` method being called without any arguments, similar to the first option, but it may behave differently depending on how the Node-style function handles `undefined` inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty array instead of `args` would mean that the Node-style function is called with no arguments, which could lead to different execution paths or errors if the function expects at least one argument.

DONE.
