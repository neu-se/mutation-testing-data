  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` would be created with a different port number, which could affect the timing of the message delivery.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the message payload would be a string instead of a number, which could affect the behavior of the `MessageChannel` implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the message payload would be `null` instead of a number, which could affect the behavior of the `MessageChannel` implementation.

DONE.
