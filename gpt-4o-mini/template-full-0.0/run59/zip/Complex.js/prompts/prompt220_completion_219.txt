Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the cosine of `b` instead of the sine, leading to incorrect imaginary parts of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the tangent of `b`, which can produce significantly different values, especially for angles near odd multiples of Ï€/2, resulting in incorrect imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `b` instead of computing the sine, leading to an incorrect imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
