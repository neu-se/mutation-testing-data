  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello World!");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply logs the value of the `console` object to the console, while the new code fragment logs the string "Hello World!" to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(1 + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the value of the `console` object to the console, while the new code fragment logs the result of the expression `1 + 1` to the console.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(console.log);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the value of the `console` object to the console, while the new code fragment logs the value of the `console.log` function to the console.

DONE.
