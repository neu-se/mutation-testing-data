  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fbind` would return a function that always returns a rejected promise with value `null`, whereas the original code would return a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the `object` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fbind` would return a function that always returns a rejected promise with value `undefined`, whereas the original code would return a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the `object` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fbind` would return a function that always returns a rejected promise with value `this`, whereas the original code would return a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the `object` parameter.

DONE.
