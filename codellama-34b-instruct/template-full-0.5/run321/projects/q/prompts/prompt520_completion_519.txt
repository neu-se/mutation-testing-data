  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes a comma operator, which evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand. In this case, the value of the last operand is `deferred.notify`, which is a function. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with this code fragment would cause the `reject` and `notify` functions to be called with `deferred.resolve` as the argument, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.reject), deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes a function call to `deferred.resolve`, which is not present in this code fragment. This code fragment would cause the `reject` and `notify` functions to be called with the result of `deferred.resolve(deferred.reject)`
