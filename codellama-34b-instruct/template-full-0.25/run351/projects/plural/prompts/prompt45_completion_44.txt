  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches a different set of words than the original code fragment. The original code fragment matches words that end with "o" and are not preceded by a vowel, while the new code fragment matches words that end with "o" and are preceded by a vowel.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches a different set of words than the original code fragment. The original code fragment matches words that end with "o" and are preceded by a consonant, while the new code fragment matches words that end with "o" and are not preceded by a vowel.
