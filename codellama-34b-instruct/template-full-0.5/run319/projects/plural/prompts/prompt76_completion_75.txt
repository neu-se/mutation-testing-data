  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which would result in the plural form of the word "dice" being returned, while the new code fragment would return the plural form of the word "die".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which would result in the plural form of the word "dice" being returned, while the new code fragment would return the plural form of the word "die" with an additional "s" at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'die'`, which would return the plural form of the word "die", while the new code fragment would return the plural form of the word "dice".

DONE.
