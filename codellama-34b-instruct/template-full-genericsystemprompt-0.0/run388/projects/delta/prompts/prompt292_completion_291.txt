  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is greater than 0, while this replacement checks if the index is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is greater than 0, while this replacement checks if the index is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is greater than 0, while this replacement checks if the index is not equal to 0.

DONE.
