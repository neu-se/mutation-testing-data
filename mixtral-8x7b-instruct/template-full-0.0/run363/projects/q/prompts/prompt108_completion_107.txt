 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the `i` variable instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to iterate over the same elements multiple times or not at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces non-determinism to the loop, potentially causing it to skip elements or iterate over them multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
array_indexOf(value, this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `value` is equal to the current `this` value, rather than checking if the `value` is equal to the current array element.

DONE.
