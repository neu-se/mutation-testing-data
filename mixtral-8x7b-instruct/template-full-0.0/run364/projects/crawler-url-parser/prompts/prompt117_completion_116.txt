 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => gettype
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a function that returns the `gettype` function, instead of directly calling `gettype`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
gettype.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a bound version of the `gettype` function, changing its `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor(gettype)
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies the `Math.floor` function to the `gettype` function, which will always return `NaN` since `gettype` is not a number.

DONE.
