  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be replaced with the `set` method, which would cause the promise to resolve with the value of the property instead of the property itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be replaced with the `delete` method, which would cause the promise to resolve with `undefined` instead of the property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be replaced with the `post` method, which would cause the promise to resolve with the value of the property instead of the property itself, but would also cause the property to be set to the value of the `args` parameter.

DONE.
