  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would be compared to the `promise` object, rather than the `promise` object being checked for inclusion in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method would be used to check if the `promise` object is included in the `reported
