  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitudee'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would refer to a property called "longitudee" instead of "longitude", which may not exist in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'rongitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would refer to a property called "rongitude" instead of "longitude", which may not exist in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1234
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would coerce the property value to a number, which may not be the same as the original behavior of leaving the property value as a string.

DONE.
