  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, which would produce a different output than `sin`, which is the sine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is the tangent function, which would produce a different output than `sin`, which is the sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse cosine function, which would produce a different output than `sin`, which is the sine function.

DONE.
