  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is a different iterator, and `peekType` would return the type of the next operation in the other iterator, which may not be the same as the type of the next operation in `thisIter`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` is a method that returns the type of the next operation, and adding `()` would call the method and return the type of the next operation.

DONE.
