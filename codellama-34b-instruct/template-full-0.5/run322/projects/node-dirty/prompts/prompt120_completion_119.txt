  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to zero, while this modified code fragment checks if it is strictly less than zero. If there are no in-flight writes, this modified code fragment will enter the `if` block and emit a `'drain'` event, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to zero, while this modified code fragment checks if it is equal to zero. If there are no in-flight writes, this modified code fragment will enter the `if` block and emit a `'drain'` event, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
