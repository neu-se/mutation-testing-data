  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function call, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function call, while `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of any defined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function call, while `throw new Error('aborted')` is an exception that will be thrown if the `abort` function is called.

DONE.
