  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` function returns an array of matches, which is likely not what the developer intended to use in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.search
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` function returns the index of the first match, which may not be the same as the index of the match returned by the `match` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` function returns a copy of the string with the match replaced with the specified replacement string, which may not be what the developer intended to use in this context.

DONE.
