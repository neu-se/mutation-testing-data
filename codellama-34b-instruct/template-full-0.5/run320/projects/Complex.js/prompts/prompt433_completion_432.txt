  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the result of the multiplication to be negative, even if the original value was positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the result of the multiplication would cause the value to be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the value to be twice as large as the original.

DONE.
