  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `array_reduce` returns the result of applying a function to each element of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map(function(x) { return x + 1; }, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` returns a new array with the results of calling a function on each element of the original array, whereas `array_reduce` returns the result of applying a function to each element of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter(function(x) { return x % 2 === 0; }, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` returns a new array with the elements that pass a test implemented by a provided function, whereas `array_reduce` returns the result of
