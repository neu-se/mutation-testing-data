  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code performs a shallow copy of the `prev` object, while the mutated code performs a concatenation of the `prev` object and the `tzs[key]` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not access the `prev` object at all, while the mutated code accesses the `prev` object at the `key` property, which may or may not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code performs a shallow copy of the `prev` object, while the mutated code performs a shallow copy of the `prev` object and the `tzs[key]` object. However, the mutated code does not perform a concatenation, which may change the behavior of the code.
