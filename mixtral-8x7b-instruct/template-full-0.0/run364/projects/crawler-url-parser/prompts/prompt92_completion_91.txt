 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a string, even if `href` is undefined or null, unlike the original code which skips further processing if `href` is undefined or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
href || ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use an empty string as the value of `href` if it is falsy (undefined, null, 0, false, or an empty string), unlike the original code which skips further processing if `href` is undefined or null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(href || '').replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any semicolon and following characters from the end of the `href` string, even if `href` is undefined or null, unlike the original code which skips further processing if `href` is
