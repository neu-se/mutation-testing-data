  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries[id]` is now null, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return null instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries[id]` is now undefined, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return undefined instead of the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries[id]` is now an empty object, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return an empty object instead of the expected country object.

DONE.
