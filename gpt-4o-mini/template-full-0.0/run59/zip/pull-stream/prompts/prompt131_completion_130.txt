Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` by 2 instead of 1, which could cause the function to exceed `max` more quickly, potentially leading to different results in the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements `i` instead of incrementing it, which could cause the function to never exceed `max`, leading to an infinite loop or unexpected results in the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = max
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `i` to the value of `max` directly, which could cause the function to immediately trigger the condition `i > max` if `max` is not `Infinity`, leading to an early termination of the callback.

DONE.
