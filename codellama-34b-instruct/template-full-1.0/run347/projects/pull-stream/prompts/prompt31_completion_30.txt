  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[2], ref[3], ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the arguments passed to the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1], ref[2], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument passed to the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[2], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it leaves out the second argument passed to the `pull` function.

DONE.
