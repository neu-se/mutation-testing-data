Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly increases the length by 1, potentially causing the loop to iterate one extra time and leading to unexpected results in the composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decreases the length by 1, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely, resulting in missing operations that should have been included in the composed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the other iterator instead of the current iterator, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations and an invalid composition of deltas.

DONE.
