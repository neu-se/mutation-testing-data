  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `dispatch` with `args` as the first argument, rather than `void 0` and `args` as the first two arguments, as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [promise, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `dispatch` with `promise` as the first argument, rather than `void 0` and `args` as the first two arguments, as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `dispatch` with `this` as the first argument, rather than `void 0` and `args` as the first two arguments, as intended.

DONE.
