  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to `null` instead of the `policy` object, which could cause errors if the map is used later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to `undefined` instead of the `policy` object, which could cause errors if the map is used later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to an empty object instead of the `policy` object, which could cause errors if the map is used later in the code.

DONE.
