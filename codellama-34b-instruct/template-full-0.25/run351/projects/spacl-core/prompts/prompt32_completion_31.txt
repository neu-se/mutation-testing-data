  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string would be used as the separator instead of the dollar sign, which would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash would be used as the separator instead of the dollar sign, which would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, '.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the dot would be used as the separator instead of the dollar sign, which would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

DONE.
