Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are numbers instead of strings, which would cause the merging logic to be skipped if the insert values are strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'string' ||
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical OR operator instead of AND, meaning that if either `newOp.insert` or `lastOp.insert` is a string, the merging logic would execute, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when both are strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert === lastOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality between the two insert values instead of their types, which could lead to merging operations even when the values are of different types or not both strings.

DONE.
