 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` resolves when all promises are fulfilled, while `Q.allResolved` waits for all promises to be settled, regardless of their fulfillment or rejection status.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return []; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an empty array, disregarding the input promises, while the original code waits for all promises to be resolved or rejected before returning an array of their states.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` immediately resolves the returned promise with an empty array, while the original code waits for all input promises to settle before returning an array of their states.

DONE.
