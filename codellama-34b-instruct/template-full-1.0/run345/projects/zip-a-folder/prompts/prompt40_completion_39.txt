  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split()
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the `src` string into an array, whereas the original code fragment `src.split` does not split the string and instead returns a new string with the characters in the separator removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.replace('', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all occurrences of the empty string in `src` with the empty string, whereas the original code fragment `src.split` does not modify the string at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a new string with the first character of `src` removed, whereas the original code fragment `src.split` does not modify the string at all.

DONE.
