  Sure, I can suggest three different code fragments to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the drain function with different behavior. Here are the three options:

Option 1:
```
abort || false, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the abort() function would be called with `false` as its argument, which would not match the behavior of the original code where `abort()` was called with `true` as its argument.

Option 2:
```
abort || true, done || function () { throw new Error('done is not a function') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the throw expression would cause the program to fail with an error when `done()` is not a function, whereas the original code would simply log a warning message to the console.

Option 3:
```
abort || true, done || function () { console.log('done is not a function') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the console.log() statement would log a message to the console when `done()` is not a function, whereas the original code would simply log a warning message to
