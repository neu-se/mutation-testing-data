  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the attributes object, which may not be the same as the length of the op itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.keys().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of keys in the attributes object, which may not be the same as the length of the op itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.values().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of values in the attributes object, which may not be the same as the length of the op itself.

DONE.
