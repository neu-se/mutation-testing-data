  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments.length` is equal to 1, while this replacement checks if it is less than 1. This would cause the `basis` variable to be set to `undefined` if the `arguments.length` is 0, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `reduce` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments.length` is equal to 1, while this replacement checks if it is greater than 1. This would cause the `basis` variable to be set to the first element of the `arguments` array if the `arguments.length` is greater than 1, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `reduce` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 0
```
This would
