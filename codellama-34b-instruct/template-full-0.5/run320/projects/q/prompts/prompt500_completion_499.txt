  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` prototype in JavaScript, and they have different behaviors when it comes to handling arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that, when called, will have its `this` set to the first argument passed to `bind`, and will use the arguments passed to `bind` as the first arguments to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` returns a string representation of the function, and it is not equivalent to calling the function with the given arguments.

DONE.
