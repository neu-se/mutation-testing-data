  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, potentially returning a different slice of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be passed as a whole, rather than a slice of it, potentially causing the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a different value than `arguments`, potentially causing the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

DONE.
