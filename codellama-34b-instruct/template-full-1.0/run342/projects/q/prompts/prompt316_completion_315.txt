  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` variable is set to a function in the provided code, so the `inspect !== void 0` condition would always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof inspect !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` variable is set to a function in the provided code, so the `typeof inspect !== "function"` condition would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.isPrototypeOf(inspect)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` variable is not a promise in the provided code, so the `Promise.prototype.isPrototypeOf(inspect)` condition would always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
