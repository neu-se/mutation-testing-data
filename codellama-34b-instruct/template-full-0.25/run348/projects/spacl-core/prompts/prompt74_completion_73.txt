  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because `res !== false` is always true when `res` is `null`, which is the default value returned by `rule.query()` when the combination of path and action is not governed by the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `res === true` is always false when `res` is `null`, which is the default value returned by `rule.query()` when the combination of path and action is not governed by the policy.
