  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes that `data` is a non-null object, while `null` is a null object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes that `data` is a defined variable, while `undefined` is an undefined variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes that `data` is an object with properties, while `{}` is an empty object with no properties.

DONE.
