  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, while `Math.exp()` returns the exponential of a given number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt()` returns the principal square root of a number, while `Math.exp()` returns the exponential of a given number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log()` returns the natural logarithm of a number, while `Math.exp()` returns the exponential of a given number.

DONE.
