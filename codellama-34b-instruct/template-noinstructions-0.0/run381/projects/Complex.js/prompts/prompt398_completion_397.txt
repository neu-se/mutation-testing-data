  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(
        sinh(a) / d,
        Math.sin(b) / d);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.sin(b)` instead of `Math.cos(b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(
        sinh(a) / d,
        -Math.sin(b) / d);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.sin(b)` instead of `-Math.sin(b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(
        sinh(a) / d,
        Math.cos(b) / d);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.sin(b)` instead of `Math.cos(b)`.

DONE.
