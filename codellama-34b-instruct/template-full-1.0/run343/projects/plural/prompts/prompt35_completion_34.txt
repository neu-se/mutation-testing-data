  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring starting position would be zero, resulting in an empty string being returned instead of a substring of the original word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring starting position would be two characters past the end of the word, resulting in an out-of-bounds error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring starting position would be NaN, resulting in an error.

DONE.
