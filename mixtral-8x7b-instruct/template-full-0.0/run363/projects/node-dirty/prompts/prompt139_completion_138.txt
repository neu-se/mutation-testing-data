 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length > 0 || err === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the condition, making the error event not emitted when there are callbacks and the error is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0 && err === undefined
