  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always enable gzip compression, even if the `archiverOptions` object does not specify it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { store: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always enable the "store" compression method, even if the `archiverOptions` object specifies a different method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { gzip: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always disable gzip compression, even if the `archiverOptions` object specifies it.

DONE.
