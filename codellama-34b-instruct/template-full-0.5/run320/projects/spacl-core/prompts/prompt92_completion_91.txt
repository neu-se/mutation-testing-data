  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the array, causing the loop to iterate over the policies in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.filter(p => p.name !== 'default'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array containing only the policies that match the specified condition. In this case, it would return an array of policies that do not have the name 'default'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array containing a subset of the original array, starting from the specified index. In this case, it would return an array of policies starting from the second policy.

DONE.
