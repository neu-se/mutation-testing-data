  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `nfapply` method, instead of passing all the arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value as the first argument to the `nfapply` method, instead of passing the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an undefined value as the first argument to the `nfapply` method, instead of passing the `args` array.

DONE.
