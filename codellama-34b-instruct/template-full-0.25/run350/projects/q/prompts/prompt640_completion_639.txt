  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
