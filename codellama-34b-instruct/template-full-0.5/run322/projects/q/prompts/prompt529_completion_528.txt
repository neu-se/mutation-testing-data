  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would always return `null`, even if the object is not resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would always return `undefined`, even if the object is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would always return `false`, even if the object is resolved.

DONE.
