  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the trailing slash from the URL, which could cause the code to misinterpret the URL as a directory rather than a file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the slash character, which would cause the regular expression to match a different part of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "a"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the trailing slash with the letter "a", which would cause the code to misinterpret the URL as a file rather than a directory.

DONE.
