  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds one to the length of the next operation, which could cause the while loop to terminate one iteration too early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts one from the length of the next operation, which could cause the while loop to terminate one iteration too late.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next())
+ thisIter.next().delete + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds one to the length of the next operation only if it is a delete operation, which could cause the while loop to terminate too early or too late.

DONE.
