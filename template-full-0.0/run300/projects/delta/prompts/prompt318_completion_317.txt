  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is a number, but the new code fragment checks if it is a string. This could cause the `invert` method to behave differently when it encounters a retain operation with a string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is a number or an object, but the new code fragment checks if it is null. This could cause the `invert` method to behave differently when it encounters a retain operation with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is a number or an object, but the new
