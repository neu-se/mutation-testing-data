  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resetUnhandledRejections` function, which would reset the `unhandledReasons` and `unhandledRejections` arrays, potentially changing the behavior of the code that uses them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly set the `length` property of the `unhandledReasons` array to 0, potentially changing the behavior of the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly set the `length` property of the `unhandledRejections` array to 0, potentially changing the behavior of the code that uses it.

DONE.
