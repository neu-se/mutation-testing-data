  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y).join
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(x).join` is a method that returns a promise that fulfills with the value of `x` if it is a promise, or `x` itself if it is not a promise. In contrast, `Q(y).join` is a method that returns a promise that fulfills with the value of `y` if it is a promise, or `y` itself if it is not a promise. If `x` and `y` are different values, then `Q(x).join` and `Q(y).join` will have different behavior.
