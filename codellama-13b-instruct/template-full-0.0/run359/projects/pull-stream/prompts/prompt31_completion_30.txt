  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `ref[3]` would be passed to the `pull` function, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `ref[4]` would be passed to the `pull` function, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[5]
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `ref[5]` would be passed to the `pull` function, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
