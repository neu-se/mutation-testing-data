  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a new promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is already resolved with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a new promise that is rejected with the given reason, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is already resolved with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([<PLACEHOLDER>])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` returns a new promise that is resolved when all of the given promises have been resolved, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is already resolved with the given value.

DONE.
