 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `mapper` is explicitly set to `null`, whereas the original code checks if `mapper` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.valueOf() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value of `mapper` is equal to `0`, whereas the original code checks if `mapper` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `mapper` constructor's name is an empty string, whereas the original code checks if `mapper` is falsy.

Note that these mutations are not necessarily indicative of bugs in the code, but rather they are designed to test the effectiveness of the test suite by introducing changes that may cause the code to behave differently. DONE.
