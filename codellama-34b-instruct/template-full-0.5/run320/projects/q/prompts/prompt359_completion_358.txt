  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was returning the value as is, while this new code fragment is returning the value plus one, which would cause the test to fail if it was expecting the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was returning the value as is, while this new code fragment is returning the value minus one, which would cause the test to fail if it was expecting the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was returning the value as is, while this new code fragment is returning the value multiplied by two, which would cause the test to fail if it was expecting the original value.

DONE.
