  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially accessing an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, and the code that is supposed to be executed inside the loop would not be reached.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, and the code that is supposed to be executed inside the loop would not be reached.

DONE.
