Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof x !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the input array `x` is not an object, rather than checking if the initial sum is a number, which could lead to incorrect results if the input is not a valid array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the input array has only one element, and returns NaN in that case, whereas the original code would correctly calculate the sum for an array with one element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sum === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the initial sum is equal to zero, and returns NaN in that case, whereas the original code would continue calculating the sum even if the initial value is zero.

DONE.
