  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the next operation in the other iterator to be skipped, potentially leading to a different outcome in the composition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the next operation in the this iterator to be skipped, potentially leading to a different outcome in the composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(Infinity);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the entire remaining sequence of operations in the other iterator to be skipped, potentially leading to a different outcome in the composition.

DONE.
