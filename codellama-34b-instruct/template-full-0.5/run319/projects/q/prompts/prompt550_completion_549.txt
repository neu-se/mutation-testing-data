  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the value of the yield expression, instead of resolving it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value of the yield expression, instead of rejecting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(result.value, callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback or errback function with the value of the yield expression, instead of returning a promise for the result of the generator.

DONE.
