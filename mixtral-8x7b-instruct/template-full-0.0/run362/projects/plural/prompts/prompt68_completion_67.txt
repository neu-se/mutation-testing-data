 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'memos' for the input 'memo', but this change would return 'memo' for any input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'me'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'memos' for the input 'memo', but this change would return 'me' for the input 'memo'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'a' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'memos' for the input 'memo', but this change would return 'memoa' for the input 'memo'.

DONE.
