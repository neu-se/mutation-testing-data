  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is used to send a message to an object, while the `send` method is used to invoke a method on an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is used to send a message to an object, while the `get` method is used to retrieve a property from an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is used to send a message to an object, while the `set` method is used to set a property on an object.

DONE.
