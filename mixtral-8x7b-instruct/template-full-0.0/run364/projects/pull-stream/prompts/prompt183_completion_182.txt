 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the last element in the array from being returned, as the loop would stop one iteration early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.hasOwnProperty(i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return elements that are the direct properties of the array object, and not elements that are inherited from its prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1 in array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index after the current one is present in the array, rather than checking if the current index is within the bounds of the array.

DONE.
