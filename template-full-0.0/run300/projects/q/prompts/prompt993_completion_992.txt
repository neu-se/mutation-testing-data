  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but `defer(null)` would return a deferred object that is already resolved with the value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but `defer(undefined)` would return a deferred object that is already resolved with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but `defer(new Error())` would return a deferred object that is already rejected with an error.

DONE.
