  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the complex number by 2, rather than the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (b - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the difference between the real and imaginary parts of the complex number by 2, rather than the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (b + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number by 2, rather than the imaginary part.

DONE.
