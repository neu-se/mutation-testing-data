  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection()` function would not be called for the first element in the `unhandledRejections` array, which could cause the unhandled rejections to not be tracked correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection()` function would be called for all elements in the `unhandledRejections` array, including the first element, which could cause the unhandled rejections to be tracked incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at !== unhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection()` function would not be called for the last element in the `unhandledRejections` array, which could cause the unhandled rejections to not be tracked correctly.

DONE.
