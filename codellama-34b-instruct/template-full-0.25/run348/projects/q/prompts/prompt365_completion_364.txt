  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `done`, so the `if` statement would be entered even if `done` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the `if` statement would only be entered if `done` is both truthy and strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks for both truthiness and strict equality, so the `if` statement would only be entered if `done` is both truthy and strictly equal to `true`.

DONE.
