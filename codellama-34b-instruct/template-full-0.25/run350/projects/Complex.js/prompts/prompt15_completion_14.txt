  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of x, while the replaced code fragment calculates the cosine of x + 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of x, while the replaced code fragment calculates the cosine of x - 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of x, while the replaced code fragment calculates the cosine of 2x.

DONE.
