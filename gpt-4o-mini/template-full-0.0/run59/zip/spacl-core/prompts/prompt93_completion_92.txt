Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.delete(policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of adding the policy to the collection, it would remove any existing policy with the same name, potentially leading to a loss of data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the policy's value to `null`, effectively removing the policy's functionality and causing queries to return `null` for that policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, { ...policy, active: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the policy with an altered state (setting `active` to `false`), which may cause the `query` and `matches` methods to behave incorrectly if they rely on the `active` property being `true`.

DONE.
