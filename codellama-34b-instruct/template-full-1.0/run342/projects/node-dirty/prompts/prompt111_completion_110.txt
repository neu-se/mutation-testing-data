  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the beginning of the db: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would indicate that the corrupted data is at the beginning of the database instead of the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row in the middle of the db: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would indicate that the corrupted data is somewhere in the middle of the database instead of at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.split('').reverse().join('')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would indicate that the corrupted data is at the end of the database, but the data would be displayed in reverse order.

DONE.
