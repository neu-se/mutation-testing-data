  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.filter(verb => verb !== 'GET')
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out the 'GET' verb, which is a valid verb in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.map(verb => verb.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts all verbs to uppercase, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first verb from the array, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
