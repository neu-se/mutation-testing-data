  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a').attr('href');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` attribute of the link within the current element, rather than the `href` attribute of the current element itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).parent().attr('href');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` attribute of the parent element of the current element, rather than the `href` attribute of the current element itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).siblings('a').attr('href');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` attribute of the sibling link of the current element, rather than the `href` attribute of the current element itself.

DONE.
