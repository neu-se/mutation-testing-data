  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `tzs` object at the given key, while this modified code fragment returns the value plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `tzs` object at the given key, while this modified code fragment returns the value minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `tzs` object at the given key, while this modified code fragment returns the value multiplied by 2.

DONE.
