  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for the letter "j" or "J" instead of "i" or "I".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking only for the capital letter "I" instead of both "i" and "I".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'i' && c === 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for both "i" and "I" at the same time, which would always return false.

DONE.
