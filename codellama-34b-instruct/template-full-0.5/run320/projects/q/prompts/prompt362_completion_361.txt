  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with an exception instead of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified of progress instead of being resolved.

DONE.
