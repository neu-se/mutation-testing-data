  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a non-promise value, and it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to throw a `TypeError` when it is used as the `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a non-promise value, and it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to throw a `TypeError` when it is used as the `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a non-promise value, and it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to throw a `TypeError` when it is used as the `this` value.

DONE.
