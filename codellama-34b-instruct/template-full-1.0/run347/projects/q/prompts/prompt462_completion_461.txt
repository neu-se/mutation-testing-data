  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_lastIndexOf()` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified item in the array, whereas `array_indexOf()` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_findIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_findIndex()` returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function, whereas `array_indexOf()` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified item.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.findIndex.call(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function, whereas `array_indexOf()` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified item.

DONE.
