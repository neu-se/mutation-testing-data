  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, {
  encoding: 'utf8'
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is now set to `'utf8'` instead of whatever was passed in the `options` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, {
  flag: 'wx'
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flag` option is now set to `'wx'` instead of whatever was passed in the `options` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, {
  mode: 0o666
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` option is now set to `0o666` instead of whatever was passed in the `options` argument.

DONE.
