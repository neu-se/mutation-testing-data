  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` is a function that returns the next value in the iteration, while `otherIter.next()` is a function call that executes the next function in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(1)` is a function call that executes the next function in the iteration with an argument of 1, while `otherIter.next` is a function that returns the next value in the iteration without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.previous` is a function that returns the previous value in the iteration, while `otherIter.next` is a function that returns the next value in the iteration.

DONE.
