  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is an object, and `thisOp.retain.length` would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is an object, and `otherOp.retain.length` would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta` is an object, and `delta.length` would return `undefined`.

DONE.
