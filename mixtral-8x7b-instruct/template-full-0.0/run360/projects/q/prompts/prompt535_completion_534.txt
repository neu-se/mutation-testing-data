 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { throw new Error('Buggy replacement'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error instead of using the provided `fulfilled` and `rejected` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an array instead of two functions, causing the `spread` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes the `fulfilled` function, omitting the `rejected` function, which might cause issues if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
