  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[result, match]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the function to use the wrong argument as the match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be adding 1 to the result instead of the match, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be multiplying the result by 2 instead of using the match, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
