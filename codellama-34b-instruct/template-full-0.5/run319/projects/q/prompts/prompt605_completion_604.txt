  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve.call(self, op, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that takes a single argument, but `op` and `args` are two separate arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(op, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that takes a single argument, but `op` and `args` are two separate arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that takes a single argument, but `args` is an array of arguments.

DONE.
