 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` function would not properly handle the `retain` operation with attribute objects, as the `AttributeMap.invert` method expects a non-null value for the `op.attributes` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` function would not properly handle the `retain` operation with attribute objects, as the `AttributeMap.invert` method expects an object with the same keys as the original `op.attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['notAnAttribute']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` function would not properly handle the `retain` operation with attribute objects, as the `AttributeMap.invert` method expects an object with the same keys as the original `op.attributes` object, but it receives an array instead.
