  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the callback argument to `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which is not a function and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would return `undefined` instead of a promise, which would cause the promise chain to resolve with `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(() => { throw new Error("Testing"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would throw an error instead of returning a promise, which would cause the promise chain to reject with the error instead of the expected value.

DONE.
