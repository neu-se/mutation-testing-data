Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be called with a lowercase version of the pattern, potentially changing the result if the original pattern contained uppercase characters that are significant in glob patterns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be called with a pattern that has an additional trailing slash, which could affect the glob matching behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern.replace(GLOBSTAR, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be called with a pattern that has all occurrences of `**` removed, potentially changing the result if the original pattern relied on the `**` wildcard for matching.

DONE.
