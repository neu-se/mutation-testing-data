  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the exclamation mark negates the result of the test function, so if the test function returns true, the if statement would not be executed, even if the test function returned true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would run the test function twice, even if the first run returned true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only run the test function once, but if the first run returned true, the if statement would still be executed.

DONE.
