  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to the `set` method is now `1`, which is not a function. This would cause the `set` method to throw an error when it tries to call the third argument as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to the `set` method is now `undefined`, which is not a function. This would cause the `set` method to throw an error when it tries to call the third argument as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to the `set` method is now `null`, which is not a function. This would cause the `set` method to throw an error when it tries to call the third argument as a function.

DONE.
