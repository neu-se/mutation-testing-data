  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current execution context, whereas `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0]` refers to the first element of the `args` array, whereas `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`.

DONE.
