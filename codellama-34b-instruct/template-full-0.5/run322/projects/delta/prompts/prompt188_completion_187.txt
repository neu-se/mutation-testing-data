  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable is a string, and adding the string `'1'` to it would change the value of `embedType`, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable is a string, and multiplying it by the number `2` would change the value of `embedType`, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable is a string, and calling the `toUpperCase()` method on it would change the value of `embedType`, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

DONE.
