  Sure! Here are three mutants for the given code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
array[^i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator is a bitwise XOR, and it will flip the bits of `i` instead of incrementing it. This will cause the loop to infinitely loop over the same element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
array[i++ + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` will increment the index by 2 instead of 1, which will cause the loop to skip over every other element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` will increment the index by 1, but it will not reset the index back to 0 when it reaches the end of the array. This will cause the loop to continue indefinitely, potentially causing an infinite loop.
