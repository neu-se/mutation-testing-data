  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the promise to resolve immediately with no value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise).then(reject, resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the resolution values of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise).then(function (value) { return somethingElse })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a different value.

DONE.
