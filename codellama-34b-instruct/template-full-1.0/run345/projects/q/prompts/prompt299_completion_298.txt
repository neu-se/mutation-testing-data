  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce a different result when x and y are not equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce a different result when x and y are not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y + z
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce a different result when x, y, and z are not equal to 0.

DONE.
