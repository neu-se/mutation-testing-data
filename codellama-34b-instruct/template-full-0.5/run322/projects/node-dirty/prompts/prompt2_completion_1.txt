  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, [cb]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method of `Map` takes two arguments, but the code fragment only passes one argument, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, [cb, null]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method of `Map` takes two arguments, but the code fragment passes two arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, [cb, undefined]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method of `Map` takes two arguments, but the code fragment passes two arguments, which would cause an error.

DONE.
