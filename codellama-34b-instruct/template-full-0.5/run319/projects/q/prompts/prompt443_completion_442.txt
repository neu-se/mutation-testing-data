  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the `reason` object to be coerced into a number, which would likely produce a different result than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method would return a string representation of the `reason` object, which would likely be different than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf()` method would return a primitive value representation of the `reason` object, which would likely be different than the original code.

DONE.
