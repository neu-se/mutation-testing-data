```
'person', 'peepz'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "people" is not in the list of exceptions, so it would not be recognized as a plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peeps'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "peeps" is not in the list of exceptions, so it would not be recognized as a plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peeps'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "peeps" is not in the list of exceptions, so it would not be recognized as a plural form.
