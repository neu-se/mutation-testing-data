  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? err : null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is truthy and returns `err` if it is, and `null` if it isn't.

DONE.
