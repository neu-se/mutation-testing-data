  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would only update the value of a key if the new value is not `undefined`. This would prevent the method from overwriting existing values with `undefined`, which could be useful in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would only update the value of a key if the new value is `null`. This would prevent the method from overwriting existing values with `null`, which could be useful in certain scenarios.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === null || val === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would only update the value of a key if the new value is either `null` or `undefined`. This would prevent the method from overwriting existing values with `null` or `undefined`, which could be useful in certain scenarios.

DONE.
