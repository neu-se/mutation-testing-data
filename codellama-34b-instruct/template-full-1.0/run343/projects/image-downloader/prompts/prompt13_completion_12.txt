  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dropbox.propists.decodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `dropbox.propists.decodeURIComponent` returns a string, while `decodeURIComponent` returns a URIError if the URI is malformed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(true).decodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `(true).decodeURIComponent` returns a string, while `decodeURIComponent` is a function and does not have a `decodeURIComponent` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null.decodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `null.decodeURIComponent` returns a string, while `decodeURIComponent` is a function and does not have a `decodeURIComponent` property.

DONE.
