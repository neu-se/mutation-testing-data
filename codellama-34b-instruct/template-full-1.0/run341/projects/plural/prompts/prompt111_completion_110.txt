  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|<'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra "<" character to the beginning of the regular expression, which could cause the regular expression to match different strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 '|>+'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra "+" character to the end of the regular expression, which could cause the regular expression to match different strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|>-'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra "-" character to the end of the regular expression, which could cause the regular expression to match different strings.

DONE.
