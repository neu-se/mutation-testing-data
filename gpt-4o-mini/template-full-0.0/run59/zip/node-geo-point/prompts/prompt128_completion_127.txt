Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point, this
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments, which would change the reference points used in the distance calculation, potentially leading to incorrect distance results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the actual point with a fixed point at coordinates (0, 0), which would always return the distance from the origin, regardless of the actual point being compared.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ latitude: this.latitude + 1, longitude: this.longitude + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object with modified latitude and longitude values (incremented by 1), which would lead to an incorrect distance calculation based on these altered coordinates.

DONE.
