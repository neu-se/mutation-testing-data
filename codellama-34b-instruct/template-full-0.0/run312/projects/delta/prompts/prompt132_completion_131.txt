  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the next op is an insert operation, but replacing it with null would cause the check to always return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the next op is an insert operation, but replacing it with undefined would cause the check to always return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the next op is an insert operation, but replacing it with a new op would cause the check to always return true.

DONE.
