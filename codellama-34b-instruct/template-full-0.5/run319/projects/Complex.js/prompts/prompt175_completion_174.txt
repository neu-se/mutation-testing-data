  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the absolute value of `c` and `d`, while this replacement only checks the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d < c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the absolute value of `c` and `d`, while this replacement only checks the real part of the complex number in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) > Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the absolute value of `c` and `d`, while this replacement checks the absolute value of `c` and `d` in the opposite direction.

DONE.
