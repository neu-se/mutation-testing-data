  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1, length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `Math.min` function to always return `otherIter.peekLength()`, which would cause the `newOp.retain` property to be set to the full length of the `otherIter.peek()` operation, rather than just the minimum of that length and the remaining length of the `thisIter` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1, length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `Math.min` function to always return `length`, which would cause the `newOp.retain` property to be set to the full length of the `thisIter` operation, rather than just the minimum of that length and the remaining length of the `otherIter` operation.
