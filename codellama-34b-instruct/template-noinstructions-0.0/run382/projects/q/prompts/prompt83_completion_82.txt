  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even if `flushing` is already `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because `!flushing` is always falsy, so the `if` statement would never be executed, even if `flushing` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing || true` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even if `flushing` is `false`.

DONE.
