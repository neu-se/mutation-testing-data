  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return an empty array, causing the `dispatch` method to be called with only one argument, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return an array with `undefined` as its only element, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an incorrect argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return an empty array, causing the `dispatch` method to be called with only one argument, which would result in an error.

DONE.
