  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a plural form of the word "cello," while the new code fragment is the singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cell'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a plural form of the word "cello," while the new code fragment is the singular form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celloes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a plural form of the word "cello," while the new code fragment is a different plural form.

DONE.
