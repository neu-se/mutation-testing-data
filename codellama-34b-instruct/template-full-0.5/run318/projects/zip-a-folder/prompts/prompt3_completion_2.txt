  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'zip', zipAFolderOptions}

This would result in different behavior because the `format` property is set to `'zip'` instead of `'tar'`, which would cause the file to be compressed using the ZIP format instead of the TAR format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: { compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed }}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compression` property is set to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed` instead of the default `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high`, which would cause the file to be compressed with a lower level of compression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {
