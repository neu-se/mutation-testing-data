  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the direction of the bearing calculation. Instead of calculating the bearing from the current point to the destination point, it would calculate the bearing from the current point to a point 180 degrees opposite the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing from a point 90 degrees clockwise from the current point to the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing from the current point to a point 180 degrees opposite the destination point.

DONE.
