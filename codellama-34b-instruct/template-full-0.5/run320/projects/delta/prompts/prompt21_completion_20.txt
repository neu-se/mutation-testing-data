  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] != b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when the values are not equal, even if they are both `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when the values are not equal, even if they are both `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when the values are not equal, even if they are both `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
