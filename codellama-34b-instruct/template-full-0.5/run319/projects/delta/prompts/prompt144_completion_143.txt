  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to return a different value, potentially causing the `while` loop to execute differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to return a different value, potentially causing the `while` loop to execute differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to return a different value, potentially causing the `while` loop to execute differently.

DONE.
