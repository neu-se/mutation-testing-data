  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the attributes of the next operation instead of the current operation to the predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty attributes object instead of the current operation's attributes to the predicate function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the attributes of the next operation and an incremented index to the predicate function.

DONE.
