  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reducer` is a function that takes two arguments, but `acc` and `data` are not the correct arguments to pass to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is not the correct value to assign to `acc`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc` and `data` are not the correct values to add together.

DONE.
