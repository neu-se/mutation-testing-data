  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of 1 instead of 0, which could cause the caller to expect the database to contain more data than it actually does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of -1, which could cause the caller to expect the database to contain less data than it actually does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value that is one greater than the actual number of items in the database, which could cause the caller to expect the database to contain more data than it actually does.

DONE.
