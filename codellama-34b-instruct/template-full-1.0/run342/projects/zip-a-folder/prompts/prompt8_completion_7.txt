  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because `targetBasePath` and `src` are always different, thus the comparison would always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.split('/') === src.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the arrays of directory names in the `targetBasePath` and `src` paths, rather than the paths themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(targetBasePath) === path.dirname(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the parent directories of `targetBasePath` and `src`, rather than the paths themselves.

DONE.
