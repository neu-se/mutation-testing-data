  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not be able to handle the case where the word ends with "y" and is not a consonant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'^'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not be able to handle the case where the word ends with "x" or "s".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not be able to handle the case where the word ends with "y" and is not a consonant, and it would also not be able to handle the case where the word ends with "x" or "s".

DONE.
