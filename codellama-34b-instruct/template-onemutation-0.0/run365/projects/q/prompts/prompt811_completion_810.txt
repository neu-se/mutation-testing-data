  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` is a function that is expected to be called with no arguments, while the new code fragment `function () { throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback"); }` is a function that throws an error when called with no arguments. This would cause the promise returned by `Q.finally` to be rejected with the error, rather than resolved with the return value of the callback.
