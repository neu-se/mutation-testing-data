  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which could cause unexpected errors in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nullPromise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would never be resolved or rejected, causing the program to hang indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified of progress instead of resolved or rejected, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
