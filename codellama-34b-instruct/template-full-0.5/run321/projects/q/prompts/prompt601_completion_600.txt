  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would reject the promise with a reason, whereas `Q` would return a new promise that is resolved with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` would resolve the promise with a value, whereas `Q` would return a new promise that is resolved with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` would return a promise that is resolved with an array of values, whereas `Q` would return a new promise that is resolved with the given value.

DONE.
