  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter((rule) => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `.map()` creates a new array with the same number of elements as the original array, while `.filter()` creates a new array with a smaller number of elements (specifically, those elements for which the callback function returns true).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reduce((acc, rule) => acc.push(rule.clone()), [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `.reduce()` creates a new array with a reduced number of elements (specifically, the result of the callback function for each element), while `.push()` adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice().forEach((rule) => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `.slice()` creates a shallow copy of an array, while `.forEach()` iterates over each element of an array,
