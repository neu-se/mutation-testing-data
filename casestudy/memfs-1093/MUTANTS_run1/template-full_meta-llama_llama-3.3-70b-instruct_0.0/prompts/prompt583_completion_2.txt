Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.closeFile.bind(this, file)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to set the context of the `closeFile` function to `this`, which could potentially lead to issues if the context is not correctly set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this.closeFile(file)
```
This would result in different behavior because an anonymous function is used to wrap the call to `closeFile`, which could potentially lead to issues with the context or scope of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.closeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closeFile` function is passed as a reference without being bound to the correct context, which could potentially lead to issues if the function is called without the correct context.

DONE.
