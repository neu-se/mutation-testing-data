  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-sensitive, and would not match URLs that contain uppercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-insensitive, and would match URLs that contain uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/g.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now global, and would match all occurrences of the pattern in the URL, rather than just the first one.

DONE.
