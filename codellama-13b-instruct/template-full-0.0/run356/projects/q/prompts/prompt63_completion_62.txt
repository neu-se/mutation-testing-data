  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window, flush
```
This would result in different behavior because the `window` object is not defined in the current scope, and the `flush` function is not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, flush
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object in the current scope, and the `flush` function is not defined in the global object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, flush
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not an object, and the `flush` function is not defined in the `null` object.

DONE.
