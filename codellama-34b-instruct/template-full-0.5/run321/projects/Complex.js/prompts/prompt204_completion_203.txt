  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a` refers to the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re']` refers to the real part of the complex number, while `b` refers to the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im']` refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `b` refers to the real part.

DONE.
