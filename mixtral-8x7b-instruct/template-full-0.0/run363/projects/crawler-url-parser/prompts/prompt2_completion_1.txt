 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'str'.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in `_has_illegal_chars` is case-insensitive (`/i` flag), so converting the input string to lowercase would change the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'str'.replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would remove any character not present in the character set, whereas the original code checks if there is any character outside the character set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'str'.match(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/)
```
