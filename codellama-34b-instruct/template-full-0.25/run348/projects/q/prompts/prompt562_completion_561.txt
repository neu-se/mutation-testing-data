  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(exception.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with the value of the `exception.value` property, whereas the original code fragment would have caused the promise to be resolved with the value of `exception.value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(exception.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the `exception.value` property, whereas the original code fragment would have caused the promise to be rejected with the value of `exception.value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(exception.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the `exception.value` property, whereas the original code fragment would have caused the promise to be rejected with the value of `exception
