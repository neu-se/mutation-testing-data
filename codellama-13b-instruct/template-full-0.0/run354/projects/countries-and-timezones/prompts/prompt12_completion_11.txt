  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `result` object, while the modified code fragment returns an empty object. This could cause issues if the `result` object is used later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `result` object, while the modified code fragment returns `null`. This could cause issues if the `result` object is used later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `result` object, while the modified code fragment returns `undefined`. This could cause issues if the `result` object is used later in the code.

DONE.
