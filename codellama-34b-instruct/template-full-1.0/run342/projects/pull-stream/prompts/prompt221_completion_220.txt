  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment (`data`) is not null, but the new fragment (`null`) is always null. This could cause the code to behave differently when `map` returns a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment (`data`) is not undefined, but the new fragment (`undefined`) is always undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently when `map` returns an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('some error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment (`data`) is not an error, but the new fragment (`new Error('some error message')`) is always an error. This could cause the code to behave differently when `map` returns an error.

DONE.
