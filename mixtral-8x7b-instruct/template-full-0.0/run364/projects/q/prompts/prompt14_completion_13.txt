 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed, which initializes `ses.makeQ` instead of assigning the Q API to `global.Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty arrow function would always return `undefined`, making the `if` condition evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed, which initializes `ses.makeQ` instead of assigning the Q API to `global.Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would always evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed, which initializes `ses.makeQ` instead of assigning the Q API to `global.Q`.

DONE.
