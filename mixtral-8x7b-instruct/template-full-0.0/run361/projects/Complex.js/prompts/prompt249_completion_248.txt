 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of `Math.expm1(a * 0)` is always 0, which would cause the real part of the result to be 0 regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(a + 1)` is not the same as `Math.exp(a)`, which would cause the result to be different from the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(1 / a)` is not the same as `Math.exp(a)`, especially when `a` is negative. This could cause the result to be different from the original implementation.

DONE.
