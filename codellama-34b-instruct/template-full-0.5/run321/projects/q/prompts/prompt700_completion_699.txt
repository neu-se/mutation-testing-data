  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `concat()` returns a new array with the concatenated values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push()
```
This would result in different behavior because `push()` modifies the original array, while `concat()` returns a new array with the concatenated values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element from the array, while `concat()` returns a new array with the concatenated values.

DONE.
