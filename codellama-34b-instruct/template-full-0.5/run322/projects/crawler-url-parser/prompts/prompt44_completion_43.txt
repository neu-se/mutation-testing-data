  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would not be called with the `true` value for the `parseQueryString` parameter, which would cause the query string to not be parsed and the `search` property to not be set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would be called with the `null` value for the `parseQueryString` parameter, which would cause the query string to not be parsed and the `search` property to not be set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would be called with the string value `"hello"` for the `parseQueryString` parameter, which would cause the query string to be parsed as if it were a URL with the protocol `"hello"` and the host `""` (empty string).

DONE.
