  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1], ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to behave differently when the arguments are not commutative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the function, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is being replaced with a different value, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
