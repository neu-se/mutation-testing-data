  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `javascript` protocol would no longer be detected, which could potentially break functionality or security measures that rely on this detection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(https:|mailto:|ftp:)/gi.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `https` protocol would now be included in the detection, which could potentially change the behavior of the code when encountering URLs with this protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now use a non-capturing group `(?: )` instead of a capturing group `( )` for the protocols, which could potentially improve performance.

DONE.
