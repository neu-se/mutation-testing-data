  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with the given value, whereas `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is called with a different error message than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is called with a different error object than the original code.

DONE.
