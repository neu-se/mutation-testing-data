  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument of the `promiseDispatch` function as the first argument to the `when` method, instead of passing the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array without the first element as the first argument to the `when` method, instead of passing the `args` array as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array with the number `1` appended to it as the first argument to the `when` method, instead of passing the `args` array as is.

DONE.
