  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb] = function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `generator[verb]` function is overwritten with an empty function, which would cause any calls to it to do nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb] = function() { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `generator[verb]` function is overwritten with a function that throws an error, which would cause any calls to it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb] = function() { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `generator[verb]` function is overwritten with a function that returns `undefined`, which would cause any calls to it to return `undefined`.

DONE.
