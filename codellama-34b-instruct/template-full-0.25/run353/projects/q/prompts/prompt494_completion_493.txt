  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `reason`, which would change the value of the promise rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `reason` by 2, which would change the value of the promise rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method would convert the value of `reason` to a string, which would change the type of the promise rejection.

DONE.
