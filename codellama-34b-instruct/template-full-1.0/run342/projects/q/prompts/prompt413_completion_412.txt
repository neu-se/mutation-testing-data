  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPrimitive
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPrimitive` checks if a value is a primitive data type, such as a number or string, whereas `isObject` checks if a value is an object, including arrays and functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `isArray` checks if a value is an array, whereas `isObject` checks if a value is generally an object, including arrays and functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFunction
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFunction` checks if a value is a function, whereas `isObject` checks if a value is generally an object, including arrays and functions.

DONE.
