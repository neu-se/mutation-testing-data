  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 var i = 0; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop starts at 0 instead of 1, which means the first argument will be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will iterate one extra time, which could cause an error if the last argument is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop starts at the end of the array instead of the beginning, which could cause problems if the array is not contiguous or if the functions are not called in the correct order.

DONE.
