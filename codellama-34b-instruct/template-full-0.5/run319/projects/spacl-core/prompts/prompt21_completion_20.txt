  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the regular expression to match a backslash character instead of a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the regular expression to match either a backslash character or a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the regular expression to match a forward slash character.

DONE.
