  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.hostname == linkurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.host` includes the port number, while `pageurl.hostname` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host.includes(linkurl.host)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.host` includes the port number, while `pageurl.host.includes()` checks if the given string is a substring of the hostname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host.indexOf(linkurl.host) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.host` includes the port number, while `pageurl.host.indexOf()` checks if the given string is a substring of the hostname, and returns the index of the first occurrence or -1 if not found.

DONE.
