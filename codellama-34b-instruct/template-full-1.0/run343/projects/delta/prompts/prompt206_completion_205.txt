  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(otherOp.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is not a method of the `delta` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is not a method of the `delta` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(otherOp.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is not a method of the `delta` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
