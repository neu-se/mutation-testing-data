Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link.getName()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the name of the link instead of its parent path, potentially causing issues in the `Dirent` object's `path` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link.getNode()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the node associated with the link instead of its parent path, which could lead to a runtime error when trying to assign it to the `path` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/' + link.getName()
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends a slash to the link's name, which may not be the correct parent path, potentially causing issues in the `Dirent` object's `path` property.

DONE.
