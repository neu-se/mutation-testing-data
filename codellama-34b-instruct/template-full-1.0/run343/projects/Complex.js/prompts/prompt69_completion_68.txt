  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + a['im'] * b['re'] - Math.cos(a['im'] * b['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines multiplication and cosine functions, which would alter the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im'] * b['re'] + Math.atan(a['im'] * b['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines multiplication and atan functions, which would alter the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im'] * b['re'] - Math.sqrt(a['im'] * b['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines multiplication and square root functions, which would alter the result.

DONE.
