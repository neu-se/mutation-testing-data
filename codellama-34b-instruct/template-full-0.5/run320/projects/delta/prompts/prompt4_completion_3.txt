  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the first argument `a` instead of the second argument `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` instead of the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `undefined` instead of the expected result.

DONE.
