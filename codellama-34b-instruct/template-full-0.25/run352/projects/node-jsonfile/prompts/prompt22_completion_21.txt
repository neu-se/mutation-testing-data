  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\ufeff/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a regular expression to remove the BOM, whereas the original code uses the `stripBom` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first character of the content, whereas the original code uses the `stripBom` function to remove the BOM.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first character of the content, whereas the original code uses the `stripBom` function to remove the BOM.

DONE.
