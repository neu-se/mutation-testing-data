  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so the code would throw an error if `cb` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, so the code would not execute the `return cb(<PLACEHOLDER>, generate())` line if `cb` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", so the code would not execute the `return cb(<PLACEHOLDER>, generate())` line if `cb` is not defined.

DONE.
