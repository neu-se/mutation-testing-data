  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `z['im']` to the result of `parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1])`, which is a floating-point number. Replacing it with `1` would cause the code to always set `z['im']` to `1`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = tokens[i + 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `z['im']` to the result of `parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1])`, which is a floating-point number. Replacing it with `tokens[i + 1]` would cause the code to set `z['im']` to the next token in the input string, which may not be a valid number.
