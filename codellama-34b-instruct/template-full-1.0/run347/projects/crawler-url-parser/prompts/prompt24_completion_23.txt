  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*$/
```
This would result in the regular expression matching any character (including line terminators) because `dotAll` flag is not set and `multiline` flag is not set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\//g
```
This would result in the regular expression matching the `/` character because `dotAll` flag is not set and `multiline` flag is not set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^\/#]*$/
```
This would result in the regular expression matching anything except line terminators and `/` characters because `dotAll` flag is not set and `multiline` flag is not set.

DONE.
