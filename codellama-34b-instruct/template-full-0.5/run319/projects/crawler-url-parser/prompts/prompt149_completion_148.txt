  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splits the path by forward slashes, while the replaced code splits it by spaces. This would cause the code to treat the path as a string of words, rather than a path with multiple levels.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split(":")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splits the path by forward slashes, while the replaced code splits it by colons. This would cause the code to treat the path as a string of colon-separated values, rather than a path with multiple levels.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code splits the path by forward slashes, while the replaced code splits it into individual characters. This would cause the code to treat the path as a string of individual characters, rather than
