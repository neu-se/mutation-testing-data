  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to return the values of the `attributes` object instead of the keys, which may cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to return an array of key-value pairs of the `attributes` object instead of just the keys, which may cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.length
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to return the length of the `attributes` object instead of the keys, which may cause the function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
