  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).forEach(getTimezone);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the `getTimezone` function for each element in the `data.timezones` object, whereas the original code fragment only executed the function for each element in the `data.countries` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(data.timezones).forEach(getTimezone);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the `getTimezone` function for each element in the `data.timezones` object, whereas the original code fragment only executed the function for each element in the `data.countries` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.countries).forEach(getCountry);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the `getCountry` function for each element in the `data.countries` object, whereas
