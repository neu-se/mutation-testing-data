Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `data` to a string, which may lead to unexpected results if `data` is not a string or if it contains non-string elements, potentially causing parsing issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.html()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call the `html()` method on `data`, which is not guaranteed to exist, leading to a runtime error if `data` is not a Cheerio object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the first element of `data` as if it were an array, which may not be valid if `data` is a string or an object, potentially causing incorrect parsing or an error.

DONE.
