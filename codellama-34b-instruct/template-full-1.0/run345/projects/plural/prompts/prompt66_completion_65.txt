  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('dog', 'dogs')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to match words with the "memo" suffix, while this code fragment uses a specific word to match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^memo/, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a specific word to match, while this code fragment uses a regular expression to match words with the "memo" suffix.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a specific word to match, while this code fragment uses a function to perform the pluralization.

DONE.
