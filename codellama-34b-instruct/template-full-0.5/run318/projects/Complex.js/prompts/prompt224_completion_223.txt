  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than or equal to 0, while this replacement code fragment only checks if `a` is greater than 0. This means that the original code fragment would return `true` for `a = 0`, while the replacement code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than or equal to 0, while this replacement code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to 0. This means that the original code fragment would return `true` for `a = 0`, while the replacement code fragment would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than or equal to 0, while this replacement
