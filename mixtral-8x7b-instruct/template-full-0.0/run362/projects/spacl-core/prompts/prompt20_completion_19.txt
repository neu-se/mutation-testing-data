 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(string,'/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string is followed by a '/', instead of checking if the string ends with '/'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
string.slice(-1) === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the last character of the string instead of checking if the string ends with '/'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
string.indexOf('/', string.length - 1) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string contains a '/' at the second last position instead of checking if the string ends with '/'.

DONE.
