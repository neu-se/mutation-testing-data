  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object, rather than the `this` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object, rather than the `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the `Q` object, rather than the `this` object.

DONE.
