  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the reduce function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the reduce function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the reduce function to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
