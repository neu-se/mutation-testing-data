  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the iterator to peek at the next operation, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the iterator to peek at the previous operation, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the iterator to peek at twice the length of the current operation, potentially leading to a different result.

DONE.
