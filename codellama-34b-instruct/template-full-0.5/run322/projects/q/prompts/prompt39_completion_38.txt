  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (domain) {
  domain.exit(<PLACEHOLDER>);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.exit()` method would be called with a different argument, which could potentially have different effects on the program's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (domain) {
  domain.exit(null);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.exit()` method would be called with a different argument, which could potentially have different effects on the program's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (domain) {
  domain.exit(undefined);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.exit()` method would be called with a different argument, which could potentially have different effects on the program's behavior.

DONE.
