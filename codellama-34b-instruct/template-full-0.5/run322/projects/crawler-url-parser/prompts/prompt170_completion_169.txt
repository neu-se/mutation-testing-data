  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain === pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `==` operator, which checks for equality after converting the operands to a common type, while the new code uses the `===` operator, which checks for both equality and type equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain !== pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, while the new code checks for inequality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.includes(pageurl.domain)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for exact equality, while the new code checks if the `pageurl.domain` is a substring of `linkurl.domain`.

DONE.
