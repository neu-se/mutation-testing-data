  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid argument for the `_load` method, and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load('./not-a-valid-path')
```
This would result in different behavior because `./not-a-valid-path` is not a valid path for the `_load` method to read from.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load(this.path + '_not-a-valid-path')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` variable is no longer a valid path for the `_load` method to read from.

DONE.
