  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { xmlMode: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `xmlMode` option would cause Cheerio to parse the input data as XML, which could result in different parsing behavior than the default HTML parsing mode.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { decodeEntities: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `decodeEntities` option would cause Cheerio to decode HTML entities in the input data, which could result in different parsing behavior than the default behavior of not decoding entities.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { lowerCaseTags: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lowerCaseTags` option would cause Cheerio to lowercase all tag names in the input data, which could result in different parsing behavior than the default behavior of preserving case.

DONE.
