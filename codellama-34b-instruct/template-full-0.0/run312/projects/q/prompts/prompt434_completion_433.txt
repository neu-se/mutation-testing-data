  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is not being checked for strict equality with `false`, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof trackUnhandledRejections === "boolean"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is not being used to check if `trackUnhandledRejections` is a boolean value, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is not being checked for strict inequality with `true`, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
