  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the array instead of removing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two elements of the array instead of removing them.

DONE.
