  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg']` is a different property than `a['abs']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['re']` is a different property than `a['abs']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a constant value, and the test suite should not pass when a constant value is used instead of a variable.

DONE.
