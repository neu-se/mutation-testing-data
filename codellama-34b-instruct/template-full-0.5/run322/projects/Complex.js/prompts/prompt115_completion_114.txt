  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is parsing the input `a`, while the new code fragment is adding 1 to the input `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is parsing the input `a`, while the new code fragment is multiplying the input `a` by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is parsing the input `a`, while the new code fragment is dividing the input `a` by 2.

DONE.
