  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones !== memoizedTimezones + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizedTimezones` variable is incremented every time a timezone is memoized, so the condition would always be false if the number of total timezones is equal to the number of memoized timezones.

DONE.
