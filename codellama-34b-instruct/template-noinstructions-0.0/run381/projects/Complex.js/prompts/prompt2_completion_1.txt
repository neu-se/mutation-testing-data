  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a double value, while `x + 1` is a double value plus an integer value, which would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a double value, while `x * 2` is a double value multiplied by an integer value, which would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a double value, while `x / 2` is a double value divided by an integer value, which would result in a different value.

DONE.
