Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `mapper` is strictly equal to `null`, which would only return `id` if `mapper` is exactly `null`, ignoring other falsy values like `undefined` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof mapper === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `mapper` is `undefined`, which would return `id` only when `mapper` is not defined at all, rather than checking for any falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `mapper` is strictly equal to `true`, which would only return `id` if `mapper` is explicitly set to `true`, ignoring all other values including falsy ones.

DONE.
