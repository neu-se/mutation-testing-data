  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `toTile` method would receive `null` instead of the expected instance of `GeoPoint`, leading to a TypeError or null pointer exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nonExistentVariable
```
This would result in different behavior because `nonExistentVariable` is not defined and would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.latitude` is a number and would be used as the first argument to `toTile`, which expects an instance of `GeoPoint`.

DONE.
