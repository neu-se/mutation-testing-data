  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being added to the `dispatch` method, which may cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument with a value of `null` is being added to the `dispatch` method, which may cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, function() {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument with a value of an empty function is being added to the `dispatch` method, which may cause it to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
