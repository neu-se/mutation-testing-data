  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= this.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, and the condition would check for less than or equal to instead of less than.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < this.length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one fewer times, and the condition would check for less than instead of less than or equal to.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i >= this.length; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, and the condition would check for greater than or equal to instead of less than or equal to.

DONE.
