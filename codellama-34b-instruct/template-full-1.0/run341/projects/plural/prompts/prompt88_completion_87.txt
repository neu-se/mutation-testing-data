  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `'people'` is correct, while `'persons'` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'human beings'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `'people'` is a more common and concise term for referring to a group of people, while `'human beings'` is a more formal and less common term.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'employees'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `'people'` does not specify a particular group of people, while `'employees'` specifies a group of people who work for a particular organization.

DONE.
