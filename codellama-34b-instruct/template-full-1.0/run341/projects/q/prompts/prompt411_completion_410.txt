  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (<value>) { return <value> }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return a resolved promise with the same value as the input, regardless of the outcome of the previous promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (<value>) { return <value> + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return a resolved promise with a value that is one greater than the input, regardless of the outcome of the previous promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (<value>) { return <value> * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return a resolved promise with a value that is twice the input, regardless of the outcome of the previous promise.

DONE.
