  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a method that checks if a number is finite, but it is not being called correctly. The parentheses are missing, so it would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite'](1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a method that checks if a number is finite, but it is not being called correctly. The argument `1` is not a valid argument for the method, so it would result in a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite'](this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a method that checks if a number is finite, but it is not being called correctly. The argument `this['im']` is not a valid argument for the method, so it would result in a type error
