  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `undefined`, and the `set` method would treat it as a valid value to be stored in the database, whereas `undefined` would be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, NaN, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", and it would cause the `set` method to throw an error when trying to store it in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, "undefined", cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"undefined"` is a valid value that can be stored in the database, whereas `undefined` is not.

DONE.
