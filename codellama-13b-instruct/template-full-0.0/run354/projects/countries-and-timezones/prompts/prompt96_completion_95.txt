  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the test is whether the element is not `undefined`. The `map` method, on the other hand, returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method applies a function to each element in the array and returns a single value. In this case, the function is a ternary operator that returns the first element of the array if it is not `undefined`, or `null` otherwise. The `map` method, on the other hand, returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.find
```
This would result in different behavior
