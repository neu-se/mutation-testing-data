  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calculating the absolute value of `c`, while the replaced code fragment is calculating the square of `c`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calculating the absolute value of `c`, while the replaced code fragment is calculating the product of `c` and `d`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calculating the absolute value of `c`, while the replaced code fragment is calculating the sum of `c` and `d`.

DONE.
