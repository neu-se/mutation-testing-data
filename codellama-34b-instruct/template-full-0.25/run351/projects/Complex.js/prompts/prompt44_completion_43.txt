  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `undefined`, and the original code fragment checks for `undefined` specifically.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` and `b` are not the same object, rather than checking if `b` is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `b` and `a` are not the same object, rather than checking if `b` is not `undefined`.

DONE.
