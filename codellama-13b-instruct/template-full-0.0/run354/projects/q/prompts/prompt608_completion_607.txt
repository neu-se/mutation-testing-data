  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `args` array, while the new code fragment returns an empty array. This could cause issues if the code relies on the `args` array being present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `args` array, while the new code fragment returns `undefined`. This could cause issues if the code relies on the `args` array being present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `args` array, while the new code fragment returns `null`. This could cause issues if the code relies on the `args` array being present.

DONE.
