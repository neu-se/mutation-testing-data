  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object or null, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is an object and not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object or null, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is an instance of the `Object` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object or null, while this new code fragment checks if `a` has a constructor that is the `Object` class.

DONE.
