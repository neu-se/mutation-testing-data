  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.url` property is being accessed instead of the entire `options` object. This could cause the test to fail if the `options.url` property is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.dest` property is being accessed instead of the entire `options` object. This could cause the test to fail if the `options.dest` property is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pathname` property of the `options.url` object is being accessed instead of the entire `options` object. This could cause the test to fail if the `options.url` property is not defined or if the `pathname` property is not defined.

DONE.
