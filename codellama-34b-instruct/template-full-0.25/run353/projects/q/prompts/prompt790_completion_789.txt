  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a function, and it would cause a runtime error when the `then` method is called on the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a function, and it would cause a runtime error when the `then` method is called on the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be called when the `then` method is called on the promise, and it would not have the same effect as the original code fragment.

DONE.
