  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because both arguments are now the same, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the difference between the two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because one of the arguments is now undefined, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the presence or absence of the argument.

DONE.
