  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
  if (err != null) this.emit('error', err);
  for (const cb of cbs) cb(err);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this._writeStream.write()` with a callback function that checks for errors and emits an error event if necessary, while this new code fragment uses `this._writeStream.write()` without a callback function, which could result in errors not being caught and handled properly.
