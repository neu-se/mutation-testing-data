  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'string' && !lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp.retain` is a number, but the new code fragment checks if it is a string. This could cause the `chop()` method to behave differently if the `lastOp.retain` property is not a number.

DONE.
