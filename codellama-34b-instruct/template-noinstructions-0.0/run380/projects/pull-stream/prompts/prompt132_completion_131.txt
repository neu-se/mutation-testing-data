  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `null` when `i` is greater than `max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, i--
```
This would result in different behavior because `i--` would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, which would cause the function to return a different value when `i` is greater than `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because `i, i++` would increment `i` twice, which would cause the function to return a different value when `i` is greater than `max`.

DONE.
