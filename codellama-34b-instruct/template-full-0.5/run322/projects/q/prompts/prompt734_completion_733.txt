  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first promise in the array, instead of all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all but the first promise in the array, instead of all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(Q.reject("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional rejected promise to the array, which would cause the `all` method to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

DONE.
