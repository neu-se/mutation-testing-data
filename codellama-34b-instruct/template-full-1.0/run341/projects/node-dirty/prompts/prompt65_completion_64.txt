  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.write("")
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` does not destroy the stream, it only adds data to the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end("")
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` can only be called once and it closes the stream, whereas `destroy()` can be called multiple times and does not close the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because `close()` only stops the stream, it does not destroy it, whereas `destroy()` closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with it.

DONE.
