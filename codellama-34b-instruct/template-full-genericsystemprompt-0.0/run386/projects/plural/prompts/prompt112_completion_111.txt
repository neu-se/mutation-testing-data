```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the arrays in a different order, which could affect the resulting plural form.

```
misc.concat(games, illnesses)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the arrays in a different order, which could affect the resulting plural form.

DONE.
