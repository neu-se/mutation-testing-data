  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1 and ends with a slash, while the modified code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 0 and ends with a slash. This means that the modified code fragment would allow strings with a length of 1 to pass, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.endsWith('/') && string.charAt(0) === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1 and ends with a slash, while the modified code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1, ends with a slash, and the first character is a slash. This means that the modified code fragment would allow strings with a length greater than 1 and ending with a slash, but not starting with a slash, to pass,
