  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*a + b*b*Math.sin(2*a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `b*sin(2*a)` would change the sign of the return value, potentially returning a different complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*a + b*b*Math.cos(2*a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `b*cos(2*a)` would change the sign of the return value, potentially returning a different complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*a + b*b*Math.tan(2*a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `b*tan(2*a)` would introduce a nonlinear term, potentially changing the range of the return values and altering the behavior of the function.

DONE.
