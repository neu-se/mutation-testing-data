Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a '0' to the end of the string instead of removing trailing zeros, potentially altering the parsed value in unexpected ways.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the regex with the original value of `val`, instead of removing trailing zeros, potentially affecting the parsing of numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a decimal point to the end of the string, instead of removing trailing zeros, potentially causing errors when parsing the value as a number.

DONE.
