  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a different function that clears a timer set with `setInterval`, whereas `clearTimeout` clears a timer set with `setTimeout`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` sets a new timer, whereas `clearTimeout` clears an existing timer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause an error when called.

DONE.
