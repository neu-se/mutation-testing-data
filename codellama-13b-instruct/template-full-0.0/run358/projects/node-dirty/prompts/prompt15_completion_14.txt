  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called immediately, rather than being added to the queue. This could cause issues if the callback function relies on the data being persisted to disk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called with an error object, rather than being called with no arguments. This could cause issues if the callback function relies on the data being persisted to disk.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(cb, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called after a delay of 1 second, rather than being called immediately. This could cause issues if the callback function relies on the data being persisted to disk.

DONE.
