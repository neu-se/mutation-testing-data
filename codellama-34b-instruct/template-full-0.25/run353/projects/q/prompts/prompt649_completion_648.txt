  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is not a valid method for a promise, whereas "post" is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the "post" method is not a valid argument, whereas the second argument is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args, function() { return 1; }]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the "post" method is not a function, whereas the second argument is.

DONE.
