  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, updater(this.get(key)), cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with the current value of `key` in the `_data` map, and the result of that function would be stored back in the `_data` map at the same key. This is different from the original code, which stored the result of the `updater` function at the `key` passed in as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, updater(this.get(key), cb))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` callback function would be passed as an argument to the `updater` function, which is not what the original code did.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, updater(this.get(key)), cb)
```
This would result in
