  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
never(result.value, callback, errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because `never` is a function that returns a promise that never resolves, whereas `when` is a function that returns a promise that resolves with the value of the first promise that resolves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Testing mutation");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error to be thrown, which would be caught by the `catch` block and handled by the `deferred.reject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(result.value).then(callback, errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves with the value of `result.value`, and then call the `callback` or `errback` function with that value.

DONE.
