  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { normalizeHttps: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `normalizeHttps` option would cause the URL to be normalized to use the `https` protocol, even if the original URL used the `http` protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { normalizeProtocol: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `normalizeProtocol` option would cause the URL to be normalized to use the `http` protocol, even if the original URL used the `https` protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { removeQueryParameters: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `removeQueryParameters` option would cause the URL to retain any query parameters, even if the original URL did not have any query parameters.

DONE.
