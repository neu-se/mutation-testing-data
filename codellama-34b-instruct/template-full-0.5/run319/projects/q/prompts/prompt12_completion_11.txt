  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses` is a variable that is not defined in the provided code snippet, so the comparison `ses === "undefined"` would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof ses` would evaluate to `"undefined"` if `ses` is not defined, which is not the case in the provided code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses` is a variable that is not defined in the provided code snippet, so the comparison `ses !== "undefined"` would always evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
