  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` calls the `cb` function with the `aborted` argument, while the new code fragment `abortCb(aborted)` calls the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` argument. If `abortCb` is not defined, this would result in a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` calls the `cb` function with the `aborted` argument, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(
