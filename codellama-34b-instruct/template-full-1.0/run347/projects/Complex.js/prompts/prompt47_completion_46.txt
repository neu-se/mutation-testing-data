  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a || 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using logical AND operator, but the changed code is using OR operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!'abs' in a || 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using logical AND operator, but the changed code is using OR operator and using logical NOT operator on the first condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a ^ 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using logical AND operator, but the changed code is using XOR operator.

DONE.
