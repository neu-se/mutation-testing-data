  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cosh` function, which is the hyperbolic cosine, while the replacement code fragment uses the `sinh` function, which is the hyperbolic sine. These functions have different properties and can produce different results, even when used with the same input values.
