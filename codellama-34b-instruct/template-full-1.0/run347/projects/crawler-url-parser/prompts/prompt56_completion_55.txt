  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in a different behavior because the last argument is set to `false`, which would not parse the URL query strings, resulting in different extracted URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in a different behavior because the second argument is set to `false`, which would not remove default port numbers from the URL, resulting in different extracted URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, 1)
```
This would result in a different behavior because the last argument is set to `1`, which would include the path name in the extracted URL, resulting in different extracted URLs.

DONE.
