  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops !== null && typeof ops.ops === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of `ops.ops` instead of checking if it is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops !== null && ops.ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of `ops.ops` using the `instanceof` operator instead of using `Array.isArray`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops !== null && Object.prototype.toString.call(ops.ops) === '[object Array]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of `ops.ops` using the `Object.prototype.toString.call` method instead of using `Array.isArray`.

DONE.
