  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` advances the iterator to the next element, whereas `peek` only returns the next element without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` returns the current element of the iterator, whereas `peek` returns the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` returns a boolean indicating whether the iterator has more elements, whereas `peek` returns the next element.

DONE.
