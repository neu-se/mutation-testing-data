Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value being passed to the `deferred.notify` method by incrementing it by 1, which alters the intended progress notification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Progress error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces an error to be thrown during the progress notification, which would prevent the `deferred.notify` from being called, thus altering the flow of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` to the `deferred.notify` method, which may not be the expected value and could lead to unexpected handling of progress notifications.

DONE.
