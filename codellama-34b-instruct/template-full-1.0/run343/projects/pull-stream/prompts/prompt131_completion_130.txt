  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` is not incremented. The original code increments `i` by 1, but the mutated code sets `i` to `i + 1`, which has no effect on the value of `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i -= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` would be decremented instead of incrementing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` would be doubled instead of incrementing.

DONE.
