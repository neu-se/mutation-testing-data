  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = z['im'] + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, instead of setting it to 0 as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex(this['re'] + z['re'], this['im'] + z['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new Complex object with the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the original object and the provided Complex object, instead of modifying the original object as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] = z['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the imaginary part of the original object to the imaginary part of the provided Complex object, instead of setting it to 0 as the original code does.

DONE.
