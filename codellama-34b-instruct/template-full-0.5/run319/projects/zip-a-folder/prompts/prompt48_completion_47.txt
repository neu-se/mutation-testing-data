  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.destroy()` would destroy the archive, whereas `zipArchive.finalize()` would finalize the archive and prepare it for writing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.abort();
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.abort()` would abort the archive creation process, whereas `zipArchive.finalize()` would finalize the archive and prepare it for writing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.cancel();
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.cancel()` would cancel the archive creation process, whereas `zipArchive.finalize()` would finalize the archive and prepare it for writing.

DONE.
