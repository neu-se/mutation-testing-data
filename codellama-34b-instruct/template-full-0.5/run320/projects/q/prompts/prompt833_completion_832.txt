  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, whereas `progress` is a function. If `progress` is not defined, the code will throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid JavaScript value that represents the absence of any object value. If `progress` is not defined, the code will not throw an error, but it will also not do anything useful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number". If `progress` is not defined, the code will not throw an error, but it will also not do anything useful.

DONE.
