  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds the number down to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.exp` calculates the exponential function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` calculates the sine of a number, whereas `Math.exp` calculates the exponential function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` generates a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.exp` calculates the exponential function.

DONE.
