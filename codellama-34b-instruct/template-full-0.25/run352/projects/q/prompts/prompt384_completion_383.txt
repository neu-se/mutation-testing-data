  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method is called with the `value` argument, which is not the same as the original code where `value` is not passed as an argument to `thenResolve`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenReject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method is called with the `value` argument, which is not the same as the original code where `value` is not passed as an argument to `thenReject`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function () { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with a function that returns `value`, which is not the same as the original code where `value` is not returned from the `then` method
