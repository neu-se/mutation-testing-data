  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop(arr.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` expects an integer as its argument, but `arr.length - 1` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop(arr.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` expects an integer as its argument, but `arr.length` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop(arr.length - 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` expects an integer as its argument, but `arr.length - 2` is a string.

DONE.
