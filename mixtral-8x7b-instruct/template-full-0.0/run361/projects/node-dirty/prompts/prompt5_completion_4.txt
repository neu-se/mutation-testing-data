 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_data.delete()` method would not remove the key if the value is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_data.set()` method would overwrite the existing value with the integer `1`, instead of storing the value passed in the `val` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_data.set()` method would store a function instead of the value passed in the `val` variable.

DONE.
