  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

$(this).text().trim();

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text()` method, which returns the text content of the element, while the new code fragment uses the `text()` method with the `trim()` method, which removes whitespace from the beginning and end of the text content.
