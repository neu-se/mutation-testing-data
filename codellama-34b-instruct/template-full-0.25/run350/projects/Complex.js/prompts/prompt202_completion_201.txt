  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is not the same as the `re` property, and would cause the `pow` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is not the same as the `re` property plus one, and would cause the `pow` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is not the same as the `re` property multiplied by two, and would cause the `pow` function to return a different result.

DONE.
