  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', err);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any argument to the `emit` method, while this code fragment passes an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a string literal `'read_close'` to the `emit` method, while this code fragment passes a different string literal `'write_close'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', err);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any argument to the `emit` method, while this code fragment passes an error object.

DONE.
