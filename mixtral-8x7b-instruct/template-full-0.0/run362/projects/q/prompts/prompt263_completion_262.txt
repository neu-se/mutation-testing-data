 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(resolve => resolve(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because a new promise is created instead of resolving the existing deferred promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is called directly, bypassing the `become` function which updates the `resolvedPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value)
