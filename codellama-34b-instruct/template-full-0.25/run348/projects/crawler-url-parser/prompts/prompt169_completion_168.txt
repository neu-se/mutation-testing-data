  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the last path component from the URL, while this new code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the first path component from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/[^\/]*$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the last path component from the URL, while this new code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove all path components from the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/[^\/]*$/, "").replace(/\/[^\/]*$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the last path
