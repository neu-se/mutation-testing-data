  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is the opposite of `isZero`, so the `if` statement would have a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is not a number, and the `if` statement would have a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the value is a finite number, and the `if` statement would have a different outcome.

DONE.
