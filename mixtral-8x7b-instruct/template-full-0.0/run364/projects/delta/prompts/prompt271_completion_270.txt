 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
< 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the index is negative, which is not the intended condition for checking if there are more operations in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek() !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the peeked operation is not null, which is not the intended condition for checking if there are more operations in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of the peeked operation is greater than zero, which is not the intended condition for checking if there are more operations in the iterator.

DONE.
