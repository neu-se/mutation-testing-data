  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.a
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.a` is not a function, so it would throw an error when called as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.b
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.b` is not a function, so it would throw an error when called as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.c
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.c` is not a function, so it would throw an error when called as a function.

DONE.
