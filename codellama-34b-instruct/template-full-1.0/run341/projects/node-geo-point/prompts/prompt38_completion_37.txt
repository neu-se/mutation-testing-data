  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` operator would return 0 for all inputs, effectively reducing the `calculateDistance` function to `return 0 * 6371392.896`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(x) + cos(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` and `cos` operators return different values for different inputs, which would cause the `calculateDistance` function to return different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1 / x` expression would return different values for different inputs, which would cause the `calculateDistance` function to return different values.

DONE.
