  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `text` variable is included in the `tmpUrl.text` string, while this replacement code fragment checks if the `text` variable is included in the `tmpUrl.text.includes` string, which is likely not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `text` variable is included in the `tmpUrl.text` string, while this replacement code fragment checks if the `text` variable is included in the `tmpUrl.text.includes` string starting from the first character, which is likely not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `text` variable is included
