  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This change will cause the request to be made to a different URL than the one intended, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1)
```
This change will cause the request to be made to a different URL than the one intended, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.replace('https', 'http')
```
This change will cause the request to be made over HTTP instead of HTTPS, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or other issues.

DONE.
