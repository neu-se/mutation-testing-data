  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called immediately, rather than being called when the `drain` event is emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.on('drain', () => { this.close(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on` method is used to listen for the `drain` event, rather than the `once` method which is used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.off('drain', () => { this.close(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `off` method is used to remove the listener for the `drain` event, rather than the `once` method which is used in the original code.

DONE.
