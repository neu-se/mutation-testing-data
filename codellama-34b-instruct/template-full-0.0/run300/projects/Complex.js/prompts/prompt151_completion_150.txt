  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if `z` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is infinite.

DONE.
