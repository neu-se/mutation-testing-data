  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with `deep` set to `false`, which would create a shallow copy of the `rules` array instead of a deep copy. This could cause issues if the `rules` array contains objects that are modified by the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with `deep` set to `true`, but the `clone` method would not be called with the `deep` parameter set to `false`. This could cause issues if the `rules` array contains objects that are modified by the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with
