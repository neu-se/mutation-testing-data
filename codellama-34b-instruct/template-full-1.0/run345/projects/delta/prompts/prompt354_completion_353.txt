  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length of the sentence by one, making the output different from the original output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the length of the sentence by one, making the output different from the original output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the length of the sentence to zero, making the output different from the original output.

DONE.
