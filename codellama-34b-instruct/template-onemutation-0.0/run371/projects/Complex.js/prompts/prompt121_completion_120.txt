  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite. In this case, the code is checking if the result of the division is Not-a-Number, which is a different check than checking if it is infinite.

DONE.
