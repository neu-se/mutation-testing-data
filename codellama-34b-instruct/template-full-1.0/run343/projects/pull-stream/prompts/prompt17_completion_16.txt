  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only supports up to 4 arguments, but this modified code fragment would support 5 arguments. If a test case with 5 arguments is passed to the function, it would result in a different behavior than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only supports up to 4 arguments, but this modified code fragment would support 5 arguments, with the fifth argument being `null`. If a test case with 5 arguments is passed to the function, it would result in a different behavior than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], read)
