  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, but `Q` is a function that returns a promise and applies the specified property path to a new deferred promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a function that returns a promise and marks it as fulfilled with the specified value, but `Q` is a function that returns a promise and applies the specified property path to a new deferred promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a promise and marks it as rejected with the specified reason, but `Q` is a function that returns a promise and applies the specified property path to a new deferred promise.

DONE.
