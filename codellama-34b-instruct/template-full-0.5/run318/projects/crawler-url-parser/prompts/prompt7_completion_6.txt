  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `_has_illegal_chars` is being called with `currentUrlStr` instead of `baseUrlStr`, which could lead to different results if the two strings contain different types of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, ''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` is being
