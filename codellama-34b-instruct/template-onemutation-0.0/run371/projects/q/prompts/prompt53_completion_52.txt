  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" &&
        process.toString() === "[object process]" && process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process` object is not defined in the browser, so the `process.nextTick` function would not be available.

DONE.
