  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first character of the part, which could cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last character of the part, which could cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first and last characters of the part, which could cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

DONE.
