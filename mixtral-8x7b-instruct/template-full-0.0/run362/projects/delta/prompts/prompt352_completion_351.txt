 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a default value of an empty object for `op.attributes` instead of using `baseOp.attributes`. This could cause issues if the `invert` method relies on the presence of specific properties in `baseOp.attributes` that are not present in `op.attributes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a default value of an empty object for `baseOp.attributes` instead of using `op.attributes`. This could cause issues if the `invert` method relies on the presence of specific properties in `op.attributes` that are not present in `baseOp.attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it completely ignores the original `op.attributes` and `baseOp.attributes` and replaces them with an
