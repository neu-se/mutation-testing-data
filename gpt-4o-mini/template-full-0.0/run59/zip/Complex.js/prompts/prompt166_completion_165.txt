Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the current complex number is zero instead of checking if the divisor is zero, potentially leading to a division by zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the real part of the current complex number is zero, ignoring the imaginary part, which could lead to incorrect results when dividing complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both the divisor is infinite and the current complex number is zero, which is not a valid condition for division and could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
