  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.slice(1)` would return a new string that is a substring of the original `path`, starting from the second character. In contrast, `path` would return the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.toUpperCase()` would return a new string that is the original `path` converted to uppercase, while `path` would return the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.split('')` would return an array of strings, each of which is a single character of the original `path`, while `path` would return the original string.

DONE.
