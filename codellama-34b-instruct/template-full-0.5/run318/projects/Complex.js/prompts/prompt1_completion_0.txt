  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(x)` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number and is used as a method of the `Math` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x.abs()
```
This would result in different behavior because `x.abs()` is a method of the `Math` object that returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(x, y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(x, y)` is a function that returns the absolute value of a complex number, while `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number.

DONE.
