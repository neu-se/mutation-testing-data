  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(function(op) { return op.insert; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method is not returning any value, so the resulting array would be empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(function(op) { return op.insert; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method is returning a new array of values, but the `forEach` method is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(function(op) { return op.insert; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method is returning a new array of values that match the filter condition, but the `forEach` method is not.

DONE.
