  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `transform` is a different function from `invert`, and it would likely produce a different output for the given input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.compose
```
This would result in different behavior because `compose` is a different function from `invert`, and it would likely produce a different output for the given input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.diff
```
This would result in different behavior because `diff` is a different function from `invert`, and it would likely produce a different output for the given input.

DONE.
