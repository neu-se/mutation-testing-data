  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `arg` is a number, while the replaced code fragment checks if `arg` is not a number. This change would cause the `transform` method to behave differently when `arg` is not a number, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
