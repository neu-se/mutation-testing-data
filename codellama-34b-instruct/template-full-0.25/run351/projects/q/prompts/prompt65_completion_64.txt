  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(1)` is a function call with a different argument than the original `flush()` call, and it would cause a different behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(function() {})` is a function call with a different argument than the original `flush()` call, and it would cause a different behavior in the code.

DONE.
