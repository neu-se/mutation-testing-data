  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.longStackSupport` property would be set to `true` regardless of the value of `process.env.Q_DEBUG`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG === "true";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.longStackSupport` property would be set to `true` only if the value of `process.env.Q_DEBUG` is the string `"true"`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!process.env.Q_DEBUG;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.longStackSupport` property would be set to `true` only if the value of `process.env.Q_DEBUG` is falsy.

DONE.
