  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `tokens[i + 1]` as the argument to `parseFloat()`, while the modified code fragment always uses the value `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1] || 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `tokens[i + 1]` as the argument to `parseFloat()`, while the modified code fragment uses the value `1` if `tokens[i + 1]` is undefined or null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1] || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `tokens[i + 1]` as the argument to `parseFloat()`, while the modified code fragment uses the value `0` if `
