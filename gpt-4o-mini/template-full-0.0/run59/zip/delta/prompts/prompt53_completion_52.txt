Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `handler` is strictly `undefined`, which would not catch cases where `handler` is `null` or any other falsy value, potentially leading to a situation where a valid handler is incorrectly assumed to be absent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `handler` is not `null` or `undefined`, which would allow the code to proceed even if `handler` is an invalid object or function, thus bypassing the error handling for missing handlers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `handler` is strictly equal to `true`, which is not a valid condition for checking the existence of a handler, leading to a situation where the error is never thrown even when a handler is missing.

DONE.
