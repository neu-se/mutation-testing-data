  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve with the string "foo", rather than the expected result of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve with undefined, rather than the expected result of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Example error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would reject with the error message "Example error", rather than resolving with the expected result of the promise.

DONE.
