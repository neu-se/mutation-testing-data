  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which is what the original code fragment was intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
