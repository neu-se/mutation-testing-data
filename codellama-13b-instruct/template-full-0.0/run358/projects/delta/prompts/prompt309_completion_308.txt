  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the first line of the text, while the modified code fragment returns the second line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the first line of the text, while the modified code fragment returns the last line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.split('\n')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the first line of the text, while the modified code fragment returns the second line.

DONE.
