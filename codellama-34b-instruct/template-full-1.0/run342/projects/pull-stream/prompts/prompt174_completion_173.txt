  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because `size()` is not a valid method for arrays in JavaScript. The original code uses `array.length` to get the length of the array, but if we replace it with `array.size()`, it will return `undefined`, which will cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the array, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with all the elements except the first one, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
