Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the `onAbort` callback would mean that the abort handling logic would not be executed, potentially leading to unhandled abort scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error('Abort!'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `onAbort` with a function that throws an error would cause the program to crash instead of gracefully handling the abort, which could lead to unexpected application behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `onAbort` would mean that the abort callback is not defined, which could lead to a situation where the abort logic is not executed, similar to using `null`, but with potentially different implications in how the code handles the absence of a callback.

DONE.
