  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], unhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the `rejectionHandled` event with the reason and rejection that were previously tracked, rather than the reason and promise that were passed to `trackRejection`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the `rejectionHandled` event with the reason and promise that were passed to `trackRejection`, rather than the reason and rejection that were previously tracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the `rejectionHandled` event with the reason that was previously tracked, rather than the reason that was passed to `trackRejection`.

DONE.
