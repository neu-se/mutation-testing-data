  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid_timezone"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return `null` instead of a valid timezone object, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid_country"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return `null` instead of a valid country object, causing the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid_timezone_name"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return `null` instead of a valid timezone object, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an empty array.

DONE.
