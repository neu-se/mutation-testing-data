  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second promise in the array, rather than the first promise, which may be important if the order of the promises matters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first promise in the array, rather than the second promise, which may be important if the order of the promises matters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a resolved promise, rather than a rejected promise, which may be important if the function is designed to handle errors.

DONE.
