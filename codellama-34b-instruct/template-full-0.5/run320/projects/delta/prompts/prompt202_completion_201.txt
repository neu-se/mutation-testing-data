  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(this.ops[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the first op of the delta to the delta, which is not what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(other.ops[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the first op of the other delta to the delta, which is not what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a new op to the delta, which is not what the original code does.

DONE.
