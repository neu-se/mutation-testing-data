  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `this` is infinite, while this replacement checks if `z` is infinite as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is infinite, while this replacement checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is infinite, while this replacement checks if neither `this` nor `z` are infinite.

DONE.
