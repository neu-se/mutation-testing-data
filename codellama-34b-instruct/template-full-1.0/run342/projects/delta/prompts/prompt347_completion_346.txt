  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 baseOpData + 1 
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the placeholder to be a value that is equal to or less than the length of `baseOp`. Adding 1 to `baseOpData`, however, could cause the resulting value to be greater than the length of `baseOp`, potentially leading to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp` is a Delta object, while `baseOpData` is a string. The original code expects `baseOpData` to be a string, not a Delta object, so using `baseOp` instead would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `baseOpData` to be a string, while `baseOp.length` is a number. Using the length of `baseOp` instead of
