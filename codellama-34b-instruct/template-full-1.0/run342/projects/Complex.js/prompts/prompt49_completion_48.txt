  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!a['abs']` will always be `true` when `a['abs']` is a non-empty string, while `Number.isFinite(a['abs'])` will only be `true` when `a['abs']` is a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['abs'] !== 1` will be `true` when `a['abs']` is not equal to `1`, while `Number.isFinite(a['abs'])` will only be `true` when `a['abs']` is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isNaN(a['abs'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isNaN(a['abs'])` will be `true` when `a['abs
