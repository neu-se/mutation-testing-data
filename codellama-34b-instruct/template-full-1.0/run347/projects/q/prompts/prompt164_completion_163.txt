  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially causing the loop to iterate over a different range of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var j = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop variable would be named 'j' instead of 'i', but the loop would still iterate over the same range of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0, j = i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop variable would still be named 'i', but the loop would start at 0 and increment the variable 'j' at the same time, potentially causing the loop to iterate over a different range of values.

DONE.
