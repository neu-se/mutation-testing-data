 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
self.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the success callback would be called instead of the error callback when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function does not have the same behavior as the original `self.reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject
