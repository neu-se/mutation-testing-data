Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name "call" suggests invoking a function immediately rather than applying arguments to it, which changes the intended use of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"execute"
```
This would result in different behavior because "execute" is not a recognized method in this context, leading to a potential runtime error instead of applying the function as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"applyWithContext"
```
This would result in different behavior because "applyWithContext" implies a different function signature or behavior that may not exist, causing the promise to not resolve correctly or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
