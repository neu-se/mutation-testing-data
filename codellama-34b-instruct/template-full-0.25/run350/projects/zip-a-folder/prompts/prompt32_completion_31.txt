  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output` stream would no longer emit an `'error'` event, but instead an `'end'` event, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output` stream would no longer emit an `'error'` event, but instead a `'close'` event, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output` stream would no longer emit an `'error'` event, but instead a `'finish'` event, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
