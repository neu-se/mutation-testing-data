 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a division by zero error when b is 0, while the original code fragment would return NaN for that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a positive value, while the original code fragment returns a negative value when b is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it squares the value of b, while the original code fragment returns the value of b unchanged.

DONE.
