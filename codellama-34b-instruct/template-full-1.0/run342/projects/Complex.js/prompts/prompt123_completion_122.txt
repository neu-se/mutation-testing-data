  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z !== NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method checks if a number is positive or negative infinity, while the `!== NaN` check only checks if the number is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-z === z
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method checks if a number is positive or negative infinity, while the `-z === z` check only checks if a number is equal to its negative value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z) === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method checks if a number is positive or negative infinity, while the `Math.abs(z) === Infinity` check only checks if a number is equal to the absolute value of infinity.

DONE.
