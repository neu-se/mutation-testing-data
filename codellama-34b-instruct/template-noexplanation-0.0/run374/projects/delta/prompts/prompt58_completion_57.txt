  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `ops` parameter is an array. This will result in the `ops` parameter being pushed onto the `this.ops` array without being processed, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `ops` parameter is not an array. This will result in the `ops` parameter being processed as an array, even if it is not, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops instanceof Array
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `ops` parameter is not an array. This will result in the `ops` parameter being processed as an array, even if it is not, which could lead to unexpected
