  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function expects two arguments, but only one is provided. The resulting value would be `NaN`, which would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function expects two arguments, but only one is provided. The resulting value would be `NaN`, which would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function expects two arguments, but only one is provided. The resulting value would be `NaN`, which would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
