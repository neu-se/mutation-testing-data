 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `linkurl_path` starts with `pageurl_path`, instead of checking if `pageurl_path` includes `linkurl_path`. This change would affect cases where the `linkurl_path` is a substring of `pageurl_path` but not at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.indexOf(linkurl_path) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `pageurl_path` contains `linkurl_path` using the `indexOf` method, instead of using the `includes` method. This change would affect cases where the `linkurl_path` is a substring of `pageurl_path`, but the `includes` method is not supported (e.g., in older browsers).
