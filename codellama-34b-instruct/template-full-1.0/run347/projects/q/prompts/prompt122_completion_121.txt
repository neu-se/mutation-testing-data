  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ key1: value2, key2: value1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the properties of the object are swapped, which could potentially break code that relies on the specific properties being in a certain order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the object now has an additional property, which could break code that relies on the specific properties being present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ key1: { nestedKey: value1 }, key2: value2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the object now contains a nested object, which could break code that relies on the specific structure of the object.

DONE.
