  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called on the `newOp` object, which is a new object created by the `cloneDeep` function, rather than the original `newOp` object. This would cause the `insert` method to be called on a different object than the original code, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` property of the `newOp` object is accessed, rather than the `newOp` object itself. This would cause the `ops` property to be accessed on a different object than the original code, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object is accessed, rather than the `newOp` object itself. This would cause the `
