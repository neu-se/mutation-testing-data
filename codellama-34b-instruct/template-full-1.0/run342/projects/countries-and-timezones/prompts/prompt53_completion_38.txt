  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(timezones).map(getTimezone)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(timezones)` would return an array of keys, rather than an object, and `map` would not be able to access the corresponding values in the `timezones` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(timezones).forEach(getTimezone)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(timezones)` would return an array of values, rather than an object, and `forEach` would not be able to access the corresponding keys in the `timezones` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(timezones).map(getTimezone)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries(timezones)` would return an array of key-value pairs, rather than an object, and `map` would not be able to
