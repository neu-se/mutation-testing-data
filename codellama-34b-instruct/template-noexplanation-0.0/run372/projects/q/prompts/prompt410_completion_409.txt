  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect()
```
This change will cause the `nearer` function to return the fulfillment value of the promise, rather than the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.call(value)
```
This change will cause the `nearer` function to return the fulfillment value of the promise, rather than the promise itself. It is similar to Option 1, but it uses the `call` method to invoke the `inspect` method on the `value` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.apply(value)
```
This change will cause the `nearer` function to return the fulfillment value of the promise, rather than the promise itself. It is similar to Option 2, but it uses the `apply` method to invoke the `inspect` method on the `value` object.

DONE.
