  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op['length']
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op['length']` is an invalid syntax and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.length` is a different value than `Op.length`, and it would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the `this.ops` array, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
