  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.insert` property is not defined, while `otherOp.delete` is defined. This would cause the `transform` method to throw an error when trying to access the `insert` property of `otherOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.retain` property is not defined, while `otherOp.delete` is defined. This would cause the `transform` method to throw an error when trying to access the `retain` property of `otherOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.attributes` property is not defined, while `otherOp.delete` is defined. This would cause the `transform` method to throw an error when trying to access the `attributes` property of `otherOp`.
