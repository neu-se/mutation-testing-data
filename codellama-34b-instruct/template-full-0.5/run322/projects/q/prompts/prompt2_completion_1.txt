  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a function as an argument, but a string is provided instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a function as an argument, but an arrow function is provided instead, which is a different type of function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a function as an argument, but a function that logs to the console is provided instead, which has a different purpose.

DONE.
