  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to return an empty object, rather than an object containing the inverted attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<empty string>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to return an empty string, rather than an object containing the inverted attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to return `null`, rather than an object containing the inverted attributes.

DONE.
