  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a distinct variable from `b`, and using it instead of `b` would cause the `Math.abs()` function to operate on a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a constant value, and using it instead of the variable `b` would cause the `Math.abs()` function to always return `0`, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<statement>
```
This would result in different behavior because `<statement>` is a complete JavaScript statement, and using it instead of the variable `b` would cause the `Math.abs()` function to execute a different operation, potentially resulting in a different outcome.

DONE.
