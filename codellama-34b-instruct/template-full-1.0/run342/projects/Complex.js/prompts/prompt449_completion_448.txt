  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a different value for the `d` variable, since `a` and `this['im']` may not be equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a different value for the `d` variable, since `b` and `this['im']` may not be equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a different value for the `d` variable, since `a` and `b` may not be equal to `this['im']`.

DONE.
