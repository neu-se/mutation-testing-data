Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the addition of the squares of `a` and `b` to a subtraction, which could lead to negative results when `b` is greater than `a`, affecting the calculation of the hypotenuse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(a, 3) + Math.pow(b, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from the sum of squares to the sum of cubes, which will yield significantly larger values for `a` and `b` greater than 1, thus affecting the final result of the hypotenuse.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) + Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the calculation of the hypotenuse with the simple sum of the absolute values of `a` and `b`, which does not account for the geometric relationship between the two sides of a right triangle.

DONE.
