  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ }
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object would be returned, instead of an object with the expected `filename` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'wrong-file-name' }
```
This would result in different behavior because a different file name would be returned, instead of the expected file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, extraProperty: 'foo' }
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra property would be returned, which is not expected in the original code.

DONE.
