  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced regex pattern would match a different set of strings. The original pattern matches a byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, while the new pattern matches a space character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced regex pattern would match a different set of strings. The original pattern matches a BOM at the beginning of the string, while the new pattern matches a string that is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced regex pattern would match a different set of strings. The original pattern matches a BOM at the beginning of the string, while the new pattern matches a string that is null.

DONE.
