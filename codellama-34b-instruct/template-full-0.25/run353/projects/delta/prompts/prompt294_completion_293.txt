  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the current element and return the next one, which could cause the loop to miss an iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would go back to the previous element and return it, which could cause the loop to repeat an iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would jump to the next element that is twice the current index, which could cause the loop to skip over elements.

DONE.
