  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method would not be called with a reason, and the promise would not be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method would not be called with a reason, and the promise would not be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method would be called with the string "error" as the reason, and the promise would be rejected with the string "error".

DONE.
