  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > start
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over a different range of indices.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= start
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over a different range of indices.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= start
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over a different range of indices.

DONE.
