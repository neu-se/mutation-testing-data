  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === null || longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` are not numbers, while the new code fragment checks if they are null. If the `latitude` or `longitude` is null, the constructor will throw an error, even if they are valid numbers.

DONE.
