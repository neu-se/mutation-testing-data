  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === '.jpg'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not equal to '.jpg', while this new code fragment checks if the file extension is equal to '.jpg'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) !== '.jpg'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not equal to '.jpg', while this new code fragment checks if the file extension is not equal to '.jpg'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === '.png'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not equal to '.jpg', while this new code fragment checks if the file extension is equal to '.png'.

DONE.
