  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `remove` is a different method than `delete`, and it may not have the same functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key being deleted is now different from the original key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key, true]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `delete` is now `true`, which means that the deletion will be performed unconditionally, regardless of whether the key exists or not.

DONE.
