  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always delete the entire remaining document, regardless of the structure of the document or the characteristics of the deletion operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always delete the entire document, regardless of the structure of the document or the characteristics of the deletion operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always delete the entire other document, regardless of the structure of the other document or the characteristics of the deletion operation.

DONE.
