  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter would be divided by 2, which would cause the stringified JSON to have half as many spaces as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter would be decremented by 1, which would cause the stringified JSON to have one fewer space than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter would be incremented by 1, which would cause the stringified JSON to have one more space than the original code fragment.

DONE.
