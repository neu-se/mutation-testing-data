Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Empty lines are acceptable in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because it suggests that empty lines do not indicate a problem, potentially leading to silent failures when loading data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly emits a 'load' event with a count of 0, which may mislead listeners into thinking the database is empty rather than indicating an error with the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Corrupted row detected')
```
This would result in different behavior because it generalizes the error message, which could obscure the specific issue of empty lines, making it harder to diagnose the actual problem in the database.

DONE.
