 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks for the 'delete' type, ignoring other possible types like 'retain' or custom types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' || thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it only considers 'insert' and 'delete' operations, ignoring other possible types like 'retain' or custom types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' || thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for any operation with a positive length, which may not accurately represent a 'delete' operation.

DONE.
