  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument in the `array_slice` call, which could cause problems if the function relies on that argument for its functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, arguments.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last argument from the `array_slice` call, which could cause problems if the function expects that argument to be present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, +Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with an infinite number of elements to the `array_slice` call, which could cause problems if the function relies on a finite number of arguments for its functionality.

DONE.
