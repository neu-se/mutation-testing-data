  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method returns a boolean indicating whether there are more elements in the iterator, whereas `!this.hasNext()` returns the opposite boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.index` is the current index of the iterator, and `this.ops.length` is the total number of elements in the iterator. If the iterator has not reached the end, `this.index` will be less than `this.ops.length`, but if the iterator has reached the end, `this.index` will be equal to `this.ops.length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peek() !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.peek()` returns the next element in the iterator, or `undefined` if there are no more elements. If the
