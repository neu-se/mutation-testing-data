  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be called recursively, potentially leading to a stack overflow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(pageurl, linkurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be called with the arguments in reverse order, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, linkurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be called with the same argument twice, potentially leading to different results.

DONE.
