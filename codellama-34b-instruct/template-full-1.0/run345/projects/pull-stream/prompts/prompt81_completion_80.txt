  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof err === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `err` is a function, while the new code checks if `err` is an object. This change could potentially cause the `if` statement to evaluate to true when it should be false, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err instanceof Error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `err` is an instance of the Error class, while the new code checks if `err` is an object. This change could potentially cause the `if` statement to evaluate to true when it should be false, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `err` is undefined, while the new code checks if `err` is an object. This change could potentially cause the `if` statement to evaluate to true when it should be false, leading
