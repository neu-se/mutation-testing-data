  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.substr(1,1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.substr(1,1)` extracts the second character of the string `a`, while `a['r']` accesses the property `r` of the object `a` (if `a` is an object).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.charCodeAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `b.charCodeAt(0)` returns the Unicode value of the first character of string `b`, while `a['r']` accesses the property `r` of the object `a` (if `a` is an object).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an object and does not have properties, while `a['r']` accesses the property `r` of the object `a` (if `a` is
