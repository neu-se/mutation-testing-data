  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" || typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because if `process` is not an object or `process.emit` is not a function, the `process.emit` function will not be called, even if it exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because if `process` is not an object and `process.emit` is a function, the `process.emit` function will not be called, even if it exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" || typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because if `process` is an object or `process.emit` is not a function, the `process.emit` function will not be called, even if it exists.

DONE.
