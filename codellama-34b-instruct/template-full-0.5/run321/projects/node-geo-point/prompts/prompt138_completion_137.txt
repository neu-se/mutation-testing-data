  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which could cause errors in the calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the longitude value, which could cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the longitude value by 2, which could cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
