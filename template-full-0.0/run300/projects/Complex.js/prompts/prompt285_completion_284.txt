  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the cosh function to return the opposite value, which would affect the calculation of the complex number's magnitude and angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would cause the cosh function to return a different value, which would affect the calculation of the complex number's magnitude and angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sinh function would return a different value than the cosh function, which would affect the calculation of the complex number's magnitude and angle.

DONE.
