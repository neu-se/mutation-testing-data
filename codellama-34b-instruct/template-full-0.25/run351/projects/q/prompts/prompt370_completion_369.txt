  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that handles the rejection of the promise, whereas `_progressed` is a function that handles the progress of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that handles the fulfillment of the promise, whereas `_progressed` is a function that handles the progress of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that handles the progress of the promise, whereas `_fulfilled` and `_rejected` are functions that handle the fulfillment and rejection of the promise, respectively.

DONE.
