  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super.set
```
This would result in a different behavior because `super.set` would call the set method of the parent class of `PolicyMap`, whereas `this.set` would call the set method of `PolicyMap` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set.bind
```
This would result in a different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function with a specific `this` value and zero or more arguments, whereas `set` is a method that sets a property of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super.set.call
```
This would result in a different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, whereas `super.set` would call the set method of the parent class of `PolicyMap` and `this.set` would call the set method of `PolicyMap` itself.

DONE.
