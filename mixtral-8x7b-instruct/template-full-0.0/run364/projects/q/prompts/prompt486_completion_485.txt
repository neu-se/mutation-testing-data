 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it disables tracking of unhandled rejections, which is different from the original `resetUnhandledRejections` function that resets the state of unhandled rejections and allows tracking to be enabled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
trackUnhandledRejections = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable to `undefined`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code that relies on this variable being a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delete Q.resetUnhandledRejections;
```
This would result in different behavior because it deletes the `resetUnhandledRejections` function from the `Q` object, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior when other parts of the code try to call this function.
