  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `iter.peek()` returns the next operation itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `iter.peek()` returns the next operation itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek(0)` returns the first operation in the iterator, while `iter.peek()` returns the next operation.

DONE.
