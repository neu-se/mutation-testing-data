  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm
```
This would result in different behavior because `rm` is a method that removes a key and its value from the database, whereas `set` is a method that sets a key and its value in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is a method that retrieves a value from the database, whereas `set` is a method that sets a key and its value in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.update
```
This would result in different behavior because `update` is a method that updates a value in the database, whereas `set` is a method that sets a key and its value in the database.

DONE.
