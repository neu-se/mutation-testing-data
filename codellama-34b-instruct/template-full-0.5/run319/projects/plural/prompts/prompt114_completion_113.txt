  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return 'games'; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "games", regardless of the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an "i" to the end of the word, regardless of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add "es" to the end of the word, regardless of the input word.

DONE.
