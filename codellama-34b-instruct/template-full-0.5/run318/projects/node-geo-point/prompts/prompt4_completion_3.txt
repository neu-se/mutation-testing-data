  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to `'Point'`. In the original code, the `type` property is checked to be equal to `'Point'`, so this change would cause the code to behave differently for objects with a different `type` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property of the `point` object does not have a length of 2. In the original code, the `coordinates` property is checked to have a length of 2, so this change would cause the code to behave differently for objects with a different number of coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0] !== point.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would
