  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` expects an object as its first argument, but `obj.toString()` returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toJSON()
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` expects an object as its first argument, but `obj.toJSON()` returns a JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` expects an object as its first argument, but `obj.valueOf()` returns a primitive value.

DONE.
