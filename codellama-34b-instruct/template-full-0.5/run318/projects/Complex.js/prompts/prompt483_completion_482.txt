  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] !== 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is less than `0`, while this code fragment checks if `this['im']` is not equal to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] !== 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to `0`, while this code fragment checks if `this['re']` is not equal to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] === 0 && this['re'] === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is less than `0`, while this code fragment checks if `this['im']` is equal to `0` and `this['re']` is equal to `0`.

DONE.
