  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the variable assigned to the result of the `atan2` function, whereas `b` is the second argument passed to the function. Using `a` instead of `b` would give a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `b` and would give a different result when divided by `d`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / d
```
This would result in different behavior because `b / d` is a different expression than `a / d` and would give a different result when divided by `d`.

DONE.
