  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, even if `places` is undefined or null, which could cause the `Math.pow` function to return NaN instead of a valid number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ? 0 : 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1 if `places` is undefined or null, which could cause the `Math.pow` function to return a non-zero value instead of NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1 if `places` is undefined or null, which could cause the `Math.pow` function to return a non-zero value instead of NaN.

DONE.
