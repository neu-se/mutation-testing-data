 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment (`request`) returns a promise that resolves with the image data, while this change resolves the promise immediately without any data. The developers' test suite should include checks for the actual image data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment (`request`) returns a promise, while this change returns an empty object. The developers' test suite should include checks for the returned promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment (`request`) returns a promise, while this change returns a function that does nothing. The developers' test suite should include checks for the returned promise.

DONE.
