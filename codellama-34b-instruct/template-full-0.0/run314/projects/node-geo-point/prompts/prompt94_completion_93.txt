  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos(sinφ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` returns the arccosine of a number, which is the angle in radians whose cosine is that number. In this case, `sinφ2` is the sine of the angular distance between the two points, so `Math.acos(sinφ2)` would return the angular distance between the two points, which is not what we want.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin(sinφ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` returns the arcsine of a number, which is the angle in radians whose sine is that number. In this case, `sinφ2` is the sine of the angular distance between the two points, so `Math.asin(sinφ2)` would return the angular distance between the two points, which is not what we want.
