  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `*` operator, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator is used instead of the `+` operator, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator is used instead of the `+` operator, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
