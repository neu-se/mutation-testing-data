Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ strict: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be called with a different options object, potentially changing the way it identifies glob patterns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be called with an empty options object, which might have different default settings than the original `{ strict: false }` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function would be called with `null` as its second argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors, as the function might not be designed to handle `null` options.

DONE.
