  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile.bind(null, file))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `fs.readFile` method into a callback-style function, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile.bind(null, file, options))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `fs.readFile` method into a callback-style function with the `options` object as the second parameter, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile.bind(null, file, options, callback))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `fs.readFile` method into a callback-style function with the `options` object as the second parameter and a `callback` function
