  Mutation testing is a basic software testing approach used to find defective areas in a program's test suite by making careful changes to the program's code. The testing suite should fail as a result of the changes performed, saying that the tests may not be as effective as the developers may have hoped and a starting point for enhancing the test suite.

The fenced code blocks below illustrate three alternate code fragments that could be put in for PLACEHOLDER to produce various unique behavior.

Option 1: change the PLACEHOLDER to:
```
result[country].current.push(undefined)
```
As a result of the changes made, this code fragment results in different behavior since it would add an additional, undefined element to the country's 'current' property rather than pushing the timezone's ID.

Option 2: change the PLACEHOLDER to:
```
result[country].current.push("0")
```
 Because this code fragment results in different behavior in that it would add the string "0" rather than the expected timezone ID to the country's 'current' property, this code fragment results in different behavior than
