Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.slice(0, 1), options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first timezone instead of all available timezones, potentially omitting important data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(timezones), options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezone objects instead of an object, changing the structure of the returned data and possibly breaking any code that expects an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of the timezones, leading to a loss of all timezone data and potentially causing errors in any subsequent operations that rely on that data.

DONE.
