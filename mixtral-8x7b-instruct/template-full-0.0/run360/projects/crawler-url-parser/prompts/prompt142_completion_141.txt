 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not remove any trailing slashes or file extensions from the pageurl\_path, potentially causing incorrect URL type determination in the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of pageurl\_path instead of removing the trailing slash and file extension, potentially causing incorrect URL type determination in the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^\/]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last path segment and any following slashes instead of just the trailing slash, potentially causing incorrect URL type determination in the `gettype` function.

DONE.
