Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` computes the square root of a number, which is not equivalent to the absolute value, potentially leading to incorrect results in calculations that depend on the magnitude of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer, which would change the value of `x` to an integer, affecting the calculations that rely on the precise value of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1 * x
```
This would result in different behavior because negating `x` would invert its sign, leading to incorrect results in calculations that expect the original value of `x` to be used in the computation.

DONE.
