  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[^\uFEFF]/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character that is not the UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark), while the new code fragment matches any character that is not the UTF-8 BOM or the start of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the UTF-8 BOM only if it is at the start of the string, while the new code fragment matches one or more UTF-8 BOM characters at the start of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[^\uFEFF]*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character that is not the UTF-8 BOM, while the new code fragment matches any sequence of characters that do not include the UTF-8 BOM.

DONE.
