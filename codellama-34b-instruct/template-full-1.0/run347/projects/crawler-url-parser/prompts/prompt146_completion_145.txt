  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the pattern `/index\.[a-z]+$/` while the new code fragment matches the pattern `/default\.[a-z]+$/`, which may not capture all the desired URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace()` method to remove the last part of the path, while the new code fragment uses the `replace()` method to remove the last part of the path and the file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace()` method to remove the last part of the path
