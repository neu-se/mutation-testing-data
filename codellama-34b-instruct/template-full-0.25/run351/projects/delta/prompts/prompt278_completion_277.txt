  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `start` variable to be initialized to a different value than the original code, which could affect the logic of the `eachLine` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) + iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `start` variable to be initialized to a different value than the original code, which could affect the logic of the `eachLine` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) * iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `start` variable to be initialized to a different value than the original code, which could affect the logic of the `eachLine` method.

DONE.
