  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the operation onto the line, while the suggested code deletes it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(0, index).push
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the operation onto the line, while the suggested code slices the line at the index and then pushes the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta(line.ops).push
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the operation onto the line, while the suggested code creates a new Delta with the line's ops and then pushes the operation onto the new Delta.
DONE.
