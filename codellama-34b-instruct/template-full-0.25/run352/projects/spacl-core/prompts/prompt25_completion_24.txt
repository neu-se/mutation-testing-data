  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && !opt && min < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!opt` check would invert the result of the `opt` check, potentially causing the `min < 1` check to be evaluated when it should not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && opt && min > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min > 1` check would be evaluated even when `opt` is false, potentially causing the `min < 1` check to be skipped when it should not be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && opt && min === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min === 1` check would be evaluated even when `opt` is false, potentially causing the `min < 1` check to be skipped when it should not be.

DONE.
