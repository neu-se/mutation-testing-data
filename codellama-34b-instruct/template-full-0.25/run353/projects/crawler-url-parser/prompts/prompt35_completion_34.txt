  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would remove the first character of the string, potentially changing the URL that is parsed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would convert the string to uppercase, potentially changing the URL that is parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the string, potentially changing the URL that is parsed.

DONE.
