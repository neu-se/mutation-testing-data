  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a country object with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, which would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { allTimezones: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a country object with the `allTimezones` property set to `true`, which would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to return an array of all timezones for the country, regardless of whether they are deprecated or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { timezones: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a country object with the `timezones` property set to `true`, which would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry`
