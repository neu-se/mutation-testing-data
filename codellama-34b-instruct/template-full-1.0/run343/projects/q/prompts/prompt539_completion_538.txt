  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` 
returns a promise object even if the resolved value is an undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Q.resolve(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is 
 the alias of `Promise.resolve` which directly returns the 
resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.map(function(value){
return Q(value)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.map` 
iterates over the elements of the array and returns a new 
array containing the mapped values. 

DONE.
