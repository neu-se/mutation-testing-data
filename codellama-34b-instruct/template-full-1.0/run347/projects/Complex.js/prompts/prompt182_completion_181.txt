  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](0)
```
This would result in different behavior because before, the `isZero` method was checking if the complex number was equal to zero, but now it's only checking if the real part is equal to zero, which could lead to false positives.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.real() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because before, the `isZero` method was checking if the complex number was equal to zero, but now it's only checking if the real part is equal to zero, which could lead to false negatives.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.imaginary() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because before, the `isZero` method was checking if the complex number was equal to zero, but now it's only checking if the imaginary part is equal to zero, which could lead to false positives.

DONE.
