  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value returned by `iter.hasNext()`, causing the loop to terminate early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasPrevious()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.hasPrevious()` checks if there are any previous elements in the iteration, rather than checking if there are any next elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType()` returns the type of the next element in the iteration, and the loop would terminate early if the next element is not an insertion.

DONE.
