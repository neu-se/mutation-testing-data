  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will return a rejected promise, whereas `Q(result.value)` will return a resolved promise with the value of `result.value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` will return a resolved promise, whereas `Q(result.value)` will return a resolved promise with the value of `result.value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` will return a promise that is resolved with the value of `result.value`, whereas `Q(result.value)` will return a resolved promise with the value of `result.value`.

DONE.
