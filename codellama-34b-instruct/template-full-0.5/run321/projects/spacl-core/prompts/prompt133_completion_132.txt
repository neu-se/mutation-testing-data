  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `this.verbs` returns the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the original array with the arguments, while `this.verbs` returns the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array that contains only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `this.verbs` returns the original array.

DONE.
