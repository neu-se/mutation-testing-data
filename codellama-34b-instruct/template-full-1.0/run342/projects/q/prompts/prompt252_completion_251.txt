  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.reject.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that rejects the promise, whereas `promiseDispatch` is a method that dispatches the promise. Replacing `promiseDispatch` with `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected rather than dispatched, which would likely result in different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.resolve.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method that resolves the promise, whereas `promiseDispatch` is a method that dispatches the promise. Replacing `promiseDispatch` with `resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved rather than dispatched, which would likely result in different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.tolute.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `tolute` is not a valid method for a promise
