  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects the context object as the first argument, but `null` is passed instead. This would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f.apply(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects the context object as the first argument, but `undefined` is passed instead. This would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f.bind(null)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with the context object bound to it, but in this case, `null` is passed instead of a function. This would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

DONE.
