  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = [undefined, []];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` variable would always be an empty array, even if the `Dirty` object has callbacks registered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = [null, []];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable would always be `null`, even if the `Dirty` object has a key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = [this._data.get(key), []];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` variable would always be an empty array, even if the `Dirty` object has callbacks registered. Additionally, the `key` variable would be set to the value of the `key` property of the `this._data` object, which may not be the same as the key that was passed to
