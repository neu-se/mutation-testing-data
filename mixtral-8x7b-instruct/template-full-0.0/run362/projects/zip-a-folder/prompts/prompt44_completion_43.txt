 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
zipArchive.bulk([{ src, dest: '/' }])
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a file named after the `src` variable directly to the root of the archive, instead of adding the directory and its contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
zipArchive.directory(src, '/', { mode: 0o777 })
