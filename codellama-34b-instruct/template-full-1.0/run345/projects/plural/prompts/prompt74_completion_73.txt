  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'die')
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `addRule` function is a string that should be the plural form of the first argument, which is not the case in this code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `addRule` function is a function that returns the plural form of the first argument, which is not the case in this code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `addRule` function is a string that should be the plural form of the first argument, and it is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
