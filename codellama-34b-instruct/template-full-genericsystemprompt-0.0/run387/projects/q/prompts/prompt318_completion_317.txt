  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is a different object than `Promise.prototype`, and the code would likely fail to work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.prototype` is a different object than `Promise.prototype`, and the code would likely fail to work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype` is a different object than `Promise.prototype`, and the code would likely fail to work as intended.

DONE.
