  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance += 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `distance` variable would be modified before the `calculateDestination` method is called, which could affect the calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance *= 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `distance` variable would be multiplied by 2 before the `calculateDestination` method is called, which could affect the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `distance` variable would be set to 0 before the `calculateDestination` method is called, which would cause the method to return a destination point with a distance of 0 from the original point, regardless of the value of the `bearing` variable.

DONE.
