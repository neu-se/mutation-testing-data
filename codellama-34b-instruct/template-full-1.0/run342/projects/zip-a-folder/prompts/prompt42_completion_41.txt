  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an array of all the files in the archive, while `glob()` returns a list of files that match a pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(globPart, false, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the first file that matches the glob pattern, while the original code adds all files that match the pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file(`${globPart}.zip`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a zip file with the same name as the glob pattern, while the original code adds all files that match the pattern.

DONE.
