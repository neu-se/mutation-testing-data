Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the exponential term, potentially leading to incorrect results in the calculation of the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the negated value, which alters the output of the function and could lead to incorrect results in the context of hyperbolic calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the negated value by 2, which would significantly change the output of the hyperbolic cosine function, potentially leading to erroneous results.

DONE.
