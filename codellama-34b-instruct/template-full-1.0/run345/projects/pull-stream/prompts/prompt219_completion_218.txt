  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb` which would call the `cb` function with the data argument, while `null` would be a no-op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb` which would call the `cb` function with the data argument, while `undefined` would be a no-op and not call the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb` which would call the `cb` function with the data argument, while `0` would be a falsy value and not call the `cb` function.

DONE.
