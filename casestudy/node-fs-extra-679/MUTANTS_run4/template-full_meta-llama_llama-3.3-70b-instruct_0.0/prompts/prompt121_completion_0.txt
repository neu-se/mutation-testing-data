Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent!== srcParent && destParent!== path.parse(destParent).root
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the original condition, causing the function to continue checking parent paths even when the destination parent is the same as the source parent or the root path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent === src
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the destination parent path with the source path instead of the source parent path, potentially causing the function to stop checking parent paths prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
srcParent === path.parse(srcParent).root
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the source parent path is the root path, ignoring the comparison with the destination parent path, which could lead to incorrect results when the destination parent is the same as the source parent but not the root path.

DONE.
