 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is being replaced with the `values` method, which returns an array of an object's own enumerable string-keyed property values, rather than an array of the object's keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"keys", ["toString"]
