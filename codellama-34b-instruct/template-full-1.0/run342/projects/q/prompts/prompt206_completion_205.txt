  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first element of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array, which may not exist or may not contain the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.match(/\((.+):\d+:\d+\)/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the file name and line number from the stack trace line, rather than checking the entire line for the `@` symbol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(stackLine.substring(stackLine.indexOf("@")))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the entire stack trace line, rather than just the first line, for the `@` symbol.

DONE.
