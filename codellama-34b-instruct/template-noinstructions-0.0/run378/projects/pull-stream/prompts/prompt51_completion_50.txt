  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `source` method on the `s` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` method on the `s` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` method on the `source` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
