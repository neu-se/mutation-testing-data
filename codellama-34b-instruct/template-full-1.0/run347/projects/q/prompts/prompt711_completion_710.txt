  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"valueOf"
```
This would result in different behavior because "valueOf" is a different method than "keys" and would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"toString"
```
This would result in different behavior because "toString" is a different method than "keys" and would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because "length" is a different property than "keys" and would return a different value.

DONE.
