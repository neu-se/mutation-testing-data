  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match the word "woman" in all cases, e.g., "woMan".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an "s" to the end of the word regardless of the number of syllables, e.g., "woman" would become "womans".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.slice(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last letter of the word and add "ies" to the end
