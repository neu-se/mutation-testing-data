  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetFilePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.promises.access` method is being called with the `targetFilePath` variable, which is the path to the target file being zipped, instead of the `src` variable, which is the path to the source folder being zipped. This would cause the method to check the permissions of the target file instead of the source folder, which could potentially result in different behavior if the permissions are different for the two files.

DONE.
