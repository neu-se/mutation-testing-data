Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving with the value of the first fulfilled promise, it resolves with `null`, which could lead to incorrect handling of the promise's result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises[index]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves with the promise at the current index instead of the first resolved promise, potentially leading to incorrect results if the promises are not in the expected order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Promise rejected"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the promise to be rejected with a new error message instead of resolving with the fulfilled value, which contradicts the intended functionality of returning the first resolved promise.

DONE.
