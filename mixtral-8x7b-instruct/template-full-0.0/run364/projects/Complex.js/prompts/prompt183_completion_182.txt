 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now return a result when the exponent is an imaginary number, whereas the original code fragment correctly checks if the exponent is a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
