  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a protocol at the beginning of the URL, while the new code fragment only checks for the presence of the string "http".

DONE.
