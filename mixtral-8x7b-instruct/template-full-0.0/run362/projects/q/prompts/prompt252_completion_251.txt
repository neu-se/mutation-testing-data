 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` passes arguments differently than `apply`. `apply` passes arguments as an array, while `call` passes arguments separately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newPromise.promiseDispatch()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass any arguments to `promiseDispatch`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newPromise.someOtherMethod
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference a non-existent method on the `newPromise` object.

DONE.
