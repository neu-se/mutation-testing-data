  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but `err` is only one argument. This would cause the function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but `null` is not a valid value for the first argument. This would cause the function to be called with an invalid argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but `null` is not a valid value for the second argument. This would cause the function to be called with an invalid argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
