  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with `false` instead of the default `true`, which means that the archive will not be finalized and the promise will not be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize('abc')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with an invalid argument, which would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with `null` instead of the default `true`, which means that the archive will not be finalized and the promise will not be resolved.

DONE.
