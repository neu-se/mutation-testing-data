  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is now starting from the third element instead of the second, which would cause the generated regex to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the join method is now being used to concatenate the reversed array elements with a '/' separator, which would cause the generated regex to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map((x) => x.replace(/^:/, ''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the map method is now being used to remove any leading ':' characters from the array elements, which would cause the generated regex to be different.

DONE.
