  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would not be called, and the unhandled rejection would not be forwarded to the `Q.onerror` handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would not be called, and the unhandled rejection would not be forwarded to the `Q.onerror` handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with the `Q.onerror` function as an argument, and the unhandled rejection would be forwarded to the `Q.onerror` handler.

DONE.
