Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` will round the number to the nearest integer, potentially changing the value significantly compared to `parseFloat`, which converts the string to a floating-point number without rounding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` converts the string to an integer, discarding any decimal part, which can lead to a loss of precision compared to `parseFloat`, which retains the decimal values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1]))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` will always return a non-negative number, which could change the sign of the value derived from the string, unlike `parseFloat`, which retains the original sign.

DONE.
