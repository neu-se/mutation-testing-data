  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude as the first argument to the `toTile` function, which is not what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude as the first argument to the `toTile` function, which is not what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom, this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude as the second argument to the `toTile` function, which is not what the original code does.

DONE.
