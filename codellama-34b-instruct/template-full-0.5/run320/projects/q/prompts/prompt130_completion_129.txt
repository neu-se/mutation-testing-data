  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operator would change the value of `key`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the `object_keys` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would not change the value of `key`, but would still potentially lead to unexpected behavior in the `object_keys` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator would change the value of `key`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the `object_keys` function.

DONE.
