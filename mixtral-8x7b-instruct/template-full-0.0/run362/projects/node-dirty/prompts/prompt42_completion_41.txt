 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function will receive `null` as the second argument instead of the actual value stored in the database. This could cause issues if the `fn` function is not designed to handle `null` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function will receive `0` as the second argument instead of the actual value stored in the database. This could cause issues if the `fn` function is not designed to handle numeric values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function will receive an empty object as the second argument instead of the actual value stored in the database. This could cause issues if the `fn` function is not designed to handle object values.

DONE.
