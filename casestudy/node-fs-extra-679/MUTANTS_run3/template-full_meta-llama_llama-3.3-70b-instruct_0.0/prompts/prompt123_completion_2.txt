Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the destination parent is the root path of the source, rather than the destination, potentially leading to incorrect results when checking for subdirectories.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.parse(src).root
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the destination parent is the root path of the source, rather than the destination, potentially leading to incorrect results when checking for subdirectories.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the destination parent is the root directory, rather than the root path of the destination, potentially leading to incorrect results when checking for subdirectories on non-Unix-like systems.

DONE.
