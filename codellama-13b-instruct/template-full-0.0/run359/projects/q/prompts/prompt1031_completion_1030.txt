  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, value
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to the nodeback function would be undefined, rather than null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the nodeback function would be undefined, rather than value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, value
```
This would result in different behavior because the nodeback function would be called with two identical arguments, rather than one argument being null and the other being value.

DONE.
