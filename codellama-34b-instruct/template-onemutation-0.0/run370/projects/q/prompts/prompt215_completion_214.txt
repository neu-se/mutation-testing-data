  
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.then` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `value` is a promise. The `isPromiseAlike` function checks if the value is a promise by checking if it has a `then` method, so replacing `value` with `value.then` would cause the function to return `true` even if the value is not a promise.
