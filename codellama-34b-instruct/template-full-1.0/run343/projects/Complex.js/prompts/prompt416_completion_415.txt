  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the product of `a` and `b`, which may have different results than computing the square of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the square of `a` and then subtract 1, which may have different results than computing the square of `a` and adding 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a * a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the cube of `a` and then add 1, which may have different results than computing the square of `a` and adding 1.

DONE.
