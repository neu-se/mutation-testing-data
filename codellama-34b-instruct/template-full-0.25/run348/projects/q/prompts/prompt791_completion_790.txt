  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called, which means that the promise will not be rejected, even if the original promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called, which means that the promise will not be rejected, even if the original promise is rejected. Additionally, the `throw` statement will cause the promise to be rejected with the specified error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called, which means that the promise will not be rejected, even if the original promise is rejected. Additionally, the `deferred.reject` method will cause the promise to be rejected with the specified error.

DONE.
