  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the result of the `isNaN` and `isInfinite` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a constant value of 0 for the imaginary part, which would cause the `isNaN` and `isInfinite` functions to always return false.

DONE.
