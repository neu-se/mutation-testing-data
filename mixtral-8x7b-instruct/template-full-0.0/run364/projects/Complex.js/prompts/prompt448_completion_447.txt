 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` always rounds down to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` always rounds up to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying the real and imaginary parts would not round the imaginary part to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.round` would.

DONE.
