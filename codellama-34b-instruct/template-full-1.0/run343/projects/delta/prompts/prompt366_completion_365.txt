  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.nextType
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextType` function returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, but the `peekType` function returns the type of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.nextType === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextType` function returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, but the `peekType` function returns the type of the current operation. Additionally, the `nextType` function does not have the same side effects as the `peekType` function, which can cause changes in the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` function returns the length of the current operation, but the `peekType` function returns the type of the current operation. Additionally, the `peekLength` function
