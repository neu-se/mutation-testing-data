  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] = -this['im'];
this['im'] = tmp;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment swaps the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while the new code fragment only swaps the real part with the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] = -this['im'];
this['im'] = -tmp;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment swaps the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while the new code fragment swaps the real part with the negative of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] = tmp;
this['im'] = -this['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment swaps the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while the new code fragment swaps the real part with the negative of the real part.
