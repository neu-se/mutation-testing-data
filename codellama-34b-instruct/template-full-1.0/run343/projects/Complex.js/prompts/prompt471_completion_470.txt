  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider only non-negative imaginary parts, while the original code considers imaginary parts of any sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider only non-positive imaginary parts, while the original code considers imaginary parts of any sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['im']) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider only imaginary parts with absolute value greater than a small positive number, while the original code considers imaginary parts of any absolute value.

DONE.
