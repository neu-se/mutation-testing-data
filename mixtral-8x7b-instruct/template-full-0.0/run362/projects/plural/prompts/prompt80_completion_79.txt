 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a different plural form for the word 'goose'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return 'gooses' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a different plural form for the word 'goose', and the replacement code fragment always returns 'gooses' regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
