 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * timeout
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be twice as long as intended, causing the promise to resolve later than in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout - 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be shorter than intended, causing the promise to resolve earlier than in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout || 100
```
This would result in different behavior because if `timeout` is falsy (e.g. `0`, `null`, `undefined`), the delay would be a constant `100` instead of being omitted entirely.

DONE.
