  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `hasNext()` method to always return `true`, even if the iterator is at the end of the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `hasNext()` method to always return `false`, even if the iterator is not at the end of the list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `hasNext()` method to always return `true`, even if the iterator is at the end of the list, and would also cause the `next()` method to return twice as many elements as it should.

DONE.
