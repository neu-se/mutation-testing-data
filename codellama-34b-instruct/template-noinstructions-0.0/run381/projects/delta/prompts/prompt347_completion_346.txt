  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first character of the baseOpData, whereas the original code fragment considers the entire baseOpData.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second character of the baseOpData, whereas the original code fragment considers the entire baseOpData.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData.slice(0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first two characters of the baseOpData, whereas the original code fragment considers the entire baseOpData.

DONE.
