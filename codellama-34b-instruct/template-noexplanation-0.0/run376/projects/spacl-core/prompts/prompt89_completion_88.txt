  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name]
```
This change will cause the `PolicyMap` constructor to set the same value for both the key and the value of each policy, which may cause issues when trying to retrieve policies by name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, null]
```
This change will cause the `PolicyMap` constructor to set the value of each policy to `null`, which may cause issues when trying to retrieve policies by name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name.toUpperCase()]
```
This change will cause the `PolicyMap` constructor to set the value of each policy to the uppercase version of its name, which may cause issues when trying to retrieve policies by name.

DONE.
