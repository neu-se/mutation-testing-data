  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `resolve` option set to `true`, which means that the URL would not be resolved against the base URL. This could cause the `parse()` function to return a different result, which could in turn affect the behavior of the `extract()` function.

DONE.
