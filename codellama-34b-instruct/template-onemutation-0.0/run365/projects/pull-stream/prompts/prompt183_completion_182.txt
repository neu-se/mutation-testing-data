  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, while the new code fragment checks if the index `i` is strictly greater than the length of the array. This means that the new code fragment would not return the last element of the array if the length of the array is equal to the index `i`.

DONE.
