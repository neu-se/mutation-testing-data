  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the ! operator would negate the boolean value returned by getFileNameAndLineNumber(), potentially leading to incorrect filtering of stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof <PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the typeof operator would return a string indicating the type of the object returned by getFileNameAndLineNumber(), potentially leading to incorrect filtering of stack traces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because isNodeFrame() is a function that checks if a given stack line is generated by Node.js, and the code would not make sense in this context.

DONE.
