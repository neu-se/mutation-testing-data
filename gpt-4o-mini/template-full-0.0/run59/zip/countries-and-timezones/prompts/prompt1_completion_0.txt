Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the name is an empty string instead of checking if it is falsy (which would also include `null`, `undefined`, and other falsy values).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the name is not `null` instead of checking if it is falsy, which would allow for other falsy values like `undefined` or an empty string to pass through.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data.countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `countries` object does not have a property at the given `id`, rather than checking if the `name` variable itself is falsy, which could lead to different outcomes if the `countries` object is structured differently.

DONE.
