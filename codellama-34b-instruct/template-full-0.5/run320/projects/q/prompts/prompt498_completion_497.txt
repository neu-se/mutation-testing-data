  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `, "foo"` part would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called with three arguments instead of two, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, "foo", reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `"foo"` part would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called with a different value for the `reason` parameter, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo", reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection` parameter would be replaced with a string value, which would likely cause the `trackRejection` function to behave differently.

DONE.
