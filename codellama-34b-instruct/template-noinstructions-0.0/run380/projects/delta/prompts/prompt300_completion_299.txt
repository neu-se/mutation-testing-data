  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first character of the line and only consider the attributes of the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes || iter.next(1).attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the attributes of the first character, but then also consider the attributes of the second character, which may not be the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes || iter.next(2).attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the attributes of the first character, but then also consider the attributes of the second character, which may not be the same.

DONE.
