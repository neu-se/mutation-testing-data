  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be doubled, which could result in incorrect offsets or insertions in the text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be reduced by one, which could result in inserting the wrong amount of text or producing unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength ** 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be squared, which could produce unexpected results and offsets in the text. DONE.
