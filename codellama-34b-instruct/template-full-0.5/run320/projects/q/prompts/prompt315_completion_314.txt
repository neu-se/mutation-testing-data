  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `undefined` while this code checks for `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `undefined` while this code checks for the string "undefined".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `undefined` while this code checks for the return value of the `void` operator, which is `undefined`.

DONE.
