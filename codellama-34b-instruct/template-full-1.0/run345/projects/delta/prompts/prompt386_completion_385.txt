  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1, otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the first delta would be incremented by one, which would cause the `transform` method to produce an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1, otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the first delta would be decremented by one, which would cause the `transform` method to produce an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * otherIter.peekLength(), thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the first delta would be multiplied by the second delta, which would cause the `transform` method to produce an incorrect result.

DONE.
