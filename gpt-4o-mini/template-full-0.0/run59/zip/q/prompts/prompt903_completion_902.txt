Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise when an error occurs, it would incorrectly resolve the promise, leading to a successful state even when an error should have been propagated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Custom error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with a new custom error message, regardless of the original error that occurred, thus obscuring the actual reason for the failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a `null` value, which is not a valid error object, potentially causing confusion for any error handling logic that expects an `Error` instance.

DONE.
