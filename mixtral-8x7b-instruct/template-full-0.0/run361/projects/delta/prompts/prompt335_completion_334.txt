 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would no longer handle attributes correctly for the `retain` operation with an object value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<any>
```
This would result in different behavior because TypeScript's `any` type would suppress the type checking, and the `invert` method might not work as expected for the `retain` operation with an object value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op.attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use an empty object for the second argument of the `invert` method, potentially causing issues when the `baseOp.attributes` is not empty or `null`.

DONE.
