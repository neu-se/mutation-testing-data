  Sure, here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of `a[key]`, even if `b[key]` is not equal to `a[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `b[key]` is not `null`, even if `a[key]` is not equal to `b[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `a[key]` is equal to `b[key]`, even if `b[key]` is not equal to `a[key]`.

DONE.
