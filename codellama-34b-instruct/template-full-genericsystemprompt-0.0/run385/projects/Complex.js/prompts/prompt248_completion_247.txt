  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(a)` is a function that returns the value of `e^a - 1`, whereas `Math.expm1` is a function that returns the value of `e^x - 1` for any `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(a) - 1` is a function that returns the value of `e^a - 1`, whereas `Math.expm1` is a function that returns the value of `e^x - 1` for any `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a) - Math.exp(-a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(a) - Math.exp(-a)` is a function that returns the value
