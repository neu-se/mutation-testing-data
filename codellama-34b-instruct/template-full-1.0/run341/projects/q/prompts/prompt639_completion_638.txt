  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key is being used twice, which would cause the `delete` operation to delete the key twice, resulting in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` operation is being used instead of `delete`, which would cause the value to be updated instead of deleted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation is being used instead of `delete`, which would cause the value to be retrieved instead of deleted.

DONE.
