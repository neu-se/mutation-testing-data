  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the pathname of the parsed URL as the base URL, which may not be the same as the original base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the hostname of the parsed URL as the base URL, which may not be the same as the original base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol + '//' + parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the protocol and host of the parsed URL as the base URL, which may not be the same as the original base URL.

DONE.
