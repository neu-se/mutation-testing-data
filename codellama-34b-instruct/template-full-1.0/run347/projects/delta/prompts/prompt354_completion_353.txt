  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the wrong index resulting in incorrect transformation of indexes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex - length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the wrong index resulting in incorrect transformation of indexes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex;
```
This would result in correct behavior as the function would return the correct index.

DONE.
