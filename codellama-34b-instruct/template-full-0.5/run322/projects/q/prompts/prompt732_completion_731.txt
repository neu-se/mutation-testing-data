  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if `pendingCount` is less than 0, the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line would not be executed, and the promise would never be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if `pendingCount` is not equal to 0, the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line would not be executed, and the promise would never be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if `pendingCount` is greater than 0, the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line would not be executed, and the promise would never be resolved.

DONE.
