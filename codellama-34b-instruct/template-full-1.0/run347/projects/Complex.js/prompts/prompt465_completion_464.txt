  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'equals' method would always return true, regardless of the values of 're' and 'im'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'equals' method would compare the actual object to a complex number with the same real part as the current object, but with a different imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['PI']
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'equals' method would compare the actual object to a complex number with a real part equal to pi, but with a different imaginary part.

DONE.
