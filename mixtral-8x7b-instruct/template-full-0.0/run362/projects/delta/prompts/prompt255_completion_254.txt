 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `opLength` to be double the length of the next operation in the `otherIter`, instead of the minimum length between the current operation in `thisIter` and `otherIter`. This could cause the `diff()` method to process more or fewer operations than it should, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `opLength` to always be 0, effectively skipping the current operation in the `otherIter`. This could cause the `diff()` method to process fewer operations than it should, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `opLength` to be the length of the next operation in the `thisIter
