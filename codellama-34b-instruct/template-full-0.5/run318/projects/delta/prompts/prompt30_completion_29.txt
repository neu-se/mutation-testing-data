  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] || attr[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of the `&&` operator, which changes the logic of the condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== undefined && base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional condition `base[key] !== undefined` is added, which changes the logic of the condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] || attr[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of the `&&` operator, which changes the logic of the condition. Additionally, the `!==` operator is used instead of the `===` operator, which changes the logic of the condition.

DONE.
