  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` does not return a new array, while `map` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(Boolean).map
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter(Boolean)` removes all falsy values from the array, while the original code does not filter the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.map(v => v * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `v => v * 2` multiplies each element of the array by 2, while the original code does not modify the elements.

DONE.
