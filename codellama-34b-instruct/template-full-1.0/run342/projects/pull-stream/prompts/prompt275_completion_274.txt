  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is null before assigning it to the `_read` variable. By replacing it with `null`, the check will always fail, and the `stream` variable will never be assigned to `_read`, causing the `nextStream()` function to be called repeatedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is undefined before assigning it to the `_read` variable. By replacing it with `undefined`, the check will always pass, and the `stream` variable will always be assigned to `_read`, causing the `nextChunk()` function to be called repeatedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is a function before assigning it to the `_read` variable. By replacing it with an empty function
