  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, errback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is now called with the `errback` function as its first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function is not called in this case, which may cause the promise to be rejected without handling the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback, errback, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is added to the argument list of the `callback` function, which may cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
