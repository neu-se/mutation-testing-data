  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.entries()) {
```
This code fragment uses the `entries()` method to iterate over the key-value pairs in the `Map` object, which is more efficient than using a `for...of` loop with the `Map` object directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.keys()) {
```
This code fragment uses the `keys()` method to iterate over the keys in the `Map` object, which is more efficient than using a `for...of` loop with the `Map` object directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.values()) {
```
This code fragment uses the `values()` method to iterate over the values in the `Map` object, which is more efficient than using a `for...of` loop with the `Map` object directly.

DONE.
