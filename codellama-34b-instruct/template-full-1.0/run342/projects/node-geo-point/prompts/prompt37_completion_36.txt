  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point1Rad` variable is not defined in the code snippet, and the `rad2deg` function is not defined either.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point2Rad` variable is a number, and adding 1 to it would change its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point2Rad` variable is a number, and multiplying it by 2 would change its value.

DONE.
