  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1; index <= count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, and the loop condition would be less than or equal to `count` instead of less than `count`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count - 1; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop at `count - 1` instead of `count`, and the loop condition would be less than instead of less than or equal to.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count; index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment by 2 instead of 1, and the loop condition would be less than instead of less than or equal to.

DONE.
