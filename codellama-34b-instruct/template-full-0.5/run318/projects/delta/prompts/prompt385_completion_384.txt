  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the other iterator to peek at a longer length than the original code, which could result in different behavior when the iterator is used to transform the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the other iterator to peek at a shorter length than the original code, which could result in different behavior when the iterator is used to transform the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the other iterator to peek at a longer length than the original code, which could result in different behavior when the iterator is used to transform the delta.

DONE.
