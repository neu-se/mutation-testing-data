  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations, which could potentially result in different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the result, which could potentially result in different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations and the sign of the result, which could potentially result in different results.

DONE.
