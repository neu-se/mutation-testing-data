  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a
