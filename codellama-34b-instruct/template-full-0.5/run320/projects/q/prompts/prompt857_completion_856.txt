  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a different function from `clearTimeout`, and would not have the same effect on the timer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` would create a new timer, rather than clearing an existing one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear a different timer than the one that was originally set, and would not have the desired effect of canceling the timeout.

DONE.
