  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, errback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callback and errback functions is reversed, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the same callback function is used for both the success and failure cases, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, null, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the errback function is set to null, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected incorrectly.

DONE.
