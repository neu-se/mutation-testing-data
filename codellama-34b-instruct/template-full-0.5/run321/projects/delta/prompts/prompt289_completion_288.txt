  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the iterator by 2 instead of 1, potentially skipping over important data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the iterator by 1 instead of incrementing it, potentially returning incorrect data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next element in the iterator without advancing it, potentially causing an infinite loop.

DONE.
