  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that is called when the promise is rejected, whereas `then` is a method that is called when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that is called when the promise is either fulfilled or rejected, whereas `then` is only called when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that takes an array of promises and returns a new promise that is fulfilled when all of the input promises are fulfilled, whereas `then` is a method that is called when the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
