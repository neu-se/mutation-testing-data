Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the `opData` entirely, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operation's attributes during the inversion process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `opData` by adding 1, which could lead to an incorrect transformation of the operation, as it would not accurately reflect the original data being inverted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the handler to potentially fail or behave unexpectedly, as it would not receive the necessary data to perform the inversion correctly.

DONE.
