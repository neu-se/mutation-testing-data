Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calls the callback with a success status and a string 'error', which could lead to confusion in the handling of the callback response, as it suggests a successful operation instead of propagating the abort error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the parameters in the callback, passing the abort reason as the first argument and `null` as the second, which is contrary to the expected Node.js callback convention where the first argument should be an error (or `null` if no error occurred).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `abortCb` without any arguments, which could lead to a runtime error if `abortCb` is `undefined` or if it expects parameters, thus breaking the flow of the program when an abort occurs.

DONE.
