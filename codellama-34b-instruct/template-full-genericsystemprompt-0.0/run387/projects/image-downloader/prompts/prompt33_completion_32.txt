  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.resume()` would consume the response data, freeing up memory, but it would also cause the response to be consumed, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the response is expected to be used later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.destroy()` would destroy the response object, making it unusable for further processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.unpipe();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.unpipe()` would detach the response object from the write stream, making it impossible to write the response data to the file.

DONE.
