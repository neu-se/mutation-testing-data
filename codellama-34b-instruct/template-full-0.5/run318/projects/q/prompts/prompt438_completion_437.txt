  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons` is a different array than `unhandledRejections`, and the code that uses `unhandledRejections` is not expecting to receive `unhandledReasons`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` is a different array than `unhandledRejections`, and the code that uses `unhandledRejections` is not expecting to receive `reportedUnhandledRejections`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejection` is a different object than `unhandledRejections`, and the code that uses `unhandledRejections` is not expecting to receive a rejection object.

DONE.
