  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the value of `cb`, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator multiplies the value of `cb` by 2, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
