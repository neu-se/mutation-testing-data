  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the value returned by the Node function, while this code fragment resolves the promise with the value passed to the `deferred.resolve` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the promise with the error returned by the Node function, while this code fragment rejects the promise with the error passed to the `deferred.reject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment notifies the promise with the value returned by the Node function, while this code fragment notifies the promise with the value passed to the `deferred.notify` method.

DONE.
