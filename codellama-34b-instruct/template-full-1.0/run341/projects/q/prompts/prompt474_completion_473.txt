  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `untrackRejection` expects `at` to be non-negative and less than the length of the `unhandledRejections` array. If `at` is 0, the function will throw an error and break the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `untrackRejection` expects `at` to be non-negative and less than the length of the `unhandledRejections` array. If `at` is equal to the length of the array, the function will attempt to access an element that does not exist, which will cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `untrackRejection` expects `at` to be a number and will behave unexpectedly if it is null.

DONE.
