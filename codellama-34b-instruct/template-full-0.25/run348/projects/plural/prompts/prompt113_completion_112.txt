  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trouser
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "trouser" is not included in the list of words that are not pluralized, and therefore would be pluralized as "trousers" instead of being left unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pantie
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "pantie" is not included in the list of words that are not pluralized, and therefore would be pluralized as "panties" instead of being left unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothe
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "clothe" is not included in the list of words that are not pluralized, and therefore would be pluralized as "clothes" instead of being left unchanged.

DONE.
