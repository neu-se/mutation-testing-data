  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method without a starting index returns a substring from the current index to the end of the string, whereas the `substr` method with a starting index returns a substring from the starting index to the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method without a starting index returns a substring from the current index to the end of the string, whereas the `substring` method with a starting index returns a substring from the starting index to the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of substrings, whereas the indexing operator returns a specific element of the array.
