  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This change will cause the `sec` function to return the wrong value, as it will use the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This change will cause the `sec` function to return a value that is one unit larger than the correct value, which will result in an incorrect calculation of the complex arcus sinus.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This change will cause the `sec` function to return a value that is the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which will result in an incorrect calculation of the complex arcus sinus.

DONE.
