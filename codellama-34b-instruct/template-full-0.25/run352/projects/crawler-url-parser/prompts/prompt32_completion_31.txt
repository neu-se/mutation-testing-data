  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL starts with a protocol, while 'https://' would ensure that the URL starts with a secure protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + linkurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL starts with a protocol, while 'http://' + linkurl.host would ensure that the URL starts with a protocol and includes the hostname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + linkurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL starts with a protocol, while 'http://' + linkurl.hostname would ensure that the URL starts with a protocol and includes the hostname.

DONE.
