  DONE. Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with buggy code fragments that have different behavior than the original code:
```
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, while the original code only checks for value equality using the `==` operator. So if `stream` is a function, this code would produce a different result than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!stream || 'function' !== typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the expression, so if `stream` is not a function, this code would produce a different result than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.lengthesis > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of the `stream` array, while the original code checks if `stream
