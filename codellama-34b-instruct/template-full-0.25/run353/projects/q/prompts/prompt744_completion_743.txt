  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a different function than `onFulfilled`, and would be called when the promise is rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, and would be called when the promise is either fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("test"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, causing the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
