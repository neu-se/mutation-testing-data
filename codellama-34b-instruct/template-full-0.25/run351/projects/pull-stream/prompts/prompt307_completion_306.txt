  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` if `ended` is true, but this new code fragment calls `cb` regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `data` as an argument to `cb`, but this new code fragment passes `null` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `null` as the first argument to `cb`, but this new code fragment passes `true` instead.

DONE.
