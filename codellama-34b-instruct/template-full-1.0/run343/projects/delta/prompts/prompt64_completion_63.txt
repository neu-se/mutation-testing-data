  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object in non-strict mode, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `Delta` instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error, whereas the original code fragment calls the `push` method of the `Delta` instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops` refers to a different object than the original code fragment, which could cause unexpected consequences.

DONE.
