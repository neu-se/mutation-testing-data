  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks to see if the object is zero, while the modified code fragment always evaluates to false, resulting in a different outcome for the test case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks to see if the object is zero, while the modified code fragment always evaluates to true, resulting in a different outcome for the test case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (Math.random() < 0.5)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks to see if the object is zero, while the modified code fragment always evaluates to a random boolean value, resulting in a different outcome for the test case.

DONE.
