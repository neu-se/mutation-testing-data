  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.cos` to compute the cosine of an angle, but `Math.sqrt` would compute the square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.cos` to compute the cosine of an angle, but `Math.abs` would compute the absolute value of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.cos` to compute the cosine of an angle, but `Math.random` would generate a random number between 0 and 1.

DONE.
