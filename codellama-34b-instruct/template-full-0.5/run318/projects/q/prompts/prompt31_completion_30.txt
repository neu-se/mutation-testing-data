  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pop the first element from the `laterQueue` array, rather than the last element as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(laterQueue.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pop the last element from the `laterQueue` array, but it would also cause an error if the array is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pop the last element from the `laterQueue` array, but it would also cause an error if the array is empty.

DONE.
