 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.forEach.call(this.ops, predicate);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Array.prototype.forEach` instead of the `forEach` method of the `ops` array, potentially not having the same context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(predicate).forEach(predicate);
```
This would result in different behavior because it first filters the `ops` array and then applies the `predicate` to the filtered elements, which is not equivalent to the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...this.ops].forEach(predicate);
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `ops` array and applies the `predicate` to the copied elements, not affecting the original `ops` array.

DONE.
