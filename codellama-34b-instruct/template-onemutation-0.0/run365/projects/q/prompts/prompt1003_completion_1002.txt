  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, deferred.makeNodeResolver()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, and it is not clear what its purpose is. It is possible that the function is defined elsewhere in the codebase, but without more context, it is not possible to determine the exact behavior of the code with this change.

DONE.
