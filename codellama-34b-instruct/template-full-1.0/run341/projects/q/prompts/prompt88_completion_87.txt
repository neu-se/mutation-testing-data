  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fragment.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` mutates the original array, unlike `arguments`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fragment.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a new array, unlike `arguments`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fragment.unshift(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` alters the original array, unlike `arguments`.

DONE.
