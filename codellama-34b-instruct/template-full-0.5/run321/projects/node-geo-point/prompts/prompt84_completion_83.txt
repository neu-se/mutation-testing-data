  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the `sinφ2` calculation would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is a trigonometric function, and the `sinφ2` calculation would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cot
```
This would result in different behavior because `cot` is a trigonometric function, and the `sinφ2` calculation would be incorrect.

DONE.
