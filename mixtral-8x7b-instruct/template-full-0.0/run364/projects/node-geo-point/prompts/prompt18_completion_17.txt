 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof object !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't check for null values, unlike the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(object) !== '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the object's internal [[Class]] property, which is not the same as checking the type of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!Array.isArray(object) && object !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object is not an array and not null, which is different from checking if the object is not an object or null.

DONE.
