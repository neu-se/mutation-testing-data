  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an Error object, while the replacement code fragment is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an Error object, while the replacement code fragment is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an Error object, while the replacement code fragment is a new Error object.

DONE.
