 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => drain
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a function that returns `drain`, instead of invoking `drain` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the `drain` function, instead of invoking `drain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `drain` function to a string, instead of invoking `drain`.

DONE.
