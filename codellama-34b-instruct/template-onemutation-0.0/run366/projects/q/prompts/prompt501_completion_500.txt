  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value. In the context of the code, `void 0` is used to indicate that the `this` value should be undefined, whereas `null` would be a valid value for `this`.

DONE.
