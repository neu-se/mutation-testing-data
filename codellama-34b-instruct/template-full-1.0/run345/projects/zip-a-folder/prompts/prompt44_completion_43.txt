  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory('../', false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to add files from the parent directory to the archive, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add all files from the `src` directory to the archive, not just the ones specified by the glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob('../' + src + '/*');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add all files from the parent directory and its subdirectories to the archive, not just the ones specified by the glob.

DONE.
