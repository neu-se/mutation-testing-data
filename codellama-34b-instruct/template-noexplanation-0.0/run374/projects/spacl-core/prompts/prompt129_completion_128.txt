  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This change will cause the loop to decrement the index instead of incrementing it, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely or skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This change will cause the loop to increment the index by 2 instead of 1, which may cause the loop to skip over certain elements in the array or terminate prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 0
```
This change will cause the loop to reset the index to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, which may cause the loop to run indefinitely or terminate prematurely.

DONE.
