 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the keys of `a` instead of `b`, potentially causing unexpected overwrites or missing updates in the resulting `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it treats `a` as `any`, bypassing type checking and potentially causing runtime errors or unexpected behavior in the rest of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(a as unknown)
```
This would result in different behavior because it also bypasses type checking, potentially causing runtime errors or unexpected behavior in the rest of the function, similar to Option 2.

DONE.
