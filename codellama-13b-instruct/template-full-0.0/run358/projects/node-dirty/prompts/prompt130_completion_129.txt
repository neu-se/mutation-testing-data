  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val, cbs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` variable is now included in the destructuring assignment, which would cause the `key` and `val` properties to be set on the `row` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs, val]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` variable is now included in the destructuring assignment, which would cause the `key` and `val` properties to be set on the `row` object.
