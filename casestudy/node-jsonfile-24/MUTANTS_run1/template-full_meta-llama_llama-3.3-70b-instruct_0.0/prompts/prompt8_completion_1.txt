Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.toString(), options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `data` variable, which could potentially alter its value if it's not already a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data, options ? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is used instead of `null` as the default value for the reviver function, which could lead to different parsing behavior in certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slice(1), options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method is called on the `data` variable, which would remove the first character from the string, potentially causing the JSON parsing to fail or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
