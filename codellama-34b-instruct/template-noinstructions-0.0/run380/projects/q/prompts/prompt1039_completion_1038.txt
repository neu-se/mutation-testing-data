  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `closed.reject(error)`, which would reject the promise with the given error, whereas the new code fragment would resolve the promise with the error, which could cause the test suite to pass even if the code is not functioning correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(new Error("Different error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `closed.reject(error)`, which would reject the promise with the given error, whereas the new code fragment would resolve the promise with a different error, which could cause the test suite to pass even if the code is not functioning correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `closed.reject(error)`, which would reject the promise with the given error, whereas the new code fragment would
