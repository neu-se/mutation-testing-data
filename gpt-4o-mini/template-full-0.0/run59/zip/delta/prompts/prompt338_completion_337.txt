Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the next base operation, potentially causing incorrect handling of the operations that follow, leading to an incomplete or incorrect inversion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access a previous index that may not exist, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect data being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it moves the index forward by the length of the current operation, which could cause the inversion logic to skip over necessary operations, resulting in an incorrect inverted Delta.

DONE.
