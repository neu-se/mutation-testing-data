Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the filename instead of the line number, which would lead to incorrect parsing of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the line number, which would misrepresent the actual line number in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access an index that does not exist in the `attempt2` array, leading to an `undefined` value instead of the expected line number.

DONE.
