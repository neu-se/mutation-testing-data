  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, errback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has changed, which could cause the function to fail if it relies on a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback, errback, result
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument has been added, which could cause the function to fail if it doesn't expect it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback, errback + result
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` argument has been modified, which could cause the function to fail if it relies on a specific value.

DONE.
