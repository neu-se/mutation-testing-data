  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spawn(makeGenerator)(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with `null` as an argument, which may cause it to throw an error or return a promise that is rejected, rather than returning a promise that is fulfilled with a generator object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spawn(makeGenerator)(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with `undefined` as an argument, which may cause it to throw an error or return a promise that is rejected, rather than returning a promise that is fulfilled with a generator object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spawn(makeGenerator)(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with `42` as an argument, which may cause it to throw an error or return a promise that is rejected, rather than
