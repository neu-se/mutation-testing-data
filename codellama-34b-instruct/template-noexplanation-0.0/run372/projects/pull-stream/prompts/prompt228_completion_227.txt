  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This change will cause the `filterNot` function to always return `true`, regardless of the input data. This is a buggy behavior, and it will cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the `filterNot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(1)
```
This change will cause the `filterNot` function to always return `false`, regardless of the input data. This is a buggy behavior, and it will cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the `filterNot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(0, 1)
```
This change will cause the `filterNot` function to always return `true`, regardless of the input data. This is a buggy behavior, and it will cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the `filterNot` function.
