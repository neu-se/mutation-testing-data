 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let i = -1; i < rules.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start with `-1` instead of `0`, causing the first rule to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length; i--;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start with the last index and decrement it, causing the loop to not execute at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i <= rules.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would check if `i` is less than or equal to `rules.length`, which would cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds` error when `i` is equal to `rules.length`.

DONE.
