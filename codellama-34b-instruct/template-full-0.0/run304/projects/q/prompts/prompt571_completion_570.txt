  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behaviors when it comes to the `this` context and the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will have its `this` context set to the first argument passed to `bind`, and the arguments passed to the new function will be passed to the original function after the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` sets the `this` context of the function to the first argument passed to it, and the arguments passed to the function will be passed to the original function as an array. By passing `null` as the first argument, the `this` context of the function will
