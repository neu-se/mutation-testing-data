  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null && typeof value === "object" && typeof value.then === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of a `then` method on the value, which is not a reliable indicator of whether it is a promise or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === "[object Promise]"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the string representation of the value, which is not a reliable indicator of whether it is a promise or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether the value is an instance of the `Promise` constructor, which is not a reliable indicator of whether it is a promise or not.

DONE.
