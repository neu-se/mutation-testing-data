  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1] > attempt3[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to enter the if block when the line number is greater than the column number, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1] === attempt3[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to enter the if block when the line number is equal to the column number, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1] !== attempt3[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to enter the if block when the line number is not equal to the column number, which is the opposite of the original condition.

DONE.
