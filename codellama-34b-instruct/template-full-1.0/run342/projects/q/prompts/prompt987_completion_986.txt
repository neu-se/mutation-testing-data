  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` argument is added to the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the function to fail if it does not expect or handle this extra argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` and `nodeArgs` arguments are swapped, which could cause the function to pass the wrong value to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[[name], nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` argument is wrapped in an extra array, which could cause the function to fail if it does not expect or handle this extra level of nesting.

DONE.
