  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and therefore the `isInfinite` method would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and therefore the `isFinite` method would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and therefore the `isNaN` method would not be called.

DONE.
