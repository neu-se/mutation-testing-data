  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `pendingCount` is equal to 0, but the mutated code checks if it's less than 0. This would cause the function to return a rejected promise if `pendingCount` is less than 0, even if all the promises have been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `pendingCount` is equal to 0, but the mutated code checks if it's equal to the length of the `promises` array. This would cause the function to return a resolved promise if `pendingCount` is equal to the length of the `promises` array, even if not all the promises have been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
