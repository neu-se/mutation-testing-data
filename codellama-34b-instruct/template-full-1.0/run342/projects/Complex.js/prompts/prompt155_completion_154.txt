  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isNaN']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `NaN` if both `this` and `z` are `NaN`, whereas the original code would return `NaN` if either `this` or `z` is `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isNaN']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']() && this['isEven'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `NaN` if `this` and `z` are both `NaN`, and `this` is even, whereas the original code would return `NaN` if either `this` or `z` is `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isNaN']() && z['isZero']
