  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is the callback for fulfilled promises, while `_rejected` is the callback for rejected promises. Using `_fulfilled` instead of `_rejected` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the exception, rather than being rejected with it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `exception` parameter, while this code uses a hardcoded string `"error"`. This would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `exception` parameter, while this code uses a new `Error` object with a hardcoded message. This would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason than the original code.
