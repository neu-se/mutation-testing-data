  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the `rowStr` is equal to 0, instead of checking if the string is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the trimmed string is equal to an empty string, instead of checking if the string is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.indexOf('key') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the string 'key' is not found in the `rowStr`, instead of checking if the string is falsy.

DONE.
