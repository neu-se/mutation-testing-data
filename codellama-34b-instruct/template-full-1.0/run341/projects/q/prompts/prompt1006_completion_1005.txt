  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a TypeError, as the `Q.dispatch` method expects the first argument to be an object, but it would receive the string "foo" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.dispatch` method to return a promise that is immediately rejected with the error `TypeError: Cannot read property 'post' of null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.dispatch` method to return a promise that is immediately rejected with the error `TypeError: Cannot read property 'post' of undefined`.

DONE.
