  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a function, so the `continuer` function would not be called in response to a rejection of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a function, so the `continuer` function would not be called in response to a rejection of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that would be called in response to a rejection of the promise, and it would result in a rejection of the resulting promise.

DONE.
