  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'load'` event with a size of 0, while the modified code emits an `'error'` event with a size of 0, which could cause the program to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
