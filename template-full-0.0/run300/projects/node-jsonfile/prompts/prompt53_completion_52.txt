  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `replacer` is a function that is called with the object and the key, but `replacer = null` would simply assign the value `null` to the variable `replacer`, without calling the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = function(key, value) { return value.toUpperCase(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `replacer` is a function that is called with the object and the key, but `replacer = function(key, value) { return value.toUpperCase(); }` would assign a new function to the variable `replacer` that would uppercase the value before returning it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = function(key, value) { return value.toLowerCase(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the
