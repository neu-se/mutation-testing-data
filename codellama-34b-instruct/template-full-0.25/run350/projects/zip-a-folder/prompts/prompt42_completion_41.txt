  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `file` is a different method than `glob`, and it would cause the code to archive individual files instead of matching files based on a pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory
```
This would result in different behavior because `directory` is a different method than `glob`, and it would cause the code to archive a directory instead of matching files based on a pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `finalize` is a different method than `glob`, and it would cause the code to finalize the archive instead of matching files based on a pattern.

DONE.
