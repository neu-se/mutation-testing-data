  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isNaN` checks if a value is a number, while `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== a` checks if a value is `NaN`, while `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number.

DONE.
