  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter would be incremented by 1, which could cause the function to return a different country than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the function to return a different country than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter would be divided by 2, which could cause the function to return a different country than expected.

DONE.
