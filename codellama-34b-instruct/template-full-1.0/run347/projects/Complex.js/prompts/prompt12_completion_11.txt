  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a positive value, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a value that is one greater than the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a value that is twice the input.

DONE.
