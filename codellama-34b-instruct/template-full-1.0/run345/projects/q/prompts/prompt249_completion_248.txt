  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string, while `length - 1` returns the length of the string minus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(0, 1)` returns the first character of the string, while `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.replace(/Error\n/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace()` returns the string with the first occurrence of the specified value replaced with the given replacement string, while `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string.

DONE.
