  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return the entire string instead of the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return the last two characters of the string instead of the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return the first character of the string instead of the last character.

DONE.
