  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `opLength` variable, which is the length of the current operation, to determine how many characters to delete. Replacing it with `0` would cause the code to delete zero characters, which would not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `opLength` variable, which is the length of the current operation, to determine how many characters to delete. Replacing it with `-1` would cause the code to delete one fewer character than the original code, which would not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `opLength` variable, which is the length of the current operation, to determine how many characters to delete. Replacing it
