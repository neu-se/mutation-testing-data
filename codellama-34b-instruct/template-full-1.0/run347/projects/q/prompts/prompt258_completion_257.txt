  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise instead of fulfilling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to the original promise, but not necessarily the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(Q.resolve(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to the original promise, but not necessarily the original value.

DONE.
