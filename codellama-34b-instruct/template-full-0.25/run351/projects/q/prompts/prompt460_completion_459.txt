  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at == -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, even if the `promise` is in the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called for all `promise`s in the `unhandledRejections` array, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called for all `promise`s in the `unhandledRejections` array, not just the first one.

DONE.
