  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that closes the write stream, whereas `destroy()` is a method that destroys the write stream. Closing the stream would prevent any further writes from being made, but destroying the stream would cause the stream to be closed and any pending writes to be discarded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` is a method that destroys the write stream, but in this case, it would also cause an error to be thrown with the message "Intentional error". This would cause the program to crash and any pending writes to be discarded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` is a method that writes data to the stream
