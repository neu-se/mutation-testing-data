  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getNumStr` function with the `min` argument, which is not the same as calling the function with the `offset` argument as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(offset % 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getNumStr` function with the result of `offset % 60`, which is not the same as calling the function with the `offset` argument as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getNumStr` function with the result of `offset / 60`, which is not the same as calling the function with the `offset` argument as in the original code.

DONE.
