  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the second element instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last element instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at a random element instead of the first.

DONE.
