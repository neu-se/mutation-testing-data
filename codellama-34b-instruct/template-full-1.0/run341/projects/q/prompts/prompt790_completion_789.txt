  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('intended bug');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the promise to be rejected with the given error message, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the promise to be fulfilled with the value `undefined`, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the promise to be fulfilled with the value `'hello'`, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
