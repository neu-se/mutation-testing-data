  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nfapply` and `nfcall` methods to always pass the same array of `[1, 2, 3]` as their first argument, rather than the array passed to the `nfapply` or `nfcall` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let arg = array_slice(arguments, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nfapply` and `nfcall` methods to always use the result of `array_slice(arguments, 1)` as their first argument, rather than the array passed to the `nfapply` or `nfcall` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nfapply` and `nfcall` methods to always pass `null` as their first
