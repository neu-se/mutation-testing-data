  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, value, index, self.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not defined for the `thisp` object, which would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, value, index, self.push
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is not defined for the `thisp` object, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, value, index, self.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method is not defined for the `thisp` object, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
