  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '').replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the matched substring with a forward slash, while the modified code fragment replaces it with an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the matched substring in the first occurrence, while the modified code fragment replaces all occurrences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '')
```
