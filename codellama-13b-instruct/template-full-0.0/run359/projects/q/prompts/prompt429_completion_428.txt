  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the state of the promise, while the new code fragment returns the state of the promise's inspect object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the new code fragment returns the value of the promise's inspect object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the reason of the promise, while the new code fragment returns the reason of the promise's inspect object.

DONE.
