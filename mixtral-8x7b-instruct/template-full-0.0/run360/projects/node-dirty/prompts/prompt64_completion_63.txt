 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.destroySync
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroySync` is not a valid method for the `WritableStream` class, and it would throw a `TypeError` when executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.unref
