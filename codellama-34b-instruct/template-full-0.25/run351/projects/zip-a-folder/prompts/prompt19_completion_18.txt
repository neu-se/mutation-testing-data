  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator (`&`) is used instead of the bitwise OR operator (`|`), which would result in a different set of permissions being checked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) is used instead of the bitwise OR operator (`|`), which would result in a different set of permissions being checked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK + fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator (`+`) is used instead of the bitwise OR operator (`|`), which would result in a different set of permissions being checked.
