  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude are swapped, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 180 * (coordinate.latitude + coordinate.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude are added together, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 180 * (coordinate.latitude - coordinate.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude are subtracted, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

DONE.
