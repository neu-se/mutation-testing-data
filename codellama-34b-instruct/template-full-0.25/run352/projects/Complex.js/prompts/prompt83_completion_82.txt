  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the sum of `plus` and `minus` was equal to 0, but this new code fragment checks if it is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus - minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the sum of `plus` and `minus` was equal to 0, but this new code fragment checks if the difference between `plus` and `minus` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the sum of `plus` and `minus` was equal to 0, but this new code fragment checks if the sum is equal to 1.

DONE.
