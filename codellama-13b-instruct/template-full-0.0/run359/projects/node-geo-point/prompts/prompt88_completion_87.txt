  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function returns the cosine of the input angle, while the `sin` function returns the sine of the input angle. The `cos` function is used in the original code to calculate the latitude and longitude of the destination point, while the `sin` function is used to calculate the latitude and longitude of the starting point. Replacing `cos` with `sin` would result in the destination point being calculated using the sine of the latitude and longitude, which would result in a different location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function returns the tangent of the input angle, while the `cos` function returns the cosine of the input angle. The `cos` function is used in the original code to calculate the latitude and longitude of the destination point, while the `tan` function is used to calculate the latitude and longitude of the starting point. Replacing `cos` with `tan` would result in
