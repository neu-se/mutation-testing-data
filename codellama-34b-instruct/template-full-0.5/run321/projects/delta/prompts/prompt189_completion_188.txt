  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the attributes are empty, while this new code checks if the attributes are equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the attributes are empty, while this new code checks if the attributes are null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the attributes are empty, while this new code checks if the attributes are an empty object.

DONE.
