Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for the `quantileSelect` function call from the left index `l` to the right index `r`, potentially affecting the sorting process and resulting quantile calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[m]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the middle index `m` instead of the left index `l`, which could alter the partial sorting and selection of quantiles, especially when dealing with multiple quantile requests.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it fixes the starting index for the `quantileSelect` function call to always be 0, regardless of the current segment being processed, which could lead to incorrect quantile calculations if the input array is not fully sorted.

DONE.
