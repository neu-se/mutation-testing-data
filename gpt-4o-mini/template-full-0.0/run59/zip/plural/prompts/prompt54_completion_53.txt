Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the entire word to uppercase instead of replacing the ending 'f' or 'fe' with 'ves', which would lead to incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.split('f').join('v')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all occurrences of 'f' with 'v' in the word, rather than specifically targeting the ending 'f' or 'fe', which could produce incorrect plural forms for words that contain 'f' elsewhere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character of the word and appends 'ves', which would incorrectly pluralize words that do not end in 'f' or 'fe', leading to incorrect results for many nouns.

DONE.
