 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Replaced code')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback function `cb` with an error or data, while the mutated code logs a message to the console and does not call the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback function `cb` with an error or data, while the mutated code terminates the process with a non-zero exit code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback function `cb` with an error or data, while the mutated code does not pass any arguments to the callback.

DONE.
