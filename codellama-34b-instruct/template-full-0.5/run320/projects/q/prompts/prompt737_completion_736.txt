  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `promises` array is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if the length is less than 0. This would cause the `all` function to return a rejected promise if the length of the `promises` array is greater than 0, even if all the promises are fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `promises` array is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if the length is equal to itself. This would cause the `all` function to return a rejected promise if the length of the `promises` array is greater than 0, even if all the promises are fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result
