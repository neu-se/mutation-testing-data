  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments. In this case, using `call` instead of `apply` would cause the `fulfilled` function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
