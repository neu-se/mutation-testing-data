  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `concat` returns a new array that contains the elements of the original array and the elements of the array passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` returns a new array that contains the elements of the original array, while `concat` returns a new array that contains the elements of the original array and the elements of the array passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array that contains only the elements of the original array that satisfy the provided predicate function, while `concat` returns a new array that contains the elements of the original array and the elements of the array passed
