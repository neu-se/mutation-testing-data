Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!clobber
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the logic of the `clobber` option, causing the function to throw an error when `clobber` is true and delete the file when `clobber` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
clobber === 'true'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type checking of the `clobber` option, requiring it to be a string with the value 'true' instead of a boolean true value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof clobber === 'boolean'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of the `clobber` option instead of its value, allowing non-boolean values to pass through and potentially causing unexpected behavior.

DONE.
