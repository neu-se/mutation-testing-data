Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options` is a number instead of a string, which would cause the code to not treat string options correctly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when reading files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options` is strictly `null`, which would bypass the intended check for string options and could lead to incorrect handling of the `options` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options` is an array instead of a string, which would prevent the code from correctly processing string-based encoding options, leading to potential errors when reading files.

DONE.
