  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` value would be added to the array, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `undefined` value would be added to the array, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, ""]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra empty string value would be added to the array, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the array.

DONE.
