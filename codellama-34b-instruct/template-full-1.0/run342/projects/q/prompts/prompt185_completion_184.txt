  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```const foo = attempt1[1] + attempt1[2];```
This would result in different behavior because it would concat the value of the first group (i.e. `at functionName (filename:lineNumber:)`) with the value of the second group (i.e. `columnNumber`), which would not make sense in the context of the regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```const foo = attempt1[1] - attempt1[2];```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the value of the second group (i.e. `columnNumber`) from the value of the first group (i.e. `lineNumber`), which would not make sense in the context of the regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```const foo = attempt1[1] + attempt1[3];```
This would result in different behavior because it would concat the value of the first group (i.e. `at functionName (filename:lineNumber
