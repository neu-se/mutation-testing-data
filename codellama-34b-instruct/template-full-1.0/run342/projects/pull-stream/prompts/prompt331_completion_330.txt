  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end) onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `once` function if `end` is true, but this code fragment would call the `onEnd` function regardless of whether `end` is true or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end === true) onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code tests whether `end` is true, but this code fragment tests whether `end` is equal to the string "true".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end === null) onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code tests whether `end` is true, but this code fragment tests whether `end` is equal to the null value.

DONE.
