  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add the lengths of the two iterators, resulting in a longer length than the original code, which could cause the `diff()` function to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract the length of the `otherIter` iterator from the length of the `thisIter` iterator, resulting in a negative length, which could cause the `diff()` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the lengths of the two iterators, resulting in a much larger length than the original code, which could cause the `diff()` function to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
