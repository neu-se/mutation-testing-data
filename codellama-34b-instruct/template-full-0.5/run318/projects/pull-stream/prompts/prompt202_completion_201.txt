  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `abort` variable is truthy, while replacing it with `null` would cause the condition to always evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `abort` variable is truthy, while replacing it with `true` would cause the condition to always evaluate to true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `abort` variable is truthy, while replacing it with `!abort` would cause the condition to check if the `abort` variable is falsy.

DONE.
