Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the character being used as a placeholder from the null character (0) to a character with a code of 1, which may lead to unexpected results in the diffing process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because using -1 as a character code is invalid and would result in an error, potentially causing the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(255)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the placeholder character to the maximum value for a single byte (255), which may not be handled correctly in the diffing logic, leading to incorrect diffs or data corruption.

DONE.
