  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit()` would be called twice in the `if` block, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.enter()` would be called twice in the `if` block, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit()` would be called twice in the `if` block, which would cause an error.

DONE.
