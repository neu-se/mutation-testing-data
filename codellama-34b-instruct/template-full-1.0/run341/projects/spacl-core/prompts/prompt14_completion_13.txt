  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\/.+/$) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a path that ends with a forward slash, while the original code fragment matches a path that starts with a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+?\./) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a path that ends with a dot character, while the original code fragment matches a path that starts with a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+?[^\/]/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a path that ends with a character that is not a forward slash, while the original code fragment matches a path that starts with a forward slash.

DONE.
