  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would throw an error when invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise immediately, causing the `all` function to return a rejected promise even if some of the promises in the array are resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log;
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is not a function that would affect the behavior of the `all` function.

DONE.
