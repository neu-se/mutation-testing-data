  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is called when an error occurs, while `deferred.resolve` is called when the promise is resolved. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `deferred.resolve`, the promise will be resolved instead of rejected, which could potentially cause unintended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Unknown error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is called with a new `Error` object, which could provide more information about the error that occurred. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `deferred.reject(new Error("Unknown error"))`, the promise will be rejected with a more specific error message, which could help developers debug the issue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because
