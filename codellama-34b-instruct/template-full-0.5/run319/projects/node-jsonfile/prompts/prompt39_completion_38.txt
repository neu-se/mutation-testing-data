  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that writes data to a file, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that writes data to a file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile.bind(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(fs)` is a bound function that writes data to a file, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an unbound function that writes data to a file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile.bind(fs, file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(fs, file, str, options)` is a bound function that writes data to a file, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an unbound function that writes data to a file.

DONE.
