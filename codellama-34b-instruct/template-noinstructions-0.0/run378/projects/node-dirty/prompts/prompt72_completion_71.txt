  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'load'` event with the number of keys in the database, but this modified code would emit the `'load'` event with the number `1`, which could cause the calling code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'load'` event with the number of keys in the database, but this modified code would emit the `'load'` event with the number `-1`, which could cause the calling code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'load'` event with the number of keys in the database, but this modified code would emit the `'load'` event with the value `null`, which could cause the calling code to behave differently.

DONE.
