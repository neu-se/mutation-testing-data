  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the object is a promise, while the new code fragment is checking if the object has a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the object is a promise, while the new code fragment is checking if the object has an `inspect` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the object is a promise, while the new code fragment is checking if the object has an `isPromise` method.

DONE.
