  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator, which would invert the result of the `Array.isArray` check. This could cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw a `TypeError` when it should not, or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of the `Array.isArray` check. This could cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw a `TypeError` when it should not, or vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the result of the `Array.isArray` check by 0. This could cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw a `
