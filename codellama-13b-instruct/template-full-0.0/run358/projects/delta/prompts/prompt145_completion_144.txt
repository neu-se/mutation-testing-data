  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the newOp to the ops array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the newOp to the beginning of the ops array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the newOp to the ops array at the specified index, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
