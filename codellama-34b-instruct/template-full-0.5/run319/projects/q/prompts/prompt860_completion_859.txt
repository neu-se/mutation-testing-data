  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, rather than the original error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, rather than the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, rather than the original error.

DONE.
