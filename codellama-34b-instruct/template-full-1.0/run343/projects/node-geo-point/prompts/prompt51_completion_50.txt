  Sure, I can provide three options for the PLACEHOLDER with different behavior.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude + point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive value, whereas the original code fragment could return both positive and negative values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude * point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the two values, whereas the original code fragment would return the difference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude / point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the ratio of the two values, whereas the original code fragment would return the difference.

DONE.
