 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when the complex number's real part is 0, whereas the original code would return Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] > 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false if the real part of the complex number is greater than 1000, whereas the original code would return Infinity when the complex number is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true if the real part of the complex number is explicitly set to Infinity, whereas the original code would return true for any complex number with a real part of Infinity or a complex number of 0.

DONE.
