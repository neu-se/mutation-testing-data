  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected immediately, instead of being fulfilled with an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would never be settled, and the `all` function would never return a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state === "fulfilled" && promise.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered fulfilled even if it has no value, and the `all` function would return an array of values that includes `undefined`.

DONE.
