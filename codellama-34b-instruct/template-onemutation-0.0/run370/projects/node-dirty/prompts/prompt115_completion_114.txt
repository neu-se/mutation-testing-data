  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` is a property of the `Map` object, while `length` is a property of the `Array` object. In this case, `this._data` is a `Map` object, so using `length` instead of `size` would cause the code to return the wrong value.

DONE.
