  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver);
```
This would result in different behavior because we removed the parentheses from `makeNodeResolver`, which would cause the function to never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because we replaced the `deferred.makeNodeResolver` function with a useless empty function, causing the `nodeArgs` array to be created with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because we replaced the `deferred.makeNodeResolver` function with a null value, causing the `nodeArgs` array to be created with a different value.

DONE.
