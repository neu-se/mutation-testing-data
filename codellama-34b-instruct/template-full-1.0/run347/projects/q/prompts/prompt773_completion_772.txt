  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any(promises).allSettled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `any(promises).allSettled()` would compute the intersection of all resolved and rejected promises, whereas the original code fragment computes the union of all resolved and rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.allResolved()` would compute the union of all resolved and rejected promises, whereas the original code fragment computes the intersection of all resolved and rejected promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any(promises).then(Q.resolve, Q.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because `any(promises).then(Q.resolve, Q.reject)` would compute the interpolation of all resolved and rejected promises, whereas the original code fragment computes the union of all resolved and rejected promises.

DONE.
