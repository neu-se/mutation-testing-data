  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removed the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would leave it in place.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, 'javascript:void(0)');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removed the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would replace it with a JavaScript expression that does nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, 'invalid');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removed the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would replace it with an invalid string.

DONE.
