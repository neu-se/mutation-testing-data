  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the constant `StopIteration` is defined, while this fragment checks if it is not defined. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where `StopIteration` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `StopIteration` is a constant, while this fragment checks if it is a function. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where `StopIteration` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `StopIteration` is a constant, while this fragment checks if it is an object. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where `StopIteration` is an object
