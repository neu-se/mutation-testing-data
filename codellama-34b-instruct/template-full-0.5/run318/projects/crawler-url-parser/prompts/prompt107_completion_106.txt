  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap.has()` method would always return `false`, as `null` is not a valid key for the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap.has()` method would always return `false`, as the key `"foo"` is not present in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap.has()` method would check for the presence of the `baseurl` property of the `currentUrl` object, which may not be the same as the `url` property.

DONE.
