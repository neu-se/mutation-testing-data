  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the compression level is uncompressed, while this new code fragment checks if it is not uncompressed. This would cause the code to take the other branch of the if statement, which is the branch for compressed files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the compression level is uncompressed, while this new code fragment checks if it is high. This would cause the code to take the other branch of the if statement, which is the branch for compressed files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the compression level is uncompressed
