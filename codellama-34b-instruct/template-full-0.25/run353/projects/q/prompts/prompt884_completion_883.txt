  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that invokes the function with the given arguments, while `fapply` is a method that invokes the function with the given arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfapply` is a method that invokes the function with the given arguments, while `fapply` is a method that invokes the function with the given arguments as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.nfcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfcall` is a method that invokes the function with the given arguments, while `fapply` is a method that invokes the function with the given arguments as an array.

DONE.
