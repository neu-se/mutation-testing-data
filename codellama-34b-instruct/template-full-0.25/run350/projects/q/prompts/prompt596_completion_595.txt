  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` would be bound to the first element of `args`, rather than the original `self` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0], args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0]` and `args[1]` would be bound to the first two elements of `args`, rather than the original `self` and `args` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0], self
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0]` would be bound to the first element of `args`, and `self` would be bound to the original `self` value.

DONE.
