 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inspected.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the state is either "pending" or "rejected", while this change would cause the `valueOf` method to return the promise itself when the state is "fulfilled", which might not be the desired behavior in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inspected.state === "fulfilled" || inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the state is either "pending" or "rejected", while this change would cause the `valueOf` method to return the promise itself only when the state is "fulfilled" or "rejected", which might not be the desired behavior in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inspected.state === "settled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the custom states
