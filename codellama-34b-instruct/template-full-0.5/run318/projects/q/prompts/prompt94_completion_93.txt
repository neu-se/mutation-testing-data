  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if the index is within the bounds of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if the index is outside the bounds of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if the index is outside the bounds of the array.

DONE.
