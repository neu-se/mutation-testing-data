  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` variable is now converted to uppercase, which may cause the test to fail if the original code was expecting a lowercase string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` variable is now converted to lowercase, which may cause the test to fail if the original code was expecting an uppercase string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` variable is now trimmed of whitespace, which may cause the test to fail if the original code was expecting a string with whitespace.

DONE.
