  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `postMessage` method takes a message object as its first argument. Using `1` as the argument would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` when an object is expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `postMessage` method takes a non-empty string as its second argument. Using `false` as the argument would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` when a string is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `postMessage` method takes a message object as its first argument. Using `undefined` as the argument would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` when an object is expected.

DONE.
