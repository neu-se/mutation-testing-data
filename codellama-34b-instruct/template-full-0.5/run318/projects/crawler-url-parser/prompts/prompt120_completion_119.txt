  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.url` and `baseUrl.url` are different strings, which would cause the `gettype` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol, baseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.protocol` and `baseUrl.protocol` are different strings, which would cause the `gettype` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host, baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.host` and `baseUrl.host` are different strings, which would cause the `gettype` function to return a different value.

DONE.
