  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be `undefined` instead of `Object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be `[Object object]` instead of `Object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Object()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be a new instance of `Object` instead of the original object.

DONE.
