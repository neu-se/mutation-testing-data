  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `reason`, and it would cause the `reject` method to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `reason`, and it would cause the `reject` method to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"error"` is a different value than `reason`, and it would cause the `reject` method to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
