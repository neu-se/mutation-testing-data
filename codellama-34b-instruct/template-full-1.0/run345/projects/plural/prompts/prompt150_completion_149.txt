  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `plural.bind(null)` creates a new function with the `plural` function as its target, but with the `this` value set to `null`. This means that the `plural` function will not be able to access the `rules` array, which is defined in the scope of the `plural` function, and the resulting function will not be able to correctly determine the plural form of the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural.bind({rules: rules})
```
This would result in different behavior because `plural.bind({rules: rules})` creates a new function with the `plural` function as its target, but with the `this` value set to an object that contains the `rules` array. This means that the resulting function will be able to access the `rules` array when determining the plural form of the input word.
