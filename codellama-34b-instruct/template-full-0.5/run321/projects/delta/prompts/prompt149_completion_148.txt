  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the difference between `firstOther.retain` and `firstLeft` is greater than 0, while this new code fragment checks if it is less than or equal to 0. This would cause the `otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft)` call to be skipped if the difference is 0 or negative, which could lead to different behavior in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the difference between `firstOther.retain` and `firstLeft` is greater than 0, while this new code fragment checks if it is equal to 0. This would cause the `otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft)` call to be skipped if the difference is 0, which could lead to different behavior in
