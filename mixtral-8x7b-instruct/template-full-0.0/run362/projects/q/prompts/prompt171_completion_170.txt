 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof isNodeFrame !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `isNodeFrame` instead of its value, potentially causing the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!isNodeFrame(globalThis)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `globalThis` is not a Node frame, which is not the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNodeFrame(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `null` is a Node frame, which is not the intended behavior in the original code.

DONE.
