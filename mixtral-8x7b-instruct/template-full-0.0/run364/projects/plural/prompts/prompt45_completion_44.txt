 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.push([/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `push` instead of `unshift`, adding the rule to the end of the `rules` array instead of the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.unshift(['[aeiouy]o$/i', function(w) { return w + 's' }])
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the regular expression in quotes, changing it from a regular expression object to a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.unshift([/[aeiouy]o$/i, 's' + function(w) { return w }])
