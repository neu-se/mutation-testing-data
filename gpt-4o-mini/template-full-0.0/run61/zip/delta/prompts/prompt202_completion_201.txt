Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.concat(rest).chop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument of the `chop` method from `<PLACEHOLDER>` to `1`, which may alter the resulting Delta by removing a different number of operations than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.concat(rest).chop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument of the `chop` method to `0`, which would effectively not remove any operations from the resulting Delta, potentially leading to unexpected results in the final output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.concat(rest).chop(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `-1` to the `chop` method may cause it to behave incorrectly, possibly leading to an error or unintended behavior, as negative values may not be handled properly in the context of chopping operations.

DONE.
