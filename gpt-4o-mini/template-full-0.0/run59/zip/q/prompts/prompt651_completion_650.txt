Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve a property instead of invoking a method, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors if the property does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to set a property instead of invoking a method, which could cause the program to behave incorrectly if the method is expected to return a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete a property instead of invoking a method, which could lead to unintended side effects if the property is critical to the object's functionality.

DONE.
