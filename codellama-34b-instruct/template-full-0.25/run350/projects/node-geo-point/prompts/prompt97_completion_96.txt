  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is a different variable than `y`, and the calculation of `λ2` would be affected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosθ` is a different value than `y`, and the calculation of `λ2` would be affected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinφ1` is a different value than `y`, and the calculation of `λ2` would be affected.

DONE.
