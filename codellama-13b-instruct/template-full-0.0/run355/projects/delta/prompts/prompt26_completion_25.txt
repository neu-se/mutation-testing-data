  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the number of keys in the `a` object, while this code fragment returns the number of keys in the `a` object that are also present in the `b` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the number of keys in the `a` object, while this code fragment returns the number of keys in the `b` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).length + Object.keys(b).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the number of keys in the `a` object, while this code fragment returns the sum of the number of keys in the `a` and `b` objects.

DONE.
