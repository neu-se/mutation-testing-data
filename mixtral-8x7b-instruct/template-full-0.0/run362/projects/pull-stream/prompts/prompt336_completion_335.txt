 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[data, end]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of arguments passed to the callback function is changed, which might cause issues if the tests or the code using this module rely on the specific order of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data, null
