  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "uplevel" for any link that is not on the same level as the page, regardless of whether it is a sublevel or uplevel link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "internal" for any link that is not on a different domain, regardless of whether it is an internal or external link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "sublevel" for any link that is not on the same level as the page, regardless of whether it is a sublevel or uplevel link.

DONE.
