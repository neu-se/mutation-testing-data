  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` is a promise, and `when` expects a value, not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback` is a function, and `when` expects a value, not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback` is a function, and `when` expects a value, not a function.

DONE.
