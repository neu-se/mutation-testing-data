 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would always include the file string, even if the 'throws' option is not set to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would only include the file string if the 'throws' option is explicitly set to true. If 'throws' is not provided or set to false, the error message would not include the file string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable name would not match the intended behavior. The 'shouldThrow' variable is used in the synchronous version of the function, but the 'throws' option is used in the asynchronous version. By changing the variable name, the test suite would not catch the error in the asynchronous version.

DONE.
