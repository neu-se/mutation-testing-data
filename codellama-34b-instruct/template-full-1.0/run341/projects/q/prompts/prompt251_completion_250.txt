  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because if `Q.longStackSupport` is `false`, the `promise.stack` property would no longer be defined, even if `hasStacks` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because if `Q.longStackSupport` is `true` and `hasStacks` is also `true`, the `promise.stack` property would be redefined, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks` are both `true`, the `promise.stack` property would not be defined, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
