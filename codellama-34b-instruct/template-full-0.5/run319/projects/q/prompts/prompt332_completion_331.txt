  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, while `resolve` would resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise, while `resolve` would resolve it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reject(exception))
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise, while `reject` would reject it.

DONE.
