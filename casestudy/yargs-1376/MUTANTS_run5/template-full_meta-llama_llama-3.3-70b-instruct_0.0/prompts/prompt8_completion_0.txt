Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.hasOwnProperty('extends')
```
This would result in different behavior because it does not use `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()` to check for the 'extends' property, which can lead to incorrect results if `config` has overridden the `hasOwnProperty` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'extends' in config
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of the 'extends' property in the prototype chain of `config`, whereas the original code only checks for the property directly on the `config` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.extends!== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'extends' property is not undefined, which is not the same as checking if the property exists on the object, as the original code does.

DONE.
