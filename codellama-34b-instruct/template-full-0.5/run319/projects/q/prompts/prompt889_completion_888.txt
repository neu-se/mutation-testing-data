  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that takes an array and a starting index as arguments, and returns a new array containing the elements from the starting index to the end of the array. In the original code, `array_slice` is called with `arguments` and `1` as arguments, which returns a new array containing all the elements from the second argument onwards. However, if we replace `1` with `2`, the new array will contain all the elements from the third argument onwards, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
