  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reverse(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reverse` reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas the original code fragment leaves the order of the elements unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args + [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra argument in the new code fragment will be passed to the `promiseDispatch` function, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the original code fragment is a function that takes a single argument, whereas the new code fragment modifies the first argument to be a value that is one more than the original value.

DONE.
