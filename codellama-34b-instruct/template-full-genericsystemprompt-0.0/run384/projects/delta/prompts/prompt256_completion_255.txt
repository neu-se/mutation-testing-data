  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) && thisOp.attributes === otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also compare the attributes of the two operations, which may not be equal even if the inserts are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) || thisOp.attributes === otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only compare the attributes of the two operations if the inserts are not equal, which may not be the desired behavior.
