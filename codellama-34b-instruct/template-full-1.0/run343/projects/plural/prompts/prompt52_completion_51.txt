  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern has been changed to match words that end with a vowel instead of a consonant. Therefore, the replacement function would return 's' instead of 'es' for words like "woman".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern has been modified to include the word "quy" at the end, and the replacement function has been changed to remove the last two characters instead of one, resulting in "quies" instead of "es".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$|quy$/i
