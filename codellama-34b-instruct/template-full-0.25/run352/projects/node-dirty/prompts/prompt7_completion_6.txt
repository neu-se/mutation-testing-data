  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, which could cause the code to access a different key in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be decremented by 1, which could cause the code to access a different key in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be concatenated with the string 'a', which could cause the code to access a different key in the map.

DONE.
