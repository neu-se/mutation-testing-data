  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` is a function that returns the directory name of a file path, while `undefined` is a value that doesn't have a directory name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` is a function that returns the directory name of a file path, while `null` is a value that doesn't have a directory name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'my-custom-dirname'
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` is a function that returns the directory name of a file path, while `'my-custom-dirname'` is a string that always returns the same directory name regardless of the file path.

DONE.
