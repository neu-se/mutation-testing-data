  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 ** zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of 2, while the new code fragment uses the `**` operator, which has a different precedence and may produce different results in some cases.

DONE.
