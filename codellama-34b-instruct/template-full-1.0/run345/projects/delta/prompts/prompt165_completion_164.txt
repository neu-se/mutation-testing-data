  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is an `OpIterator` for the `other` `Delta`, while `thisIter` is an `OpIterator` for the `this` `Delta`, and the `peekType` method returns the type of the current operation, which may be different between the two `Delta`s.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `$otherIter` is a jQuery object for the `other` `Delta`, and `peekType` is a jQuery method that returns the type of the current operation, which may be different between the two `Delta`s.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$otherIter.prev().peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `$otherIter.prev()` returns the previous element in the `other` `Delta`, and `peekType` is a jQuery
