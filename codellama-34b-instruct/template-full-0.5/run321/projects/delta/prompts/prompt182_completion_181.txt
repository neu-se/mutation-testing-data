  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with an argument of 0, which would return the first element of the array without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with an argument of -1, which would return the last element of the array without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with an argument of `length - 1`, which would return the last element of the array without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
