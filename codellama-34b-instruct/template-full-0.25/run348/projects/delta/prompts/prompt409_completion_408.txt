  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of `baseIndex + length`, which is the sum of the base index and the length of the slice, while this replacement returns the result of `index + 1`, which is the sum of the index and 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex - length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of `baseIndex + length`, which is the sum of the base index and the length of the slice, while this replacement returns the result of `baseIndex - length`, which is the difference between the base index and the length of the slice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of `baseIndex + length`, which is the sum of the base index and the length of the slice, while this replacement returns
