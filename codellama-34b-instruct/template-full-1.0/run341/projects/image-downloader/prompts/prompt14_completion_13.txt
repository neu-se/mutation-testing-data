  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `basename.toLowerCase()` returns a lowercase version of the `basename`, whereas `basename` itself returns the original basename. This could cause issues if the filename is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(pathname).substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename(pathname).substring(1)` returns the basename of the path without the first character, whereas `basename` itself returns the original basename. This could cause issues if the first character of the basename is important.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(pathname).split(path.sep).pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname(pathname).split(path.sep).pop()` returns the last element of the path array created by splitting the pathname by
