  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` and `y` are different variables, and the `join` method would return a rejection instead of a fulfillment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `y + 1` is not the same value as `y`, and the `join` method would return a rejection instead of a fulfillment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(y)` is a promise that is already fulfilled with the value of `y`, and the `join` method would return a fulfillment instead of a rejection.

DONE.
