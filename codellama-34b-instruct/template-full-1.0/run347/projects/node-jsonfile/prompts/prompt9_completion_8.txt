  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<>
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object would be passed to `stripBom`, which would not have the same behavior as passing a non-empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the `data` object, which would not have the same behavior as passing `data` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'x'` string would be concatenated to the `data` object, which would not have the same behavior as passing `data` directly.

DONE.
