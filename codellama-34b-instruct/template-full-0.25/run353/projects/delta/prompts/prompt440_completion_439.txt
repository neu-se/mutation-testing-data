  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while this replacement checks if it is not a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.insert` is not a string, for example if it is a number or an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while this replacement checks if it is a number. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.insert` is a number, for example if it is a string or an object.
