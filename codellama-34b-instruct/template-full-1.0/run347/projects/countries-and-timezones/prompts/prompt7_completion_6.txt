  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's property values, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the object's property name/value pairs, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.hasOwnProperty` checks if the object has a property with the specified name, while `Object.keys` simply returns the names of all the object's properties.

DONE.
