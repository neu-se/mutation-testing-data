  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This change will cause the `onAbort` function to be called immediately, rather than being passed as an argument to `abortCb`. This could potentially cause the `abortCb` function to be called with an incorrect argument, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(null)
```
This change will cause the `onAbort` function to be called with a `null` argument, which may not be what the developer intended. This could potentially cause the `abortCb` function to be called with an incorrect argument, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(undefined)
```
This change will cause the `onAbort` function to be called with an `undefined` argument, which may not be what the developer intended. This could potentially cause the `abortCb` function to be called with an incorrect argument, leading to unexpected behavior.
