  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of two or more numbers, while `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.min` returns the smallest of two or more numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, while `Math.min` returns the smallest of two or more numbers.

DONE.
