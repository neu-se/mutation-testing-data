  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method of the `Array.prototype` and `call` is a method of the `Function.prototype`. Using `array_slice.call(arguments, 1)` would result in a different value being returned, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method of the `Array.prototype` and it returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array. Using `arguments.slice(1)` would result in a different value being returned, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is a method of the `Array.prototype` and `call
