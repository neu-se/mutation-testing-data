 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would now receive a `false` value instead of `true`, potentially causing the code that handles the callback's result to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would now receive a `null` value instead of `true`, potentially causing the code that handles the callback's result to throw a `TypeError` if it expects a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would now receive the `abort` function as its argument, potentially causing the code that handles the callback's result to behave differently.

DONE.
