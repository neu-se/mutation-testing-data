 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now return `undefined` when `b` is `null`, whereas the original code returns `undefined` only when `b` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof b !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now return `undefined` when `b` is `undefined`, whereas the original code returns `undefined` only when `b` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b === undefined || typeof b !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now return `undefined` when `b` is either `undefined` or not an object, whereas the original code returns `undefined` only when `b` is not an object.

DONE.
