 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (value) {
    Q.nextTick(function () {
        nodeback(value);
    });
}, function (error) {
    Q.nextTick(function () {
        nodeback(null, error); // change to this
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value is being passed as the first argument in case of an error, which is not the standard Node.js-style callback behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (value) {
    Q.nextTick(function () {
        nodeback(value, value); // change to this
    });
}, function (error) {
    Q.nextTick(function () {
        nodeback(error);
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the same value is being passed as both the first and second argument in case of a successful resolution, which is not the standard Node.js-style callback
