  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let verb
```
This would result in different behavior because `verb` is now a local variable, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `verb` parameter of the `deny` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs` is now a constant, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `verbs` property of the `Rule` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'GET'
```
This would result in different behavior because `verb` is now a constant with the value `'GET'`, whereas the original code fragment refers to the `verb` parameter of the `deny` method, which can have any value.

DONE.
