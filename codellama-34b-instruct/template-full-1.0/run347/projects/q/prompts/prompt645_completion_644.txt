  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.post` method is used to post a message to a value in a future turn, and using `null` as the value would cause the method to error out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.post` method is used to post a message to a value in a future turn, and using `void 0` as the value would cause the method to error out.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.post` method is used to post a message to a value in a future turn, and using `false` as the value would cause the method to error out.

DONE.
