  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, updater(this.get(key)), cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called twice, which could cause unexpected side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, updater(this.get(key)), cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called with the wrong argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, updater(this.get(key)), cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called with the wrong context.

DONE.
