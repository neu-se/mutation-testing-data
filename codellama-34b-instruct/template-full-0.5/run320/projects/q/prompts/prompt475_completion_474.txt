  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, rather than the last one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the third element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, rather than the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, reportedUnhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, rather than the first one.

DONE.
