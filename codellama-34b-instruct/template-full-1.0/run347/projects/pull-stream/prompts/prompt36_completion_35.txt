  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the third element of the `ref` array, instead of the second element as in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the length of the `ref` array, instead of an element of the array as in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foobar"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string literal to the `pull` function, instead of an element of the `ref` array as in the original code fragment.

DONE.
