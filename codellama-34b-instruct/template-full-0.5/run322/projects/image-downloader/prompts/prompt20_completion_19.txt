  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute, while `!path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is not absolute. This change would cause the code to reject absolute paths, while the original code fragment accepted them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isRelative` checks if the path is relative, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute. This change would cause the code to reject relative paths, while the original code fragment accepted them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname(options.dest)` checks the extension of the file, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute. This change would cause the code to reject files with certain extensions,
