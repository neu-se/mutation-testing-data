 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof tokens[i + 1] === 'string' && (tokens[i + 1].toLowerCase() === 'i' || tokens[i + 1].toLowerCase() === 'j')
```
This would result in different behavior because it is case-insensitive, accepting both 'i' and 'j' for the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
tokens[i + 1].trim().toLowerCase() === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because it accepts the imaginary part even if it's preceded by any number of whitespace characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['i', 'j'].includes(tokens[i + 1].toLowerCase())
