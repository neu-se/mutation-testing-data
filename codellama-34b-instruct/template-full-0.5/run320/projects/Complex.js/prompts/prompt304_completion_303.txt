  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` as the argument for `Math.sin()`, while the replaced code fragment uses `2 * a`. This would cause the resulting complex number to be different, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` as the argument for `Math.sin()`, while the replaced code fragment uses `a + 1`. This would cause the resulting complex number to be different, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` as the argument for `Math.sin()`, while the replaced code fragment uses `a - 1`. This would cause the resulting complex number to be different, leading to different behavior.

DONE.
