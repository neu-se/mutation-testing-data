 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'The options.dest is missing'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would not be consistent with the original message, which might cause some test cases to miss catching the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new TypeError('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because a different error type is thrown, which might not be caught by tests expecting a specific error type (Error).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { throw new Error('The options.dest is required'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a function is thrown instead of a string, which might not be caught by tests expecting a string error message.

DONE.
