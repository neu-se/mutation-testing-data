  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object' && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object or null, while the new code checks if `a` is not an object and not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object' && a !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object or null, while the new code checks if `a` is not an object and not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object' && a !== typeof b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object or null, while the new code checks if `a` is not an object and not equal to the type of `b`.

DONE.
