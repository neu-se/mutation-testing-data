  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument would cause the `parse` method to not parse the query string, which could lead to incorrect results if the URL contains query parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument would cause the `parse` method to not parse the fragment, which could lead to incorrect results if the URL contains a fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` argument would cause the `parse` method to parse the query string and fragment, which could lead to incorrect results if the URL contains query parameters or a fragment that is not properly formatted.

DONE.
