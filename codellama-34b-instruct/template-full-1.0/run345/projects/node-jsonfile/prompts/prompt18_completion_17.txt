  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` is a different function than `fs.readFileSync`, and it returns a promise instead of the file contents directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the `options` object and reads the file synchronously, which could lead to blocking and performance issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createReadStream(file)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a readable stream instead of the file contents directly, and it requires additional code to read and parse the stream.

DONE.
