Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.toString(), options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `data` variable, which could potentially return a different value than the original `data` if it's an object or an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.reviver` property is not checked, and the entire `options` object is passed as the reviver function to `JSON.parse()`, which could cause an error if `options` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slice(1), options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method is called on the `data` variable, which would return a subset of the original data starting from the second character, potentially causing the JSON parsing to fail or return incorrect results.

DONE.
