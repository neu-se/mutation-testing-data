  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function is used to create a new object that inherits from `Promise.prototype`, but replacing it with `null` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method of the `null` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
