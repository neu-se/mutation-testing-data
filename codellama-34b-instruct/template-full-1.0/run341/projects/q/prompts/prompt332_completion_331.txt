  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer resolve the promise, but instead reject it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would resolve the promise with the value "foo" instead of the original value returned by `_fulfilled(value)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would resolve the promise with no value instead of the original value returned by `_fulfilled(value)`.

DONE.
