  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.countries.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of countries in the data.countries array, rather than the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.countries[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first country in the data.countries array, rather than the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.countries.filter(country => country.name === 'United States')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of countries with the name "United States", rather than the entire array of countries.

DONE.
