  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the lowercase version of `word`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the uppercase version of `word`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the substring of `word` starting from the second character.

DONE.
