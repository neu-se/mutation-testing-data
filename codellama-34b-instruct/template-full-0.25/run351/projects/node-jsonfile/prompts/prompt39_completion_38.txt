  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `fs.writeFile`, and it would cause the function to block until the file is written, rather than returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile.bind(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(fs)` is a bound version of `fs.writeFile`, and it would cause the function to be called with the `fs` object as the `this` context, rather than the default `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(null)` is a bound version of `fs.writeFile`, and it would cause the function to be called with `null` as the `this` context, rather than the default `this
