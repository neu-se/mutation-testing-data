Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key in obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of the key in the object's prototype chain, not just its own properties, potentially including inherited properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj.hasOwnProperty(key) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it only includes properties that are not the object's own, effectively excluding the object's own properties and only considering inherited ones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof obj[key] !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property exists and is not undefined, rather than checking if the object has its own property, potentially including properties with a value of undefined.

DONE.
