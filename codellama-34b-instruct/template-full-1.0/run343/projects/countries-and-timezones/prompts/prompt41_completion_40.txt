  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({ ...prev }, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object instead of modifying the existing one, which could cause issues with the code that uses the returned object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev.push(getCountry(id, options))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new country object onto the end of the existing array, instead of creating a new object that inherits from the existing one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev.concat(getCountry(id, options))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the new country object onto the end of the existing array, instead of creating a new object that inherits from the existing one.

DONE.
