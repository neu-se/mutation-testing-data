  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt2` is a different regex pattern that may match a different part of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3` is a different regex pattern that may match a different part of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1 + attempt2
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines the `attempt1` and `attempt2` regex patterns, which may match different parts of the stack trace.

DONE.
