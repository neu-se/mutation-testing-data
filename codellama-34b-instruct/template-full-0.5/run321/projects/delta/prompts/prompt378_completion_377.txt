  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, and `===` checks for strict equality. In this case, the original code was checking for the type of the next operation to be 'insert', and if it was, it would skip over it. If we replace the PLACEHOLDER with `otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'`, the code would check if the next operation is of type 'insert', and if it is, it would skip over it. However, if the next operation is not of type 'insert', the code would not skip over it, and it would potentially produce different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` checks for strict inequality. In this case, the original code was checking if the next operation is not of type 'insert', and if it is not,
