  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the second point instead of the first point, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a constant value (π) instead of the actual latitude, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitudes of both points instead of using just one, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
