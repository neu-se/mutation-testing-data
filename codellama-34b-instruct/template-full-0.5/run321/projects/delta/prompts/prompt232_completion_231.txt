  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.length` returns the total length of the iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next element in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra character to the length of the next element in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract an extra character from the length of the next element in the iterator.

DONE.
