  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is mathematically equivalent to `a * a + b * b`, but the replaced code fragment is mathematically equivalent to `a * b + a * b`, which is not the same as `a * a + b * b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is mathematically equivalent to `a * a + b * b`, but the replaced code fragment is mathematically equivalent to `a * a - b * b`, which is not the same as `a * a + b * b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is mathematically equivalent to `a * a + b * b`, but the replaced code fragment is mathematically equivalent to `a * b - b * a
