Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_progressed` function to always return `undefined`, effectively ignoring any progress notifications that should have been processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the progress value by incrementing it, which could lead to incorrect handling of progress notifications, especially if the value is not numeric.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Progress error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately throw an error whenever a progress notification is received, causing the promise to reject instead of propagating the progress value as intended.

DONE.
