  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to be called, which would return `true` if the stack line contains a reference to the Node.js module or the `node.js` file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to be called, which would return `true` if the stack line contains a reference to the `q.js` file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame() || isInternalFrame()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to be called, which would return `true` if the stack line contains a reference to the Node.js module or the `node.js` file, or the `isInternalFrame` function to be called, which would return `true` if the stack line contains a
