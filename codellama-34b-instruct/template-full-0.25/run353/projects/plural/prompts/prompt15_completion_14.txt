  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `w.length - 1` code fragment is used to determine the length of the word, and `w.length - 2` would result in a different length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `w.length - 1` code fragment is used to determine the length of the word, and `w.length + 1` would result in a different length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `w.length - 1` code fragment is used to determine the length of the word, and `w.length * 2` would result in a different length.

DONE.
