  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to finish immediately, without considering the rest of the operations in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to consider the previous operation instead of the current one, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to consider two operations at once, which may not be valid for the current operation or may lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
