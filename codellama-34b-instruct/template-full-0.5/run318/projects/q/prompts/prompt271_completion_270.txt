  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the `notify` method to be called if the `resolvedPromise` variable is equal to `true`. In the original code, the `notify` method can be called regardless of the value of `resolvedPromise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `notify` method to be called if the `resolvedPromise` variable is not equal to `false`. In the original code, the `notify` method can be called regardless of the value of `resolvedPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `notify` method to be called if the `resolvedPromise` variable is not equal to `undefined`. In the original code, the `notify` method can be called regardless
