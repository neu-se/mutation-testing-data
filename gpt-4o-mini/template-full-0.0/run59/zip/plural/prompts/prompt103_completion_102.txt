Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:cat|dog|fish)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches a different set of animals that are not uncountable, thus incorrectly allowing pluralization for these words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|sheep)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it redundantly includes "sheep" twice, which does not change the matching but could lead to confusion in the rule's intent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|goose)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds "goose" to the list, which is also an uncountable noun, but it is not part of the original set, potentially leading to incorrect pluralization behavior.

DONE.
