  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not defined in the code snippet, so this change would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function is not defined in the code snippet, so this change would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject(new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.reject` function is not defined in the code snippet, so this change would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

DONE.
