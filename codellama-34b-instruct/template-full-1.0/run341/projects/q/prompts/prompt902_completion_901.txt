  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.fail()` method would not be called on the promise returned by `this.fapply(nodeArgs)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function(){});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.fail()` method would not be called on the promise returned by `this.fapply(nodeArgs)` and the second argument to `.fail()` would be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `.fail()` would be different, and the promise returned by `this.fapply(nodeArgs)` would not be rejected by the `.reject()` method.

DONE.
