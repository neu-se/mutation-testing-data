  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This is the original code fragment, which is correct and should not be changed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, abort
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the order of the arguments reversed. This could potentially cause issues if the `abortCb` function is not designed to handle the arguments in this order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort, null
```
This code fragment adds an extra argument to the `abortCb` function, which could cause issues if the function is not designed to handle this extra argument.

DONE.
