 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'href' in $(this) ? $(this).attr('href') : ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'href' attribute exists in the element before trying to access it, avoiding potential TypeError when 'href' attribute is not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).attr('data-link') || $(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it first checks if the 'data-link' attribute exists and uses it if available, otherwise falling back to the 'href' attribute. This could potentially include additional links that were not considered before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the actual value of the 'href' attribute, including the leading 'http://' or 'https://' if present, whereas the original code might not include it.

DONE.
