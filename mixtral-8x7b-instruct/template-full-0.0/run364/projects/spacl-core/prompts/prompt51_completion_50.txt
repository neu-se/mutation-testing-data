 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the property name instead of the colon, changing the behavior of the regex generation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first two characters of the property name, skipping the colon, which would cause the regex generation to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire property name, including the colon, which would cause the regex generation to fail.

DONE.
