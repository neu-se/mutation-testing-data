 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / z['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the denominator is not just infinite, but specifically if dividing 1 by the imaginary part of z results in Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['im'] === 0 || z['im'] === Infinity
