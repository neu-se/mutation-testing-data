  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and calling `retain` instead of `delete` would cause the code to retain the deleted content instead of deleting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` and `delete` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and calling `push` instead of `delete` would cause the code to add the deleted content to the end of the delta instead of deleting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` and `delete` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and calling `concat` instead of `delete` would cause the code to concatenate the deleted content with the rest of the delta instead of deleting it.

DONE.
