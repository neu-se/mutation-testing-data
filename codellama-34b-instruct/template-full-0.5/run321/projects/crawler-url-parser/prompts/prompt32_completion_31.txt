  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment would always use the HTTPS protocol, whereas the original code fragment would use the HTTP protocol by default, but switch to HTTPS if the URL starts with "//".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment would always add the "www." subdomain to the URL, whereas the original code fragment would only add it if the URL doesn't already have a subdomain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://localhost'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment would always use the "localhost" hostname, whereas the original code fragment would use the hostname from the URL or the base URL.

DONE.
