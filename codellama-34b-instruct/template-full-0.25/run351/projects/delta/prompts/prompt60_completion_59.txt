  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'number' && arg === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the argument is a string and has a length of 0, while this new code checks if the argument is a number and has a value of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'object' && arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the argument is a string and has a length of 0, while this new code checks if the argument is an object and has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the argument is a string and has a length of 0, while this new code checks if the argument is a string and has a length of 1.

DONE.
