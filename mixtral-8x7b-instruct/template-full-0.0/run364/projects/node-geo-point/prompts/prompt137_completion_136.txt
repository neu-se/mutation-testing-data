 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
1 / this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a division by zero error if the `latitude` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.abs(this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a positive value for the latitude, which is not the case in the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the longitude value instead of adjusting the precision of the latitude and longitude.

DONE.
