  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first element of the array to the `fulfilled.apply()` method, instead of passing the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the elements of the array starting from the second element, instead of passing the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.concat(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the array twice to the `fulfilled.apply()` method, instead of passing the array once.

DONE.
