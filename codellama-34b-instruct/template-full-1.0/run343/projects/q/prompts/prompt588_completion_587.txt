  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in an error when the makeGenerator function is called, causing the promise to reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would cause makeGenerator to return an empty object, which is unlikely to have the expected properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would cause makeGenerator to return an empty array, which is unlikely to have the expected values.

DONE.
