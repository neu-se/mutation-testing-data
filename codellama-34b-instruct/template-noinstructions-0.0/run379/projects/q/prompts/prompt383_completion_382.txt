  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with `null` instead of the original value, which could cause the promise chain to resolve with an unexpected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with `undefined` instead of the original value, which could cause the promise chain to resolve with an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would throw an error instead of returning a value, which could cause the promise chain to reject with an unexpected error.

DONE.
