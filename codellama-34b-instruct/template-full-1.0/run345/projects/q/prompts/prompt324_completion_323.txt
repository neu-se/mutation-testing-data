  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
  throw new Error("intentional error");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with a new error, rather than returning the result of the `reject` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
  return Q.reject(error);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with a new error, rather than returning the result of the `reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
  return Q(error);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the `error` value, rather than returning the result of the `reject` function.

DONE.
