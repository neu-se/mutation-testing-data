 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof isNodeFrame !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `isNodeFrame` instead of its value, which could cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!isNodeFrame(globalThis)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `globalThis` is not a node frame, instead of checking the current stack line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `false`, causing the `isInternalFrame` function to exclude all stack lines.

DONE.
