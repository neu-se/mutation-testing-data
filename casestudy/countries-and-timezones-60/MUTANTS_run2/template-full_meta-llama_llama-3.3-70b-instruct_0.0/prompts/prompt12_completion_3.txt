Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the hours calculation would be based on twice the actual offset, leading to incorrect hour values in the resulting string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the hours calculation would be based on the absolute value of `utcOffset` (which is a variable from the outer scope), rather than the `offset` parameter passed to the `getOffsetStr` function, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset + 30
```
This would result in different behavior because the hours calculation would be based on the offset plus 30 minutes, rather than the actual offset, leading to incorrect hour and minute values in the resulting string.

DONE.
