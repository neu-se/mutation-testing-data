  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression would be evaluated before the `1,` operator, so the code would return `a + 1` instead of `1, a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a - 1` expression would be evaluated before the `1,` operator, so the code would return `a - 1` instead of `1, a`.

DONE.
