  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is used as an index in the `this._data` map, and adding 1 to it would cause the code to access a different index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is used as an index in the `this._data` map, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the code to access a different index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is used as an index in the `this._data` map, and converting it to uppercase would cause the code to access a different index.

DONE.
