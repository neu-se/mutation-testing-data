Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the substring to start from index 1 and go to the end of the string, which would incorrectly pluralize words by omitting the first character instead of the last.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last two characters of the word instead of just the last character, leading to incorrect pluralization for words that only need the last character removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last three characters of the word, which would incorrectly pluralize words that only require the last character to be changed, potentially resulting in nonsensical outputs.

DONE.
