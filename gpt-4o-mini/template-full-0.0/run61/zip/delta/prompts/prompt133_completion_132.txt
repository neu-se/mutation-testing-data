Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly assumes that `nextOp` has a `length` property, which may not be defined, leading to potential runtime errors or incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically accesses the `length` of the `insert` property of `nextOp`, which may not be a string or may not exist, thus altering the intended logic of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `retain` property of `nextOp` instead of the length, which could lead to incorrect indexing and unexpected results in the slicing operation.

DONE.
