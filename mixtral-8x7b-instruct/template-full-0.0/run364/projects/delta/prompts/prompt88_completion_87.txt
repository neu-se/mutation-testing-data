 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
newOp.insert !== undefined && lastOp.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any value in `insert` property, not just strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof newOp.insert === 'object' && typeof lastOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require both `insert` properties to be objects, instead of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
newOp.hasOwnProperty('insert') && lastOp.hasOwnProperty('insert')
