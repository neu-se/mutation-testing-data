  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push({ delete: length - 1 });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be applied to one fewer character than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push({ delete: length + 1 });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be applied to one more character than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push({ retain: length });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operation would be applied instead of the intended `delete` operation.

DONE.
