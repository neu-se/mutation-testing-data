  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    return object.dispatch;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a promise that resolves to the result of the callback function, which in this case is the `dispatch` method of `object`. This would effectively replace the `dispatch` method with a promise that resolves to the original method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).done(function () {
    return object.dispatch;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method returns a promise that resolves to the result of the callback function, which in this case is the `dispatch` method of `object`. This would effectively replace the `dispatch` method with a promise that resolves to the original method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fail(function () {
    return object.dispatch;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the
