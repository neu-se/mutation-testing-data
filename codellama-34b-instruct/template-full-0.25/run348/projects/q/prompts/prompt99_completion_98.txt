  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, potentially causing the code to fail silently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error.

DONE.
