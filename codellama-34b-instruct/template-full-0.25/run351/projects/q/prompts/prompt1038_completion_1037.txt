  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer` function is called with an argument of `1`, which would cause it to return a promise that is resolved with the value `1`, rather than a promise that is resolved with a new deferred object. This would cause the `put` method to always resolve with the value `1`, rather than resolving with a new deferred object, which would cause the `get` method to always return the value `1`, rather than returning the value that was passed to the `put` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer` function is called with an argument of `null`, which would cause it to return a promise that is resolved with the value `null`, rather than a promise that is resolved with a new deferred object. This would cause the `put` method to always resolve with the value `null`, rather than resolving with
