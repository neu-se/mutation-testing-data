  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method is called twice, which would cause the absolute value to be calculated twice, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method is called once, but the result is then incremented by 1, which would cause the final result to be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method is called once, but the result is then decremented by 1, which would cause the final result to be different from the original code.

DONE.
