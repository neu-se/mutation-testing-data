  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This change will cause the `writeFile` function to use the `fs.writeFile` method instead of the `fs.writeFileSync` method, which may result in different behavior if the `fs.writeFile` method is not implemented correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise(fs.writeFile)
```
This change will cause the `writeFile` function to use the `fs.writeFile` method instead of the `fs.writeFileSync` method, but it will also wrap the result in a promise, which may cause the function to behave differently if the `fs.writeFile` method is not implemented correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This change will cause the `writeFile` function to use the `fs.writeFileSync` method instead of the `fs.writeFile` method, which
