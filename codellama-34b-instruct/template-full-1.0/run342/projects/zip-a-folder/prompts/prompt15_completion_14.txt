  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the access mode to write-only, potentially causing the program to fail if the file is not writable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass null as the first argument to `access()`, which would likely cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 10, Math.random() * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass random numbers as the first two arguments to `access()`, which would likely cause an `EINVAL` error to be thrown.

DONE.
