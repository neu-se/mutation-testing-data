  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now start counting from 1 instead of 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now start counting from the argument length instead of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now start counting from a random number between 0 and 100 instead of 2.

DONE.
