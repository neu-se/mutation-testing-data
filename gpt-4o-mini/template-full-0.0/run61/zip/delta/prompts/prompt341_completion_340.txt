Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operation since the subsequent logic expects to consume the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(1)` retrieves only one operation, which may not be sufficient if the expected operation is larger, leading to incomplete processing of the intended operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(0)` effectively does nothing and returns an empty operation, which would disrupt the logic that relies on processing a valid operation, potentially causing unexpected results in the transformation.

DONE.
