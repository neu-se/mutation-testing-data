  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one more time than it should, potentially accessing an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one fewer time than it should, potentially missing an iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times as it should, potentially causing the loop to never terminate.

DONE.
