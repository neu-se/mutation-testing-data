  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `attributes` when the `Object.keys(attributes)` array is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `attributes` when the `Object.keys(attributes)` array is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length === 0 ? undefined : attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `attributes` when the `Object.keys(attributes)` array is empty.

DONE.
