  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toLocaleString
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toLocaleString` will return a string representing the process in the current locale, rather than "[object process]".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toLocaleDateString
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toLocaleDateString` will return a string representing the process's start date in the current locale, rather than "[object process]".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toLocaleTimeString
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.toLocaleTimeString` will return a string representing the process's start time in the current locale, rather than "[object process]".

DONE.
