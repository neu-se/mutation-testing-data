  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
this.ops.splice(index, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove 1 element from the array starting at the specified index, while the original code fragment only replaces the element at the specified index without removing any elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
this.ops.splice(index - 1, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the newOp element at the specified index, while the original code fragment replaces the element at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
this.ops.splice(index + 1, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the newOp element at the specified index plus one, while the original code fragment replaces the element at the specified index.

DONE.
