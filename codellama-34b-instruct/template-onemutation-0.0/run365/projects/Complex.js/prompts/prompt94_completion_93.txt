  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number. In this case, the code is checking if the value is not a number, so using `isFinite` instead would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
