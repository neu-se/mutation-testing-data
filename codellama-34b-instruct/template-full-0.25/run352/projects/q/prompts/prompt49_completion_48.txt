  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw e;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was inside a `try` block, and the `throw` statement would cause the code to jump to the `catch` block, whereas the new code fragment would cause the code to jump to the `finally` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was throwing an error with a specific message, whereas the new code fragment would throw an error with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("This is a different log message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was throwing an error, whereas the new code fragment would log a message to the console.

DONE.
