  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`. This would cause the `read` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, instead of `abort`, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.
