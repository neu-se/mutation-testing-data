  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if `a` is equal to 0 instead of `b`. This change may cause the function to return an incorrect result if `a` is 0, but it will not cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if `b` is equal to 1 instead of 0. This change may cause the function to return an incorrect result if `b` is 1, but it will not cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This code fragment is different from the original, but it checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is equal to 0. This change may cause the function to return an incorrect result if `a` and `b` are both non-zero,
