  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(clothes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `games` and `clothes` arrays would be concatenated together, resulting in a new array with the elements of both arrays. In the original code, the `games` and `clothes` arrays were separated by a `|` character, which would result in a different regular expression pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(games)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clothes` and `games` arrays would be concatenated together in the opposite order, resulting in a different regular expression pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(clothes).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenated array would be reversed, resulting in a different regular expression pattern.

DONE.
