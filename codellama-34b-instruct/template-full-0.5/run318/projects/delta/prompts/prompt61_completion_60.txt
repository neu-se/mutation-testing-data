  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks that `attributes` is not only not null, but also an object with at least one key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
