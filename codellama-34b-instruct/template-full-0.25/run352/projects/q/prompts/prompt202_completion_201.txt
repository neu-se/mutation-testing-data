  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value is present in the string, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new string containing the specified range of characters, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

DONE.
