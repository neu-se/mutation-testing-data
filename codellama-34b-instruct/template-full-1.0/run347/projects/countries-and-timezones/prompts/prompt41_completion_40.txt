  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prev` was an object, but the new code fragment `prev = {}` would replace it with an empty object, causing the `Object.assign()` function to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prev` was an object, but the new code fragment `prev || {}` would create a new object if `prev` was null or undefined, causing the `Object.assign()` function to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prev` was an object, but the new code fragment `prev.length = 0` would set the `length` property of `prev` to 0, causing the `Object.assign()` function to produce a different result.
