  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the count from the second newline character in the string, instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start + newline.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the count from the first newline character in the string plus the length of the newline, instead of from the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline + start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend the newline character to the start index, instead of starting the count from the position after the newline character.

DONE.
