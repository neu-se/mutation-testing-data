  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for a function with more than one argument, regardless of the actual values of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0] > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the first argument to the number 1, rather than comparing the length of the `arguments` object to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` only if the `arguments` object has exactly one element, rather than more than one.

DONE.
