Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `pageurl_path` instead of the `linkurl_path`, potentially leading to incorrect identification of the URL level relationship.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path + "/extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an extra segment to the `linkurl_path`, which would cause the comparison to fail, incorrectly categorizing the URL relationship.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes a trailing slash from the `linkurl_path`, which could affect the comparison logic and lead to incorrect URL level classification.

DONE.
