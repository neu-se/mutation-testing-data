  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the objects in the `Object.keys()` method, which could potentially change the resulting `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a` and `b` instead of comparing them, which could potentially change the resulting `attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the values of `b` from `a` instead of comparing them, which could potentially change the resulting `attributes` object.

DONE.
