 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares a new constant variable instead of using the existing let variable, making it impossible to modify the value of index in the for loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the index to 1, skipping the first element in the for loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window.index = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the index variable as a global variable, which can be accessed and modified from other parts of the code, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

DONE.
