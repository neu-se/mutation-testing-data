  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing the `promise` and `args` variables to the `descriptor[op]` function, while the buggy code fragment is passing the `promise` and `args` variables as a single argument. This could cause the `descriptor[op]` function to behave differently, potentially leading to different behavior in the overall code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passing the `promise` and `args` variables to the `descriptor[op]` function, while the buggy code fragment is only passing the `promise` variable. This could cause the `descriptor[op]` function to behave differently, potentially leading to different behavior in the overall code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
