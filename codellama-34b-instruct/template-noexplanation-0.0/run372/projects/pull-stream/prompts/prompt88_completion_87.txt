  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This code fragment is a property access expression that accesses the `foo` property of the `prop` object. If the `prop` object does not have a `foo` property, this expression will throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop[0]
```
This code fragment is a property access expression that accesses the property with the key `0` of the `prop` object. If the `prop` object does not have a property with the key `0`, this expression will throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.bar
```
This code fragment is a property access expression that accesses the `bar` property of the `prop` object. If the `prop` object does not have a `bar` property, this expression will throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
