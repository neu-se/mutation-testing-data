  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that invokes the original function with the `this` context set to `undefined`. Using `uncurryThis.bind(undefined)` would cause the `this` context to be set to `undefined` for the `uncurryThis` function itself, which would likely result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a function, and therefore cannot be invoked with the `()` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a function, and therefore cannot be invoked with the `()` operator.

DONE.
