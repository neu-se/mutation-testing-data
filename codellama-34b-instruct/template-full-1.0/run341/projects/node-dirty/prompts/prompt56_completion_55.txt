  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => console.log('DONE')
```
This would result in different behavior because currently the close function would be called to signal that the dirty connection is done and close the streams, but with this mutation, it only just logs 'DONE' instead without calling the close function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because currently the close function would be called to signal that the dirty connection is done and close the streams, but with this mutation, it would clear all the data stored in the map instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => process.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because currently the close function would be called to signal that the dirty connection is done and close the streams, but with this mutation, it would exit the process without calling the close function at all.

DONE.
