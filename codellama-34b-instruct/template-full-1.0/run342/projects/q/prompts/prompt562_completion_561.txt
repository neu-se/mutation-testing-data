  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because Q returns a promise, while void returns nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because Q returns a promise, while undefined indicates that the return value is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Error!")
```
This would result in different behavior because Q returns a promise, while console.log() logs a message to the console and does not return a value.

DONE.
