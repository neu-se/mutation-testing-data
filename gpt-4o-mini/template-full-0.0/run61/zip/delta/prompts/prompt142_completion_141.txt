Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstLeft + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow one additional character to be processed, potentially leading to an off-by-one error in the composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to attempt to process one more character than intended, which could lead to unexpected results in the composed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the number of characters processed, potentially omitting necessary operations from the final composed delta, leading to data loss.

DONE.
