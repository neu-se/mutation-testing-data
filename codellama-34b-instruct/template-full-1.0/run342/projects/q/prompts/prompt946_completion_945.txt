  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a method that resolves the deferred promise, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a callback function that can be used to resolve the promise when called with a value or an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a method that rejects the deferred promise, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a callback function that can be used to resolve the promise when called with a value or an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is a property that returns the resolved value of the deferred promise, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a callback function that can be used to resolve the promise when called with a value or an error.
