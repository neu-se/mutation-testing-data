  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw an error when trying to access the `dispatch` method on `null`, whereas the original code would have used the `dispatch` method on the resolved value of `Q(object)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw an error when trying to access the `dispatch` method on `undefined`, whereas the original code would have used the `dispatch` method on the resolved value of `Q(object)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw an error when trying to access the `dispatch` method on `true`, whereas the original code would have used the `dispatch` method on the resolved value of `Q(object)`.

DONE.
