  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so if `abort` is truthy, the `if` statement would not be executed, and if `abort` is falsy, the `if` statement would be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `abort` is not strictly equal to `true`, the `if` statement would not be executed, and if `abort` is strictly equal to `true`, the `if` statement would be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if `abort` is not strictly equal to `false`, the `if` statement would be executed, and if `abort`
