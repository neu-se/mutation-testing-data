 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always assume that the next operation in the `otherIter` is a 'delete' operation, which might not be the case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the type of the next operation in the `thisIter`, instead of the `otherIter`, which might not be the correct one to consider in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always assume that the next operation in the `otherIter` is a 'retain' operation, which might not be the case.

DONE.
