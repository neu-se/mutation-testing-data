  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `this` value to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [undefined, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the `this` value to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `args` as the `this` value to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
