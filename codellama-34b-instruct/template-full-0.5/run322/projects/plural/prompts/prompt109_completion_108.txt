  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'i'), function(w) { return w + 'es' }

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged if it matches any of the words in the `tools`, `clothes`, `games`, `illnesses`, or `misc` arrays, while the new code fragment appends "es" to the word if it matches any of those words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
