  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment checks for inequality. This would cause the `join` method to reject the promise even if the values are the same, which would lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `join` method.

DONE.
