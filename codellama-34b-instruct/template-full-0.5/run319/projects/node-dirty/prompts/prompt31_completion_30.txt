  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the key to `undefined`, while this new code fragment sets the value of the key to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, val, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a callback function as the third argument, while this new code fragment passes `null` as the third argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, val, () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a callback function as the third argument, while this new code fragment passes an empty function as the third argument.

DONE.
