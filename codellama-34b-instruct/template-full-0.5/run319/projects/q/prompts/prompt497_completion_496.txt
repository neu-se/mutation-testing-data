  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `reason` string with the number `1`, resulting in a different value being passed to `untrackRejection`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `reason` string to uppercase, resulting in a different value being passed to `untrackRejection`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `reason` string into an array of individual characters, resulting in a different value being passed to `untrackRejection`.

DONE.
