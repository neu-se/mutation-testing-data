  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the order of the variables in the `a, b` tuple, which could cause errors in the code that relies on the specific order of the tuple.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b, a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add and subtract the values of `a` and `b`, which could change the results of mathematical operations that rely on the original values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b, a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply and divide the values of `a` and `b`, which could change the results of mathematical operations that rely on the original values.

DONE.
