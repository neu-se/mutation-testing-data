  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.call(arguments)` would return a new array containing the elements of `arguments`, whereas `array_slice` would return a new array containing the elements of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice()` would return a new array containing the elements of `arguments`, whereas `array_slice` would return a new array containing the elements of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice.call(arguments)` would return a new array containing the elements of `arguments`, whereas `array_slice` would return a new array containing the elements of `this`.

DONE.
