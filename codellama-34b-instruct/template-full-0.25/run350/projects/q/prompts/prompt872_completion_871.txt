  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, whereas `Q` would simply return a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` would create a new deferred object, whereas `Q` would simply return a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` would return a promise that is resolved with the value of the promise returned by the callback, whereas `Q` would simply return a new promise.

DONE.
