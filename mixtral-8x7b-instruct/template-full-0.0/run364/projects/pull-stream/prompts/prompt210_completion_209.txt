 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would not be called, even if the iteration is aborted. Originally, the `abortCb` function is called with the `aborted` value, which allows any further processing of the aborted data to happen.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` value would not be passed to the `abortCb` function, but instead, the `data` would be passed. This change would cause any further processing of the aborted data to be performed with the actual data, instead of acknowledging the abortion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { cb(null, data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of directly calling the `cb` function, a new function would be created and assigned to `abortCb`. This change would cause the `abort
