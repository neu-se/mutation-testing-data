  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `undefined`, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, function(error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the same error, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
