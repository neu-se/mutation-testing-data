  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `abort` variable is truthy, the first argument passed to the `read` function would be `false` instead of `true`, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || 0, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `abort` variable is truthy, the first argument passed to the `read` function would be `0` instead of `true`, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || null, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `abort` variable is truthy, the first argument passed to the `read` function would be `null` instead of `true`, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
