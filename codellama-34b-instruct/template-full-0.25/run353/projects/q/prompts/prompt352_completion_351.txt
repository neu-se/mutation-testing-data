  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfilled` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `rejected` is a function that returns a rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `rejected` is a function that returns a rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("rejected")` would throw an error, whereas `rejected` is a function that returns a rejection.

DONE.
