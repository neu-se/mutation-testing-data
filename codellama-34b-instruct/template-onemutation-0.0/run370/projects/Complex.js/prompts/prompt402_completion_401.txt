  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logHypot(x['re'], x['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `logHypot` is a function that calculates the hypotenuse of a complex number, but the original code fragment uses `Math.atan2` to calculate the argument of the complex number.

DONE.
