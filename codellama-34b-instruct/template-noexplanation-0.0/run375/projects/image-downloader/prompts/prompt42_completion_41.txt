  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request timed out.')
```
This code fragment creates a new `Error` object with the message "Request timed out." This is different from the original code fragment, which created a `TimeoutError` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request failed.')
```
This code fragment creates a new `Error` object with the message "Request failed." This is different from the original code fragment, which created a `TimeoutError` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request timed out.')
```
This code fragment creates a new `Error` object with the message "Request timed out." This is the same as the first option, but it uses a different constructor function.

DONE.
