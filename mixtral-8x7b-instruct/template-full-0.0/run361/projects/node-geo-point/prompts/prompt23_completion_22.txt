 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `GeoPoint.fromObject` method would now expect an object with `longitude` and `longitude` properties instead of `latitude` and `longitude`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'altitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `GeoPoint.fromObject` method would now expect an object with `latitude` and `altitude` properties, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'elevation'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `GeoPoint.fromObject` method would now expect an object with `latitude` and `elevation` properties, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

By introducing these changes, we can test the effectiveness of the test suite in catching unexpected behavior due to changes in
