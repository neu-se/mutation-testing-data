  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * 2` is a different expression than `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(b)` is a different expression than `b`.

DONE.
