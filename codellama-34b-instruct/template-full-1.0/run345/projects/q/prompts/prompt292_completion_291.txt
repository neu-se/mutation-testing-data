  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the notification function to be called immediately, rather than being passed as a parameter to the resolver function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(progress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the notification function to be called with the `progress` argument, which is not what the original code was doing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(progress, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the notification function to be called with the `progress` and `value` arguments, which is not what the original code was doing.

DONE.
