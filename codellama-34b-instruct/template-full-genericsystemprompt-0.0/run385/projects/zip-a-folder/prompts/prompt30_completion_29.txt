  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called when an error occurs, rather than when the stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called when the stream ends, rather than when the stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called when the stream is finished, rather than when the stream is closed.

DONE.
