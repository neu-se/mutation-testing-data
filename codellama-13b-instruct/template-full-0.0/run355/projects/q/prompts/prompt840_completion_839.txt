  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be bound to the `this` context, which would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to be called with a different context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with the `this` context, which would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to be called with a different context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with the `this` context, which would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to be called with a different context.

DONE.
