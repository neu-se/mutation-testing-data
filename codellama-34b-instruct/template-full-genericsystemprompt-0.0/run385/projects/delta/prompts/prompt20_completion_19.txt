  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the base attribute map instead of the attribute map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the attribute value to itself instead of the base attribute value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the attribute value to the base attribute value instead of the attribute value to itself.

DONE.
