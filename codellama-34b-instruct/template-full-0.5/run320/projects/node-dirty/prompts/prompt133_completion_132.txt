  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue` and `this._data` are different objects, and the `delete` method would be called on the wrong object, potentially causing the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from the queue, while `delete` removes the specified element from the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from the queue, while `delete` removes the specified element from the queue.

DONE.
