  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value != null && typeof value !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if `value` is not a promise or it's a fulfilled promise, while this fragment would return `true` if `value` is not a promise or it's not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if `value` is not a promise or it's a fulfilled promise, while this fragment would return `true` only if `value` is an instance of `Promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value ? value.then : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if `value` is not a promise or it's a fulfilled promise, while this fragment would return `true` if `value` is a promise with a
