  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.length` is a different value than `self`, which would cause the `map` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `self[0]` is a different value than `self`, which would cause the `map` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.slice(1)` is a different value than `self`, which would cause the `map` function to behave differently.

DONE.
