 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` would be `undefined` when `row.val` is `undefined`, which could cause issues in the code that expects a defined key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` would be `0` when `row.val` is `undefined`, which could cause issues in the code that expects a string key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys().next().value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` would always be the first key in the `_data` map, instead of the key from the current row being processed. This would cause incorrect data to be loaded into the `_data` map.

DONE.
