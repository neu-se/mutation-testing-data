 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the current and all arrays with the specific id instead of empty arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: result.current, all: result.all } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the parent object's properties instead of initializing new arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: data.timezones[id].r, all: data.timezones[id].r } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly references the r property of the timezone object instead of using the original logic.

DONE.
