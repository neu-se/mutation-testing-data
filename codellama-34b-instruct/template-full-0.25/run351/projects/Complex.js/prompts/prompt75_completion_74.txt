  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, and the first element of the array would be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at -1 instead of 0, and the last element of the array would be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 0.5 instead of 0, and the first element of the array would be skipped.

DONE.
