  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas `next` advances the iterator and returns the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(2)` advances the iterator by 2 operations, whereas `next()` advances the iterator by 1 operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(otherIter.peekLength())` advances the iterator by the length of the next operation, whereas `next()` advances the iterator by 1 operation.

DONE.
