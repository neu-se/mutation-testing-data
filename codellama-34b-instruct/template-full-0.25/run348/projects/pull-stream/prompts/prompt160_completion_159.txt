  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, whereas `null` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", whereas `null` is a null reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is an empty string, whereas `null` is a null reference.

DONE.
