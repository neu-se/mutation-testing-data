  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\ufeff/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function removes the UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the beginning of the file, while the `replace` method would replace any occurrence of the BOM with an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function removes the first character of the file, while the `slice` method would remove the first character and return the remaining characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function removes the first character of the file, while the `substring` method would remove the first character and return the remaining characters.

DONE.
