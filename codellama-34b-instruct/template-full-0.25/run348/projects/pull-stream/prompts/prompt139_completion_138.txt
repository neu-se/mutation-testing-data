  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `null` is a null value. The `if` statement would evaluate to `true` for `null`, which would cause the function to return `cb(null)` instead of `cb(end)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `undefined` is a special value that indicates the absence of a value. The `if` statement would evaluate to `true` for `undefined`, which would cause the function to return `cb(undefined)` instead of `cb(end)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `0` is a number value. The `if` statement would evaluate to `false` for `0`, which would cause the function
