  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/^\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is different. The original code fragment replaces the last occurrence of "/index." followed by any number of lowercase letters, while the new code fragment replaces the last occurrence of "/default." followed by any number of lowercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/^\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different. The original code fragment replaces the last occurrence of "/index." followed by any number of lowercase letters with "/", while the new code fragment replaces the last occurrence of "/default." followed by any number of lowercase letters with an empty string.

Option 3:
