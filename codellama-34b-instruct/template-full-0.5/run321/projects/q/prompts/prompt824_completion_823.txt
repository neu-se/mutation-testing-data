  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a different error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject("This is a different rejection");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve("This is a different resolution");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a different value.

DONE.
