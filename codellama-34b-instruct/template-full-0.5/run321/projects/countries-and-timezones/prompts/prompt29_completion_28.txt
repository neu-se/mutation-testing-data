  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides the offset by 60, while this code fragment takes the remainder of the offset divided by 60. This would cause the resulting offset to be different in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides the offset by 60, while this code fragment adds 60 to the offset. This would cause the resulting offset to be different in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides the offset by 60, while this code fragment subtracts 60 from the offset. This would cause the resulting offset to be different in some cases.

DONE.
