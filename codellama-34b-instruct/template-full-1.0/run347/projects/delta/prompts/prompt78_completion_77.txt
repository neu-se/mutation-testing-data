  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.attributes === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `attributes` property of `lastOp` is a number, which is not necessarily the same as checking if `lastOp` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'object' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both `newOp.delete` and `lastOp.delete` are objects, which is not necessarily the same as checking if they are both numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete !== 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either `newOp.delete` or `lastOp.delete` is not a number, which is the opposite of
