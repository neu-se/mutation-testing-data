  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would now calculate the destination point for a bearing that is twice the original bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would now calculate the destination point for a bearing that is the negative of the original bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would now calculate the destination point for a bearing that is the absolute value of the original bearing.

DONE.
