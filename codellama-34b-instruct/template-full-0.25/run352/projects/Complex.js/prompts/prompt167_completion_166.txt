  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method checks if the complex number is infinite, while the `isZero` method checks if the complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if the complex number is not a number (NaN), while the `isZero` method checks if the complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method checks if the complex number is zero, while the `isInfinite` method checks if the complex number is infinite. The `&&` operator would return `true` if both conditions are met, which would result in different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
