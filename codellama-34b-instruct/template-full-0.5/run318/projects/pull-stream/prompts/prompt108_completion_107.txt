  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a function, and `cb !== undefined` will always be true, even if `cb` is not a function. This would cause the code to enter the `if` block and assign `acc` to `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof cb` will always be `'function'`, even if `cb` is not a function. This would cause the code to enter the `if` block and assign `acc` to `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.constructor !== Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb.constructor` will always be `Function`, even if `cb` is not a function. This would cause the code to enter the `if` block and assign `acc` to `null`,
