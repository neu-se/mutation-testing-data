  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `nodeback` variable, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `nodeback`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, or vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `nodeback` would be evaluated, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`, or vice versa.

DONE.
