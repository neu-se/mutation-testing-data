Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path being checked from the parent directory of `dest` to `dest` itself, potentially causing incorrect results when checking if `dest` is a subdirectory of `src`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path being checked from the parent directory of `dest` to `src`, causing the function to always return immediately without checking the actual parent directories of `dest`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.parse(srcParent)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path being checked from the parent directory of `dest` to the parent directory of `src`, potentially causing incorrect results when checking if `dest` is a subdirectory of `src`.

DONE.
