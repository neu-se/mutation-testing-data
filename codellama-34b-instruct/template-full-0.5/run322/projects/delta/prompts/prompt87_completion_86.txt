  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes || lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `lastOp.attributes`, even if `newOp.attributes` is not null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `lastOp.attributes`, even if `newOp.attributes` is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes ?? lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `??` operator would always return `lastOp.attributes`, even if `newOp.attributes` is null or undefined.

DONE.
