 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `basis` value would be incremented by 1 before being returned, which is different from the original behavior of simply returning the `callback`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { callback(); }
