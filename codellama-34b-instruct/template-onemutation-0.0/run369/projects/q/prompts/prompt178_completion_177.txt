  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for any stack line that contains the string "(module.js:", which would cause the `filterStackString` function to remove those lines from the stack trace.

DONE.
