  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the latitude instead of the longitude to the `toTile` method, which would cause the method to return a different tile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the longitude instead of the latitude to the `toTile` method, which would cause the method to return a different tile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + this.longitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the sum of the latitude and longitude to the `toTile` method, which would cause the method to return a different tile.

DONE.
