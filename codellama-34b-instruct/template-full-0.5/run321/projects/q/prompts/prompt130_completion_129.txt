  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would return an array of values instead of an array of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would return an array of values instead of an array of keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would return an array of keys with an offset of 1.

DONE.
