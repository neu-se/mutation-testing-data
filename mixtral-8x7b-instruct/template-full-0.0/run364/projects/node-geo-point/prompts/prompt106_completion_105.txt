 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 ** zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the bitwise exponentiation operator (`**`) instead of the `Math.pow` function, which may produce different results for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the third argument of `Math.pow` (the modulus), which is not present in the original code. This would change the behavior of the function for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(zoom, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments to `Math.pow`, which would change the behavior of the function for certain inputs.

DONE.
