 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now passes an integer instead of a function as the second argument to `pull`, which would cause the function to behave differently or even throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now passes `null` instead of a function as the second argument to `pull`, which would cause the function to behave differently or even throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now passes an empty function instead of the original `read` function as the second argument to `pull`, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
