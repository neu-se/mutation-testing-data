  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== a` will always be false, even if `a` is `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === a` will always be true, even if `a` is `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b === a + b` will always be true, even if `a` or `b` is `NaN`.

DONE.
