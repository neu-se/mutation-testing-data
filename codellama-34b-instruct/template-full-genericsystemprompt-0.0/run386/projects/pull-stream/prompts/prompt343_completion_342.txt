  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` instead of the original `abort` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` instead of the original `abort` value, and it would also negate the condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` instead of the original `abort` value, and it would also negate the condition.

DONE.
