  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This will cause the promise to resolve instead of reject, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This will cause the promise to reject with a new error message, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.emit('error', new Error('Something went wrong'))
```
This will cause the promise to reject with a new error message, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
