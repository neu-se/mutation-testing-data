  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is always truthy, so the `while` loop would never exit.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` condition would always be true, so the `while` loop would never exit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test(data)` function would always return `true`, so the `while` loop would never exit.

DONE.
