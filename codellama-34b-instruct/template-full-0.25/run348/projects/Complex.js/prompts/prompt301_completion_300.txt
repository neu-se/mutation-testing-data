  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function, which has a different range and output values than `cosh`, the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, which has a different range and output values than `cosh`, the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt(1 - cosh(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because `sqrt(1 - cosh(b))` is the square root of the difference between 1 and the hyperbolic cosine of `b`, which has a different range and output values than `cosh`, the hyperbolic cosine function.

DONE.
