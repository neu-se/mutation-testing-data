  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is not defined in the function, and the `_has_illegal_chars` function is not defined either.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrlStr` variable is defined in the function, but the `_has_illegal_chars` function is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(parsedUrl.host)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl.host` variable is defined in the function, but the `_has_illegal_chars` function is not defined.

DONE.
