  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.pop` would remove the last element of the `nodeArgs` array, whereas `nodeArgs.push` would add an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.shift` would remove the first element of the `nodeArgs` array, whereas `nodeArgs.push` would add an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the `nodeArgs` array, whereas `nodeArgs.push` would add an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
