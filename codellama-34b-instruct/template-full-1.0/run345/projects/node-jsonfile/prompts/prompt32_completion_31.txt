  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + obj, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would always return a numerical value, regardless of the type of `obj`. In the original code, `obj` is an object and the `+` operator would not be applicable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString(), options
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.toString()` would return a string representation of the `obj` object, whereas the original code would pass the `obj` object as-is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof obj, options
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` would always return a string value, regardless of the type of `obj`. In the original code, `obj` could be of any type, and the `typeof` operator would not be applicable.

DONE.
