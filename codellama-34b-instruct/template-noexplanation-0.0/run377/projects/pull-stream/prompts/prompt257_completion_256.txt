  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === true
```
This code fragment checks if the `err` variable is equal to the boolean value `true`. If the `err` variable is not a boolean, this code will not behave as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== null
```
This code fragment checks if the `err` variable is not equal to the `null` value. If the `err` variable is not a boolean, this code will not behave as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && err.message
```
This code fragment checks if the `err` variable is not `null` or `undefined`, and if it has a `message` property. If the `err` variable is not an object, this code will not behave as expected.

DONE.
