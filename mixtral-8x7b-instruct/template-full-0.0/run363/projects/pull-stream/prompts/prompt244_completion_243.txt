 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { read() }
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `read` function with an anonymous function, which could affect the behavior of the `abort` parameter and the error handling within the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the local variable `_read` instead of the argument `read`, potentially causing issues if `_read` has not been initialized or has a different value than the intended `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies the `values` function to the `read` argument, which is likely not the intended behavior and could cause issues if the `read` argument is not an array or an object with an iterable `values` method.

DONE.
