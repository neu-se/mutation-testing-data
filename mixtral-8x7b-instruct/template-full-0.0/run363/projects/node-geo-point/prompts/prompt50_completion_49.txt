 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.atan(Δλ / Math.tan(φ2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the tangent addition formula instead of atan2, which can lead to incorrect results when Δλ is negative and φ2 is close to ±π/2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.asin(Math.sin(φ1) * Math.cos(δ) + Math.cos(φ1) * Math.sin(δ) * Math.cos(θ))
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calculates φ2 using the haversine formula, but without considering the edge case when the result is ±π/2. This can lead to incorrect results when the distance between two points is large.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.PI / 2 - Math.acos(Math.sin(φ1) * Math.sin(φ
