  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing relative to the equator, while this code fragment calculates the bearing relative to the prime meridian.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points on the surface of a sphere, while this code fragment calculates the double of the same bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not consider the modulo 360 operation, while this code fragment does, which could result in different outputs.

DONE.
