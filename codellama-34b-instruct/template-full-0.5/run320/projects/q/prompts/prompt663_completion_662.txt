  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array of arguments as the second argument, whereas `post` expects an array of arguments as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` expects an array of arguments as the second argument, whereas `apply` expects an array of arguments as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` expects an array of arguments as the second argument, whereas `apply` expects an array of arguments as the first argument.

DONE.
