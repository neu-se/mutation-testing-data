  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is defined as a Mathematical function, while `+` is defined as a logical operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
*
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is defined as a Mathematical function, while `*` is defined as a logical operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
||
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is defined as a Mathematical function, while `||` is defined as a logical operator.

DONE.
