  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$("a").text()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of all "a" elements, rather than just the current element being iterated over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the current element being iterated over, rather than all "a" elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$("a").eq(i).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the "a" element at the current index "i", rather than all "a" elements.

DONE.
