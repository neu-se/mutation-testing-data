  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `data` argument, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as both arguments, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `true` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
