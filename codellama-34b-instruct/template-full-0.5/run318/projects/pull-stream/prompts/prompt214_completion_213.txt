  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the `err` variable, which means that the code would execute the `else` block even if there was an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` variable would be evaluated as a boolean value, and if it is truthy, the `data` variable would be evaluated as well. If `data` is falsy, the `else` block would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err || data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` variable would be evaluated as a boolean value, and if it is falsy, the `data` variable would be evaluated as well. If `data` is truthy, the `else` block would not be executed.

DONE.
