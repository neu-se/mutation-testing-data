  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation in the list instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the previous operation in the list instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the operation after the next one in the list instead of the current one.

DONE.
