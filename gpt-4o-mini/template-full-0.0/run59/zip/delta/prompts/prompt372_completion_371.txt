Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds 1 to the length of the operation, potentially causing an off-by-one error in the retention of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the operation returned by `next()` instead of the length of the operation currently being peeked, which could lead to incorrect retention of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly subtracts 1 from the length of the operation, which could lead to missing or incorrectly processing the last character of an insert operation.

DONE.
