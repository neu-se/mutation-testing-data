  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>;
```
This would result in different behavior because the generator would immediately return the yielded value, instead of proceeding to the next iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (true) <PLACEHOLDER>;
```
This would result in different behavior because the generator would get stuck in an infinite loop, as the `while` loop would never exit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Boom!");
```
This would result in different behavior because the generator would immediately throw an error, causing the promise chain to be rejected.

DONE.
