  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function() {
  throw new Error("test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning the rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function() {
  return Promise.reject("test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with a different reason instead of returning the original rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function() {
  return Promise.resolve("test");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a resolved promise with a different value instead of returning the original rejected promise.

DONE.
