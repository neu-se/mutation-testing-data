  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.E` is a mathematical constant representing Euler's number, whereas `Math.sqrt` is a function that calculates the square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a variable representing the real part of the complex number, whereas `Math.sqrt` expects a numerical argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is a function that calculates the absolute value of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` expects a numerical argument.

DONE.
