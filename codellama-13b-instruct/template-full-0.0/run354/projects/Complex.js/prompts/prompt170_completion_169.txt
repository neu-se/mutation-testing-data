  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is used to check if the complex number is infinite, while the original code fragment uses the `isZero` method to check if the complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method is used to check if the complex number is not a number (NaN), while the original code fragment uses the `isZero` method to check if the complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isReal']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isReal` method is used to check if the complex number is real, while the original code fragment uses the `isZero` method to check if the complex number is zero.

DONE.
