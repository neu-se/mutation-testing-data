 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0 && this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logical operator from OR to AND, which would cause the `_flush` method to only run if both `_queue.size` is 0 and `_waitForDrain` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._queue.size && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates both `_queue.size` and `_waitForDrain`, which would cause the `_flush` method to only run if both are false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length === 0 && this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the `length` property instead of the `size` property, which may not have the same value depending on the implementation of the `Queue` class.
