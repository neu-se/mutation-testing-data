  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is not a property of the `Map` object in JavaScript, while `size` is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', Object.keys(this._data).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of the keys in the `Map` object, while `size` is a property that returns the number of key-value pairs in the `Map`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value that is twice the actual size of the `Map`, which could cause issues in the code that is listening for the `load` event.

DONE.
