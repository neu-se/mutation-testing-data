  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.chop(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include an argument for the `chop` method, while the mutated code fragment includes an argument of `1`. This could potentially cause the `chop` method to behave differently, such as removing a different number of characters from the `delta` object.
