  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error('error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event instead of the intended event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a different message than the intended event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a drain event instead of the intended event.

DONE.
