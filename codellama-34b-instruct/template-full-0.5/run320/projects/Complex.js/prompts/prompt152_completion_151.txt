  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] && z['re'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checked if the number was infinite, while this code fragment also checks if the real part of the number is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] || z['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checked if the number was infinite, while this code fragment also checks if the imaginary part of the number is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] && z['re'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checked if the number was infinite, while this code fragment also checks if the real part of the number is less than 0.

DONE.
