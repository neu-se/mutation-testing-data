  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is set to an error object in the `if(aborted)` block. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `if(aborted)` block to be skipped, and the code would continue to the `else` block, which would call the `map` function with the `data` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is set to an error object in the `if(aborted)` block. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `if(aborted)` block to be skipped, and the code would continue to the `else` block, which would call the `map` function with the `data` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because
