  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isNaN` function, so if the original code fragment was checking if a value was not a number, the modified code fragment would check if it is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks if a value is a finite number, while the `isNaN` function checks if a value is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isNaN` function is a static method of the `Number` object that checks if a value is not a number, while the `isNaN` function is a global function that checks if a value is not a number.

DONE.
