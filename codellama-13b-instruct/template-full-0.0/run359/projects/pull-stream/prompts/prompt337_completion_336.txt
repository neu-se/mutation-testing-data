  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.id
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` object is not defined in the current scope, and the `id` function is not a property of the `prop` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.id()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` object is not defined in the current scope, and the `id` function is not a property of the `prop` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.id(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` object is not defined in the current scope, and the `id` function is not a property of the `prop` object.

DONE.
