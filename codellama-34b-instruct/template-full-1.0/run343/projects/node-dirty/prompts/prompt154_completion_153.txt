  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork()` method will always be called, even if `this._queue.size` is 0, which could cause data to be written to the file even if it's not supposed to.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork()` method will always be called with an argument of 1, which could cause data to be written to the file in a way that is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(new Error('dummy'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork()` method will be called with a dummy error object, which could cause data to be written to the file in a way that is not intended.

DONE.
