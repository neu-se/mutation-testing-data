  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method that searches for a match in a string, whereas `match` is a method that checks if a string matches a regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because `/[^/]+/` is a regular expression that matches any character that is not a forward slash, whereas `spec.match` is a method that checks if a string matches a regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a method that replaces a match in a string with a replacement string, whereas `match` is a method that checks if a string matches a regular expression.

DONE.
