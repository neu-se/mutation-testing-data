  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `ref` is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[0]` returns the first element of the array, while `ref` is a reference to the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the array, while `ref` is a reference to the entire array.

DONE.
