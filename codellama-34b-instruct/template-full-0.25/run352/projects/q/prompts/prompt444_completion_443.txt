Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.fulfill("intentional fulfillment"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a string, which would trigger the `untrackRejection` function and remove the
