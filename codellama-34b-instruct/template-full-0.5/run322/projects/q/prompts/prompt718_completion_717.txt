  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method is only supposed to return the keys of the object, not the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3].length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is not the same as the number of keys in an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3].slice(0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the specified elements, not the keys of an object.

DONE.
