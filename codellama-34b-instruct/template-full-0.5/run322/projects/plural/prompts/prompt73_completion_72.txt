  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'cellos'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment, which is to add a new rule for the word "cello" and its plural form "cellos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello', 'violons'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new rule for the word "cello" and its plural form "violons", which is different from the original rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'violin', 'violons'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new rule for the word "violin" and its plural form "violons", which is different from the original rule for "cello".

DONE.
