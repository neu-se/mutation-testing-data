  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is being modified, which could affect the outcome of the `test(data)` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is being modified, which could affect the outcome of the `test(data)` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is being modified, which could affect the outcome of the `test(data)` function.

DONE.
