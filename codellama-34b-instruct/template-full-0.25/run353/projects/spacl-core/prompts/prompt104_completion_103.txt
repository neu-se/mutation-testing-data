  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.set` would set the value of the property, whereas `this.get` would retrieve the value of the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.delete` would delete the property, whereas `this.get` would retrieve the value of the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.hasOwnProperty` would check if the property exists, whereas `this.get` would retrieve the value of the property.

DONE.
