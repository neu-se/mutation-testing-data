  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any wildcards from the path specification, which could cause the matcher to incorrectly match paths that contain wildcards.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/\*/g, '+')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace any wildcards in the path specification with the `+` character, which could cause the matcher to incorrectly match paths that contain wildcards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/\*/g, '**')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace any wildcards in the path specification with the `**` characters, which could cause the matcher to incorrectly match paths that contain wildcards.

DONE.
