  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(1), promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the search for the `promise` argument at the second element of the `unhandledRejections` array, instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(-1), promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the search for the `promise` argument at the last element of the `unhandledRejections` array, instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(0, -1), promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for the `promise` argument in the `unhandledRejections` array, but would exclude the last element of the array.

DONE.
