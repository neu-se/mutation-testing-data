  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > 1; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first element of the `arguments` array, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= length; i--;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start from the last element of the `arguments` array and decrement `i` until it is less than or equal to the first element, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = length - 1; i > 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start from the last element of the `arguments` array and decrement `i` until it is equal to 0, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
