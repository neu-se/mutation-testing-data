  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `nmapply` function to pass the arguments to the method in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(array_slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array with the elements of another array, which would cause the `nmapply` function to pass more arguments to the method than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice()` method removes elements from the array, which would cause the `nmapply` function to pass fewer arguments to the method than expected.

DONE.
