  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, and the `rejected` callback is not called when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected or fulfilled, and the `progressed` callback is not called when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected or fulfilled, and the `void 0` callback is not called when the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
