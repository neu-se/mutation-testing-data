 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[aeiou]o|[^aeiou]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches words ending in 'o' preceded by a vowel, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[aeiouy]o/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't match words ending in 'o' when it's not preceded by a vowel, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[aeiouy]o/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the 'g' flag, which changes the behavior of the regular expression to match all occurrences in the string, instead of just the first one.

DONE.
