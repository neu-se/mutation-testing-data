  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/b/` would match a different set of strings than `/a/`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a+/` would match one or more occurrences of the letter "a", whereas `/a/` would match exactly one occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a]/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[^a]/` would match any character that is not "a", whereas `/a/` would match exactly "a".

DONE.
