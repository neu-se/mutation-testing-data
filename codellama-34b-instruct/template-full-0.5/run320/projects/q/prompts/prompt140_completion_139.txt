  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p && p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because `p && p.source` would evaluate to `true` if `p` is truthy and `p.source` is defined, whereas `!!p` would evaluate to `true` only if `p` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p || p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because `p || p.source` would evaluate to `p.source` if `p` is falsy, whereas `!!p` would evaluate to `false` if `p` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p ? p.source : null
```
This would result in different behavior because `p ? p.source : null` would evaluate to `p.source` if `p` is truthy, and `null` if `p` is falsy, whereas `!!p` would evaluate to `true` if `
