  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for the type of the next operation in the other delta, but this replacement would check for the type of the next operation in the current delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for the type of the next operation in the other delta, but this replacement would check for the type of the next operation in the current delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the length of the next operation in the current delta is greater than the length of the next operation in the other delta, but this replacement would check if the length of the next operation in the current delta is greater than the length of the next operation
