  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions || { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzip` option would always be set to `true`, even if it was not specified in the `archiverOptions` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions || { zlib: { level: 9 } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zlib` option would always be set to `level: 9`, even if it was not specified in the `archiverOptions` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions || { store: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `store` option would always be set to `true`, even if it was not specified in the `archiverOptions` object.

DONE.
