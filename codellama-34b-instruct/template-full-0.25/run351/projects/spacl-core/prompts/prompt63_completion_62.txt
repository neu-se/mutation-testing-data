  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method mutates the original array, whereas the original code fragment creates a new array without modifying the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the original array, whereas the original code fragment creates a new array without modifying the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.concat().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method creates a new array by concatenating the original array with an empty array, whereas the original code fragment creates a new array without modifying the original.

DONE.
