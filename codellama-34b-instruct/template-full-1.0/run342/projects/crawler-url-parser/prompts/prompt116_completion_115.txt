  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl => currentUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` parameter is being mutated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl => baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` parameter is being set to `baseUrl`, which is a different URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl => null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` parameter would be set to `null`, which would cause an error when trying to access its `subdomain` property.

DONE.
