  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for 'memo' would be added twice, causing the pluralization of 'memo' to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for 'memo' would be added with the incorrect plural form, causing the pluralization of 'memo' to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for 'memo' would be added with a custom pluralization function that always returns the word 'memos', causing the pluralization of 'memo' to be incorrect.

DONE.
