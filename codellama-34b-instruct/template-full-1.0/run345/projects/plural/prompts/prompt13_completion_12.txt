  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice` would return a portion of the string starting from the first character, whereas `w.substr` would return a portion of the string starting from the first character, but only up to the number of characters specified by the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.toUpperCase
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase` would return the string in all uppercase letters, whereas `substr` would return a portion of the string starting from the first character, but only up to the number of characters specified by the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2 + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.length - 2 + 'ies'` would return the length of the string minus 2, plus the string 'ies', whereas `w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies
