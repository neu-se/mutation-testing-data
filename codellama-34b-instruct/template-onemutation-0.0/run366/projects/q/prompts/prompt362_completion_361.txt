  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is expected to call the `fulfilled` callback when the promise is resolved, but the replaced code would call the `rejected` callback instead, which could cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
