 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { /* empty function */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would not be fulfilled or rejected with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (value) { deferred.resolve(value); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` and `notify` methods would not be called, even if they were set up.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (value) { deferred.reject(value); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would always be rejected with the given value, even if it could be fulfilled.

DONE.
