  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb, abort, onAbort` would call the `cb` function with the `abort` and `onAbort` arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(abort, null)` would call the `cb` function with the `abort` argument and `null` as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb, abort, onAbort` would call the `cb` function with the `abort` and `onAbort` arguments, while the new code fragment `cb(null, abort)` would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument and the `abort` argument as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

cb(onAbort, abort)
