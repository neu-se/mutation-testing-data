  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include the 's' character at the end of the word, which would cause the rule to match words that end in "o" and not just "o" alone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include the 'ies' suffix at the end of the word, which would cause the rule to match words that end in "o" and not just "o" alone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr
