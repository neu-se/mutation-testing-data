  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isInteger` checks if a value is an integer, which is not the same as checking if it is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if a value is an array, which is not the same as checking if it is an integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof point.coordinates === 'object' && point.coordinates.length >= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `point.coordinates` is an object with a length greater than or equal to 2, which is a different check than `Array.isArray(point.coordinates)`.

DONE.
