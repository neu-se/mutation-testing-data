  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] || options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will return the first truthy value, which in this case is `options`, if `countries[id]` is falsy. This change would cause the `getCountry` function to return `options` instead of `countries[id]` when `countries[id]` is falsy, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
