  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp))` would retain the length of the current operation, whereas `delta.retain(Op.length(otherOp))` would retain the length of the other operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain(Op.length(otherOp))` would retain the length of the other operation, whereas `delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp))` would retain the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp) + Op.length(otherOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp) + Op.length(otherOp))` would retain the sum of the
