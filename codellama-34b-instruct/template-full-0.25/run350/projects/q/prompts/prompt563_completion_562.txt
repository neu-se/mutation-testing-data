  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exception` object would be returned instead of the `exception.value` property, which could cause the promise to be resolved with an unexpected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be returned instead of the `exception.value` property, which could cause the promise to be resolved with an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be returned instead of the `exception.value` property, which could cause the promise to be resolved with an unexpected value.

DONE.
