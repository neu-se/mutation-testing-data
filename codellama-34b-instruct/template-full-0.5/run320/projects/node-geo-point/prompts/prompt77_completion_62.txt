  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would calculate the destination point using a different bearing value, which could lead to a different destination point being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would calculate the destination point using a different bearing value, which could lead to a different destination point being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would calculate the destination point using a different bearing value, which could lead to a different destination point being returned.

DONE.
