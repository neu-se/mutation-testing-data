  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition `i > length` is always false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, as the condition `i = length` is only true when `i` is equal to `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i -= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition `i -= 1` is always false.

DONE.
