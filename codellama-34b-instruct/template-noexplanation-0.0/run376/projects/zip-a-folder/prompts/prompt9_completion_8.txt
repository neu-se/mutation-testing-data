  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This code fragment has the same behavior as the original code fragment, which is to check if the `src` variable is a glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This code fragment has the opposite behavior of the original code fragment, which is to check if the `src` variable is not a glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes('*')
```
This code fragment checks if the `src` variable includes the `*` character, which is a common pattern in glob patterns.

DONE.
