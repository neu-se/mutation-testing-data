  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function () { throw new Error('aborted') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would simply return the result of the `read` function, while the mutated code fragment would throw an error if the `read` function returned a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function () { return null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the result of the `read` function, while the mutated code fragment would return `null` if the `read` function returned a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function () { return undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the result of the `read` function, while the mutated code fragment would return `undefined` if the `read` function returned a falsy value.

DONE.
