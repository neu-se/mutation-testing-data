  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the `data` variable, which would change the result of the `JSON.parse` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the `data` variable by 2, which would change the result of the `JSON.parse` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the `data` variable, which would change the result of the `JSON.parse` method.

DONE.
