  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the deg2rad function expects a decimal degree value as input, and the value 1 is not a valid input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+
```
This would result in different behavior because the + operator would attempt to concatenate the string '1' with the next token, rather than performing a mathematical operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
*
```
This would result in different behavior because the * operator would attempt to multiply the string '1' with the next token, rather than performing a mathematical operation.

DONE.
