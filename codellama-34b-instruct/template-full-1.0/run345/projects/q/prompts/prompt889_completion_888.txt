  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments, 1` uses the `,` operator to extract the second argument from the `arguments` object, while `0` would extract the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments, 1` uses the `,` operator to extract the second argument from the `arguments` object, while `null` would extract the first argument and throw an error if the `arguments` object does not have a second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments, 1` uses the `,` operator to extract the second argument from the `arguments` object, while `undefined` would extract the first argument and throw an error if the `arguments` object does not have a second argument.

DONE.
