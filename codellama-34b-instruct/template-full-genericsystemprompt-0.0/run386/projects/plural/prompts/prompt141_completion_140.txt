  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the rule array is the replacement string, not the match pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third element of the rule array is the replacement function, not the match pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth element of the rule array is the replacement function, not the match pattern.

DONE.
