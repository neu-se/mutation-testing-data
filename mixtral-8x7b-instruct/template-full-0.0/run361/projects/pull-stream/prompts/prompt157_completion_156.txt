 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the result of the comparison between `value` and `null` to the callback, while this change would always pass `false` regardless of the comparison result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.apply(null, [null, _value])
