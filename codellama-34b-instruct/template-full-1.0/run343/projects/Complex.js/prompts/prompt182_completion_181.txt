  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the complex number 0, regardless of the value of the complex number `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ONE'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the complex number 1, regardless of the value of the complex number `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['Inf'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the complex number infinity, regardless of the value of the complex number `a`.

DONE.
