  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([result.value])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` would cause the promise to be resolved with an array containing the fulfilled value of `result.value`, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved with the fulfilled value of `result.value` directly.

DONE.
