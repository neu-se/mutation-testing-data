 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x == y
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses abstract equality comparison instead of strict equality comparison. This means that type coercion will occur, which might lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x.valueOf() === y.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `valueOf` method, which might return a different value than the original object. This could lead to false negatives in the comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.is(x, y)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Object.is` method, which is a stricter version of the `===` operator. It will return `false` for `-0` and `+0`, and for `NaN` and `NaN`. This might not be the desired behavior, depending on the use case.

DONE.
