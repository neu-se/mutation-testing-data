 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last character of the word, instead of removing the last two characters when the word ends with 'us'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only remove the last two characters when the word has a length greater than 2, which would cause incorrect pluralization for some words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `slice` method instead of the `substr` method, which could result in different behavior for some edge cases.

DONE.
