  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an array-like object as the first argument, but `null` is not array-like and will cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an array-like object as the first argument, but `undefined` is not array-like and will cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an array-like object as the first argument, but `0` is not array-like and will cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
