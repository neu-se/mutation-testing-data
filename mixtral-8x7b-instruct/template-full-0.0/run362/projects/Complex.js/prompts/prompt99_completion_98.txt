 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1.23
```
This would result in different behavior because a constant number would be added to the imaginary part, changing the result of the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of 2 would be added to the imaginary part, changing the result of the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the input is not a number, instead of parsing it as a float. This would cause unexpected results in the `parse` function.

DONE.
