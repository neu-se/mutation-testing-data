  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the result is `false`, while the new code fragment checks if the result is `true`. This change would cause the `query` method to return `true` instead of `false` when the action is explicitly denied, which could lead to incorrect authorization decisions.

DONE.
