  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the counter instead of incrementing it, leading to unexpected results in the function's output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, -i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the counter instead of incrementing it, leading to unexpected results in the function's output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` instead of checking the end value, leading to unexpected results in the function's output.

DONE.
