  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice()` to create a new array of the trailing array elements starting from the provided index, while the replacement code fragment first reverses the array using `array_slice().reverse()` and then takes the slice, resulting in a different array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice()` to create a new array of the trailing array elements starting from the provided index, while the replacement code fragment uses `promises.slice()` to create a new array containing the elements of the `promises` array from the provided index to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice()` to create a new array of the trailing array elements starting from the provided index, while the replacement code fragment creates
