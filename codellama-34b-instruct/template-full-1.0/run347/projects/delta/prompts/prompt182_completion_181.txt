  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in an infinite loop, as the `while` loop condition would always be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in an infinite loop, as the `while` loop condition would always be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in an infinite loop, as the `while` loop condition would always be false.

DONE.
