 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the `fs.writeFile` function instead of wrapping it with `universalify.fromCallback`. This change would cause the `writeFile` and `writeFileSync` functions to fail if they are called in a non-Node.js environment, as `fs.writeFile` is not available in those environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify(fs.writeFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies the `universalify` function to `fs.writeFile` instead of `fs.writeFile.fromCallback`. This change would cause the `writeFile` and `writeFileSync` functions to fail if they are called in a non-Node.js environment, as `universalify` would not be able to handle the synchronous version of the `fs.writeFile` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
