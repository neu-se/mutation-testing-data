  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y, x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `x` is increased by 1, causing the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y, x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `x` is multiplied by 2, causing the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
