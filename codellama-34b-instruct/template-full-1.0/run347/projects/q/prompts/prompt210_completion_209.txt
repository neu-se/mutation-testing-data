  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to pass an empty array as arguments to `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch`, rather than passing the array of arguments from the current call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to pass `null` as the `this` value to `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch`, rather than passing the current `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to pass `undefined` as the first argument to `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch`, rather than passing the current `this` value.

DONE.
