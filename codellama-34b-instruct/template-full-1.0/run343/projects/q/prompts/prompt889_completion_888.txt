  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would produce a different result than `array_slice(arguments, 1)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` would produce a different result than `array_slice(arguments, 1)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would produce a different result than `array_slice(arguments, 1)`.

DONE.
