  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value, which could change the outcome of the `isPromise` check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value, which could change the outcome of the `isPromise` check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value, which could change the outcome of the `isPromise` check.

DONE.
