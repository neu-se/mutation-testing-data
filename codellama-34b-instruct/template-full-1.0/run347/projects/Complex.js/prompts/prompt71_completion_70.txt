  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\W+
```
This would result in different behavior because `\W+` matches any non-word character, including spaces and line breaks, whereas the original pattern only matches digits and the decimal point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\d+\.?\d*e[+-]?\d+|\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+
```
This would result in different behavior because this pattern matches numbers with scientific notation, which is not allowed in the original pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[\d+\.?\d*e[+-]?\d+|\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+]+
```
This would result in different behavior because this pattern matches one or more occurrences of the original pattern, which is not allowed in the original pattern.

DONE.
