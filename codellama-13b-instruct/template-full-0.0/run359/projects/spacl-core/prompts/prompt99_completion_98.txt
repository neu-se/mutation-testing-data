  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `policy.query` is a method call that takes three arguments, while the new code fragment `policy.query(path, verb, ctx)` is a method call that takes four arguments. This would cause the test to fail if the test suite is checking for the correct number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `policy.query` is a method call that takes three arguments, while the new code fragment `policy.query(path, verb)` is a method call that takes two arguments. This would cause the test to fail if the test suite is checking for the correct number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx, 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `policy
