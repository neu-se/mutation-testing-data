  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.state` can be either "pending", "fulfilled", or "rejected". By replacing the condition with `inspected.state === "fulfilled"`, the `valueOf` method will only return the value if the promise is fulfilled, and not if it is pending or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `inspected.state` can be either "pending", "fulfilled", or "rejected". By replacing the condition with `inspected.state !== "pending"`, the `valueOf` method will return the value if the promise is not pending, and not if it is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.value` can
