  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and therefore the `z['isInfinite']()` expression would evaluate to `undefined`. This would cause the `add` method to return `NaN` instead of `Infinity`, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and therefore the `z['isZero']()` expression would evaluate to `undefined`. This would cause the `add` method to return `NaN` instead of `Infinity`, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and
