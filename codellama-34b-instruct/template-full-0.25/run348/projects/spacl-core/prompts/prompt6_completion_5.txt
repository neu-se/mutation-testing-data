  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of the pattern in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match the pattern in a case-insensitive manner, so it would also match strings that have a lowercase "a" at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match the pattern in a multi-line manner, so it would also match strings that have a newline character at the beginning.

DONE.
