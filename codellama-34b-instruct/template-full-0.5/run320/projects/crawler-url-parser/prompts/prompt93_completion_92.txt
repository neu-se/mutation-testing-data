  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { normalizeHttps: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `normalizeHttps` option is set to `true`, which would normalize HTTPS URLs to HTTP.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { normalizeHttps: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `normalizeHttps` option is set to `false`, which would not normalize HTTPS URLs to HTTP.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, { normalizeHttps: !baseUrl.protocol.startsWith('https') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `normalizeHttps` option is set to the negation of the `baseUrl` protocol starting with `https`, which would normalize HTTPS URLs to HTTP if the `baseUrl` protocol does not start with `https
