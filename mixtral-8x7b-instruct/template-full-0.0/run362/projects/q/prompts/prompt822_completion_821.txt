 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method expects a promise as an argument, and null is not a promise. This would cause the `then` method chained to the result of `Q(<PLACEHOLDER>)` to throw an exception, which is different from the behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method expects a promise that is related to the promise chain it is called on. By replacing the placeholder with `Promise.resolve()`, the `done` method would not be part of the same promise chain, and the `onUnhandledError` function would not be called if an error occurs. This would result in unhandled rejections, which is different from the behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Buggy code fragment'))
