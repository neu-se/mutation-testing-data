  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of the `domain` variable, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain` variable is now undefined, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain` variable is now null, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch than the original code.

DONE.
