  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall(function () {
    return Q.reject(new Error("Test error"));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a test error, which would trigger the rejection handler in the `finally` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall(function () {
    return Q.resolve(123);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `123`, which would trigger the fulfillment handler in the `finally` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall(function () {
    return Q.when(Q.resolve(123));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `123`, which would trigger the fulfillment handler in the `finally` block
