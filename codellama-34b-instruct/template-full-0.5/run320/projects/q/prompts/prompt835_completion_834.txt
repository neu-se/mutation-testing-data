  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain && typeof process.domain.bind === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process.domain` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if `process.domain.bind` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain && typeof process.domain.onerror === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process.domain` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if `process.domain.onerror` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain && typeof process.domain.isActive === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process.domain` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if `process.domain.isActive` is a function.

DONE.
