  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/indices|index/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex pattern matches "index" or "appendix" case-insensitively, while the new pattern matches "indices" or "index" case-insensitively, which would cause the test to fail if the word to be pluralized is "index".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/indices/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex pattern matches "index" or "appendix" case-insensitively, while the new pattern matches "indices" case-insensitively, which would cause the test to fail if the word to be pluralized is "appendix".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ bazie/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex pattern matches "index" or "appendix" case-insensitively, while the new pattern matches "basis" case
