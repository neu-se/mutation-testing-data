  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a positive number, but -1 would cause the function to loop indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-zero number, but 0 would cause the function to exit immediately without performing any operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a finite number, but Infinity would cause the function to loop indefinitely.

DONE.
