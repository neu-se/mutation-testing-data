  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the function to exit immediately, without executing any further code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continue
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continue` statement would cause the loop to skip to the next iteration, without executing any further code in the current iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
break
```
This would result in different behavior because the `break` statement would cause the loop to exit immediately, without executing any further code.

DONE.
