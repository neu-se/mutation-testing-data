  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called on the `otherIter` object, which is an instance of `OpIterator`. This would cause the iterator to advance to the next element in the `other` delta's operations array, which is not the desired behavior in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called on the `thisIter` object, which is an instance of `OpIterator`. This would cause the iterator to advance to the next element in the `this` delta's operations array, which is not the desired behavior in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method is called on the `otherIter` object, which is an instance of `OpIterator`. This would cause the iterator to return the
