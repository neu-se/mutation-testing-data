  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\*/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\*/` matches any character, not just the asterisk character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\+/` matches any character, not just the plus character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\?/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\?/` matches any character, not just the question mark character.

DONE.
