  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` and `reject` are different methods in the `deferred` object, and using `reject` instead of `notify` would cause the promise to be rejected instead of notified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` and `deferred` are different objects, and using `promise.notify` instead of `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be notified instead of the deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a different object than `deferred`, and using `Q.notify` instead of `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be notified using a different object.

DONE.
