  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`null`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the callback function `cb`, while the new code fragment returns `null`, which would cause the function to always return `null` regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`undefined`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the callback function `cb`, while the new code fragment returns `undefined`, which would cause the function to always return `undefined` regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`false`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the callback function `cb`, while the new code fragment returns `false`, which would cause the function to always return `false` regardless of the input.

DONE.
