  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err instanceof Error ? err : null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `err` variable is directly compared to `true`, and if it is not `true`, then it is assumed to be an error object. In the mutated code, `err` is checked to be an instance of `Error` first, and if it is not, then it is assumed to be a non-error value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ?? null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `err` variable is directly compared to `true`, and if it is not `true`, then it is assumed to be an error object. In the mutated code, `err` is checked to be not `null` or `undefined` first, and if it is, then it is assumed to be a non-error value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
! err || null
```
This would result in different
