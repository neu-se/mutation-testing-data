Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && !onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because it will allow the `once` function to execute if `a` is true and `onEnd` is falsy, which is the opposite of the original logic that prevents execution if `a` is true or `onEnd` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because it will allow the `once` function to execute only if `a` is false and `onEnd` is truthy, which changes the conditions under which `onEnd` is called, potentially leading to missed callbacks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because it will allow the `once` function to execute if both `a` is true and `onEnd` is truthy, which contradicts the original logic and could lead to unintended calls to `onEnd`.

DONE.
