  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This code fragment will delete the key from the `_data` map, which is not the intended behavior of the `set` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This code fragment will set the value of the key to `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior of the `set` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This code fragment will set the value of the key to `null`, which is not the intended behavior of the `set` method.

DONE.
