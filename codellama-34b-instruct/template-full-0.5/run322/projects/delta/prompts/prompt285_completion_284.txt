  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be incremented by 1, which could affect the outcome of the `indexOf` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be decremented by 1, which could affect the outcome of the `indexOf` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other.length` property would be decremented by 1, which could affect the outcome of the `indexOf` method.

DONE.
