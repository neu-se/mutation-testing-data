  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the concatenation of the `src` string with an empty string, which would alter the result of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src - ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the difference between the `src` string and an empty string, which would also alter the result of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src * ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the multiplication of the `src` string with an empty string, which would return `NaN`, rather than the original result of the expression, which would preserve the contents of the `src` string.

DONE.
