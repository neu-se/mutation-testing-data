 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` condition would always be treated as false, and the `cb` function would always be called, even when the stream should have been aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, function(){}
