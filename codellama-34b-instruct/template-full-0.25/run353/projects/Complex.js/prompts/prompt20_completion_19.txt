  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 3000 || b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) to check if both `a` and `b` are less than 3000, while this replacement code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to check if either `a` or `b` is greater than 3000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 3000 && b === 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less-than operator (`<`) to check if both `a` and `b` are less than 3000, while this replacement code fragment uses the strict equality operator (`===`) to check if both `a` and `b` are equal to 3000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 3000 || b !==
