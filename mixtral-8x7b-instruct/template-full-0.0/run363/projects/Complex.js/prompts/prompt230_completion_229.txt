 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the result is flipped, which is not equivalent to the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt
