 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and the `fapply` method will throw an error when it tries to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that immediately resolves the promise with the given value, bypassing the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new, empty function, which does not have the same behavior as the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function. The `fapply` method will call this function, but it will not have the same behavior as the original function, which is used to resolve the promise with a Node.js-style callback.

DONE.
