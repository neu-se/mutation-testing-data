  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last element in the `arguments` array, potentially causing the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= length; i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over every other element in the `arguments` array, potentially causing the function to return a different value.

DONE.
