  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url + "123"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to have a different key, which would lead to a different set of URLs being extracted from the HTML.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to have a different key, which would lead to a different set of URLs being extracted from the HTML.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.replace("www.", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to have a different key, which would lead to a different set of URLs being extracted from the HTML.

DONE.
