  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== void 0
```
This code fragment checks if the `inspect` variable is not equal to `void 0`, which is a way to check if the variable is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === null
```
This code fragment checks if the `inspect` variable is equal to `null`, which is a way to check if the variable is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof inspect !== "undefined"
```
This code fragment checks if the `inspect` variable is not equal to the string "undefined", which is a way to check if the variable is defined.

DONE.
