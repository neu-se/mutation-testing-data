  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be subtracting 1 from the length of the word instead of 2, which would cause the resulting word to be one letter shorter than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the length of the word instead of subtracting 2, which would cause the resulting word to be one letter longer than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the length of the word by 2 instead of subtracting 2, which would cause the resulting word to be twice as long as the original.

DONE.
