Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() { return object; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves immediately with the original object instead of delaying the resolution by the specified timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the delay to zero milliseconds, causing the promise to resolve immediately instead of waiting for the specified timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout(1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a timeout mechanism that will reject the promise if it does not resolve within 1000 milliseconds, rather than simply delaying the resolution.

DONE.
