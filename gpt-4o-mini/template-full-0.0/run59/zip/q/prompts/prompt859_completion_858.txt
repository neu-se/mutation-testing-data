Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the original exception, it resolves the promise with a string indicating an error, which changes the promise's state from rejected to fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Custom rejection error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with a new error message instead of the original exception, potentially obscuring the original error context and changing how error handling is performed downstream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `notify` method instead of rejecting the promise, which is typically used for progress updates, thus not handling the error as a rejection and leaving the promise in a pending state.

DONE.
