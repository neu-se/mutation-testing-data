Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `attributes` even if there are no differences between `a` and `b`, as long as `a` has keys, potentially leading to false positives in the diff results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `attributes` only when `b` is empty, which means that if `b` has any keys, the function would incorrectly return `undefined`, ignoring any differences between `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).filter(key => a[key] !== b[key]).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for keys in `a` that differ from `b`, potentially missing differences where `b` has keys that are not present in `a`, leading to incomplete diff results.

DONE.
