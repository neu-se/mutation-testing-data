  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `cb` while this alternative uses `generate()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the result of `generate()` as an argument to `cb`, while this alternative passes the result of `cb` to `generate()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `generate()`, while this alternative uses `Math.random()`.

DONE.
