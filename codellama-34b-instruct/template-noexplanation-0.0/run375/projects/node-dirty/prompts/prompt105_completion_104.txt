  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This change will cause the `update` method to always set the value of the key to `undefined`, regardless of the value passed in the `updater` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This change will cause the `update` method to always set the value of the key to the next key in the database, regardless of the value passed in the `updater` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key - 1
```
This change will cause the `update` method to always set the value of the key to the previous key in the database, regardless of the value passed in the `updater` function.

DONE.
