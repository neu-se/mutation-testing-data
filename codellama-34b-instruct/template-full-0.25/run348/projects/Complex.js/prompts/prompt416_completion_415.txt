  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a` and adds 1, while this new code fragment calculates the square of `a` and subtracts 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a` and adds 1, while this new code fragment calculates the square of `a` and adds `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a` and adds 1, while this new code fragment calculates the square of `a` and subtracts `a`.

DONE.
