  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument and use the second argument as the list of arguments to pass to the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments starting from the third argument to the `post` method, instead of just passing the first two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[arguments[0], arguments[2]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first and third arguments to the `post` method, instead of passing all the arguments.

DONE.
