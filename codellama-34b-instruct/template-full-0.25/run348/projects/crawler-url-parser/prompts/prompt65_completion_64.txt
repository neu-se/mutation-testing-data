  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.hostname` would return the hostname without the subdomain, whereas `ret.host` returns the full hostname with the subdomain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.host.split('.')[0]` would return the first part of the hostname, whereas `ret.host` returns the full hostname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.replace(/\./g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.host.replace(/\./g, '')` would return the hostname without any dots, whereas `ret.host` returns the full hostname with dots.

DONE.
