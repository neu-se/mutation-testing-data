  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/g, function(w) { return w.split('').reverse().join('') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the same word as the replaced code fragment, but the replaced code fragment uses the word reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/g, function(w) { return w.substr(1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the same word as the replaced code fragment, but the replaced code fragment uses a substring of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER
