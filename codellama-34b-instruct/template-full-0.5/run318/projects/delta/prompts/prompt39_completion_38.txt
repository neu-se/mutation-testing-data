  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the property is not undefined. This would cause the `transform` function to behave differently when a property is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the property is not undefined in the `b` object. This would cause the `transform` function to behave differently when a property is undefined in the `b` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the property is null. This would cause the `transform` function to behave differently when a property is null.

DONE.
