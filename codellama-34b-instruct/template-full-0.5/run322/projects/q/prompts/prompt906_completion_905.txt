  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is `undefined`, while this code fragment checks if it is not `undefined`. This would cause the function to behave differently when a callback is passed, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is `undefined`, while this code fragment checks if it is not `null`. This would cause the function to behave differently when a callback is passed, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is `undefined`, while this code fragment checks if it is not the string `"undefined"`. This would cause the function to behave differently when a callback is passed, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
