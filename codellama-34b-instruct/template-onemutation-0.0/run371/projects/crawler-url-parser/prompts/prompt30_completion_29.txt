  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with "http://" if it is not already present in the URL, while the modified code fragment always replaces the protocol with "https://", regardless of whether it is already present or not.
