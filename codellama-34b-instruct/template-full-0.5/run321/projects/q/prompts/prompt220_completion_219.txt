  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable to `true`, regardless of its previous value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG = !process.env.Q_DEBUG;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the value of the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable each time the code is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG = Math.random() < 0.5;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly set the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable to either `true` or `false` each time the code is executed.

DONE.
