  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while the modified code fragment uses the uppercase version of the `word` variable. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the uppercase version of the word.
