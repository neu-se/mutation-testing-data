  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the value of `op` to be incremented by 1, which would change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would cause the value of `op` to be decremented by 1, which would also change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would cause the value of `op` to be multiplied by 2, which would also change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
